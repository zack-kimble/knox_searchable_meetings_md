| 0:05:57| of people who run the races, but also thousands of volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| who line the streets to cheer them on, hand out water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| play music, and just make it a fun community event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| So I want to thank Knoxville Police Department, Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| Fire Department, city special events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=371)|

| 0:06:15| make this weekend possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| It's a weekend of activities, but the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| and logistics and training that go into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| takes at least a year of preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| So many thanks to everyone for making it possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| And just a reminder to council and to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| there will be quite a few road closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| for the races Saturday evening and Sunday morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| so please plan accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| Also, it's April, so that means in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| that dogwood trails are officially open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| and will be all month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| The iconic dogwood trails cover more than 90 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| in 13 neighborhoods throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| These trails are a great way to enjoy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| the scenic natural beauty of our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| And at least the dogwoods I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| are right now in full bloom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| I hope the wind tonight doesn't blow off all the blossoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| We will have a kickoff week celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| this Thursday, 5 p.m. at Talahi Park in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| So council, please come join us if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| Finally, a quick reminder about our rules of decorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| Those who wish to speak either to a specific agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| or during public forum should sign up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| with the city recorder ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| Please do not use profanity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| and when speaking to specific agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| remember to stay on topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| Robert's rules require that any discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| of an agenda item be germane to that topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| Those who fail to adhere to these rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| may be ruled out of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| and asked to step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| For those who are listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| please note that you may not disrupt a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| Those who do may be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| Thank you in advance for everyone's respect for these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| That does it for my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| Now, are there any reports of council members or committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| Council Member Helsley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| Quickly, quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Yes, ma'am, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| CAT will restore hours to most routes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| effective April the 8th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| from the ones that were cut during COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| There's a few exceptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| and those will be the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| that are impacted by CAT reimagined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| but we can't go through that whole presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| So catbus.com will tell you which ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| but most of them will be restored, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| Six days or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| I just wanted to recognize Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| She was recently recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| as the Ethel Beck Society 2024 Woman of the Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| So just wanted to say, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| Yeah, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| As my council report tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| I'd like to make some comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| on the March 19th council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| and the past two weeks that have passed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| What remains strongest for me from that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| is the image of this assembly room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| filled with two ethnic minorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| pitted against each other, angry and grieving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| And it all felt like it was on the verge of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| My understanding of what the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| was actually having us vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| is that a yes vote meant that the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| requests our federal representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| to uphold the order of the International Court of Justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| that South Africa filed against Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| That feels way out of my lane and out of my expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| What it seems to have devolved into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| is that not voting on this meant that the council or me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| that we don't care about suffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| and the killing of civilians in the Middle East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| In my conversations over the last two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| many of my constituents have told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| that they felt the resolution was interpreted as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| either the city council supports Muslim folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| or Jewish people and that we had to pick sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| That was not a simple ceasefire resolution in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| At the meeting, I regret that I was unable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| to verbalize my full thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| Clearly, in my defense, I had about a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| to tend to the typical city issues on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| and then read and comprehend the 80 plus pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| of the International Court of Justice report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| while receiving almost 200 emails on this topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| and about 30 phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| all filled with pain and or anger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| Now, adding the tension that night in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| I was more than overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Ironically, this was supposed to be a peace resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| but it felt weaponized and made me feel backed into a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=642)|
| 0:10:50| Since then, I have looked into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| and found that there've been about 100 local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| that have passed a resolution on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| About the same amount of local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| have voted down a resolution like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| The main difference with those that passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| is that they had gone through a collaborative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| community-based process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| and were about the city supporting peace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| not about telling our federal representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| that they must follow a ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| by the International Court of Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| Moving forward, I believe the pain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| that's been brought to our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| by this resolution is still very raw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| and the situation in the Middle East has gotten worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| When we are able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| I would like to see an ethnically inclusive local process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| to come together and find Knoxville's words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| to create a resolution that is about healing and peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| I would be happy to host that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| and it's a resolution I would vote yes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| I did not prepare a council report this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| but I feel compelled to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| since I am the author of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| that was just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| The resolution that was before us on March 19th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=733)|
| 0:12:22| was, as I call it, a legal resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| The first resolution that we considered in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| took a position, and it took a clear position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| because members of our community were upset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| that the mayor spoke on behalf of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| and made the public statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| that Knoxville stands with Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| So members of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| a diverse coalition of members of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| including Jewish members, including Muslim members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| Christian, those not of faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| racial minorities, came together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| and they wrote that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| I added some words to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| but they primarily wrote that resolution in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| We weren't able to bring another resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| with similar language within a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| and so the focus of the resolution had to shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| And the shift went to simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| the legal process at hand currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| and recognizing that as a local city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| we also are sworn to uphold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| the Constitution of the United States of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| The Constitution includes our obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| to adhere to international law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| So I found it completely appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| that we would speak as a local body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| as has been done by this local body in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| although not in recent times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| but in the past, this local body has spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| on those international issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| especially when it impacts our residents directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| We engaged in almost a month-long process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| to reach out to council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| to reach out to others in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| to have a conversation about the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| And community members reported back to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| that they felt good about either the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| that they would receive on the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| or the lack of opposition that they would receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| But that wasn't the experience that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| on March 19th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| And I believe that's why many people are upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| They're upset by how they were treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| when they arrived at the city county building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| and weren't able to enter the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| even though the balcony was empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| Those who had signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| weren't able to come to the podium and speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| because they were locked outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| and so other speakers came forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| That was an extremely frustrating experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| Yes, emotions were high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| but our job as elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| are to be able to act regardless of those emotions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| especially when legally we have an obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| Now, I am someone who believes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| we should uphold human rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| Are we, is our international community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| is our international human rights system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| one that has clear consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| when city council doesn't speak up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| But as someone who has worked for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| educating the public about the Genocide Convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| and helping community members understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| what our role is at every level of society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| and every level of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| to prevent genocide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| I absolutely feel it is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| for city councils and local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| to speak out on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| especially when our federal legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| have been quite outspoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| about their actions in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| the conflict in Israel and Palestine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| So I also welcome a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| that would involve more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| I reached out to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| that I could think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| who would have an interest in this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| and was disappointed to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| that our mayor participated in some sort of convening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| but did not reach out to council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| especially those taking the lead on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| to be a part of those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| She didn't reach out to members of the Muslim community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| who have been showing up with concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| on these issues to be a part of those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| So yes, absolutely, please consider me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| in support of any effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| to bring our community together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| around any issue, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| but definitely around this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| It is not directly within our jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| but I absolutely believe it's a role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| that we have a duty to play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| to ensure that we are upholding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| our obligations under the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Council members, just before we move to the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| any further committee reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| I did want to let everybody know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| at 6.08 p.m. a tornado watch was issued for our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| and I see that Mr. Ickes is in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| So Mr. Ickes, if there's anything we need to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| please interrupt and let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| We'll be watching our phones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| but he's the director of KEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| Just let us know if we need to know anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| and take shelter or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| more than we already are sheltered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Council member Ryder, did you have a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| So hopefully, well, many of you may have noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| the large construction project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| and very large tractors on the Broadway corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| the lower part north of First Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| This is impacting the businesses in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| and some of them are having difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| Their customers aren't as easily able to visit with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| and some of our media did a story on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| I would like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| I've talked to one of the businesses there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| that was interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Well, first off, let me back up and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| thank you to KUB for the work that's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| because we do need the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| and the businesses need the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| So there's a lot of necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| infrastructure improvements going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| In the meantime, there's some businesses there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| their business has lightened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| So I'd like to propose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| and I appreciate that Councilman Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| has offered to come join me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| and I invite you all to come join me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| because I'll give him the credit for the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| It is next Wednesday on April 10th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1156)|

| 0:19:30| 2012 North Broadway at the Time Out Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| It's a small, local-owned business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| Charlie, I hope that means you're gonna join us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| Councilman Thomas is smiling, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| And anyway, so they have a lot of great sandwiches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| and salads as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| So come join me and help support this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| as they are behind some barriers and a bunch of tractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| and the traffic is kind of log jammed in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| Hopefully we can bring a lunch mob to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| and if you're not able to join on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1199)|

| 0:20:07| so this is several months of impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| to those businesses along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1210)|

| 0:20:14| but you can also park on Cecil if you can't get in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| because that is blockaded off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| So let me know if you wanna join| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| and you have some issues with parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| but I hope people will join us and support the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1223)|

| 0:20:41| the announcement that Council Member Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| just gave publicly, does that serve as a sunshining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| that event for other council members that may attend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| If we're all here, as long as we're all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| As long as you don't talk business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| I mean, talk about their great hoagies, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1255)|

| 0:21:06| Okay, moving right along to item 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1266)|

| 0:21:16| to update the Knoxville Fire Department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| records retention schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| Motion made to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1281)|

| 0:21:30| of the records retention change to the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| If you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| and you'll have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| to speak on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| Yeah, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| My name's Tom Ruggles, with the Knoxville District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| Today we gather to discuss a support matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| that concerns the addition of a pump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| to the parking of our city and the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| of the residents here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| So we are deliberate upon a proposed resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| to amend certain sections of Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| to change the records retention schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| Oh, appreciate you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| I thought I was sounding a little quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| So yeah, we're gonna talk about the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| and their keeping of records today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| And this is a very critical part of our city services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| So, you know, let me begin by acknowledging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| the significance of maintaining accurate maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| and up-to-date records, especially within departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| tasked with ensuring public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| as with our esteemed fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| You know, records, they serve as a backbone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| to accountability and allowing us to track incidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| and monitor compliance with regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| and ultimately enhance the effectiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| of our emergency response, which is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| In developing these protocols, we ought to seek inspiration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| from the health ministry of Gaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| because this is an organization that has demonstrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| the utmost attention to record-keeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| even under the most difficult conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| As of yesterday, they have documented the murder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| of over 33,000 Palestinians in Gaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| over the past six months, and the latest escalation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| by the state of Israel's genocide in Palestine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| Without their steadfast commitment to record-keeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| we would not know the scale of this genocidal onslaught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| So these proposed amendments outlined in-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Mr. Ruggles, please keep to the task at hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| of the Knoxville Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| records retention policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Yeah, I just wanted to outline the importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| of keeping records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| And so, you know, this proposed resolution 9A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| you know, we seek to align our records retention schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| with the recommendations provided by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| the Municipal Technology Advisory Service Institute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| for Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| This guidance, based on best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| and industry standards, aims to streamline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| our record-keeping process to ensure consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| across municipal departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| While I'm in favor of this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| I wish the City Council would employ similar reasoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| For example, distinguished bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| such as the International Court of Justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| and the UN Human Rights Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| have called for the end of Israeli war crimes in Gaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Again, Mr. Ruggles, please keep to the germane topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| of the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| And yet this body refuses to support resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Mr. Ruggles, you have to speak to the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Public forum, you can talk about whatever you wish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| but this is about agenda item 9A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| Knoxville Fire Department's records retention schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| So yeah, I would like there to be some consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| among our, how we approach resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| So in essence, what we're judging today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| is not merely just bureaucratic paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| but rather a fundamental aspect of how we fulfill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| our duty to protect and serve the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| And by adopting the suggested changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| we demonstrate our commitment to transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| accountability, and continuous improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| in the delivery of essential public services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| You all are representatives of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| and let you give the cold shoulder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| to Knoxville's Palestinian community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| who are, of course, these constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| You said we stand with Israel, but remain silent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| in the face of the murder of 33,000 Palestinians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Again, Mr. Ruggles, thank you for keeping it germane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| Okay, next person is Ellis Connolly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| speaking in opposition to item 9A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| which again, the topic is the Knoxville Fire Department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1525)|

| 0:25:29| Ms. Connolly, or Mr. Connolly, Ellis Connolly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| Thank you, Mr. Connolly, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| Please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| and please stay on the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Yes, ma'am, Ellis Connolly, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| I believe it's District Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| Please forgive me of my stuttering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| this is my first time speaking before the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| I just wanted to speak on the topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| of updating fire department records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| and updating record keeping within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| such an esteemed Knoxville public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| Certainly it is useful to, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| keep up to date with records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| and more importantly, ensure that such records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| are presented in an up to date format,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| and easily accessible to all citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| However, it is my concern that when we are looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| at updating record keeping software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| or record keeping methods, that we don't, well, neglect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| and we make sure to take care that we don't neglect the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| for lack of better terms, previous records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| After all, there has been multiple occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| where, in history, records have been lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| due to shifts in record keeping strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| For example, in the case of the Israeli Defense Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| continually murdering Palestinians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Mr. Connolly, that is not germane to the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Please keep to the topic. Sorry, I was just willing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| just wanting to give an example of faulty record keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| For example, when the Israeli, should I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| offensive force murders thousands of Palestinians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| Mr. Connolly, that is not germane to the topic at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| Please talk about the Knoxville Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| or city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| This is the requirement of the Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| You have to speak in a germane way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| to the topic on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Apologies, Mayor Ken Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Well, I just want to make sure that we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| making mistakes with record keeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| such as organizations like that offensive force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| take when recording, say, casualties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| in certain situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| And casualties are something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| are kept track of when we talk about the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| After all, fires are very deadly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| And fires, they come with a lot of, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| for lack of better terms, unforeseen circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| unforeseen consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| I don't really have a lot to say or a lot of knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| in regards to specific fire department records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| But I just want to ensure that we are not, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| losing anything in the process of changing such a strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| It's really all I have to say about the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| Council, that concludes the people who signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1711)|

| 0:28:37| 9B is an ordinance to amend the Knox City Code, Chapter 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| Article 1, Section 2-4, relative to the oath of office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| taken by police officers and firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1727)|
| 0:28:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1727)|

| 0:28:50| There are two people signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| First in favor is Mr. Ellis Connelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| Mr. Connelly, you have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| to speak on item 9B, which pertains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| to the oath of office taken by police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| and firefighters in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| Thank you very much, Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Apologies for being winded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| I stood up really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| Well, I am not privy to the exact details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| of how the oaths of office are taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| and will be changed due to the consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| However, it is my understanding that the oath of office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| is taken to defend the US Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| and to defend the American people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| and to defend the privileges that Americans hold dear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| and the rights that Americans fight for and also hold dear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| Well, in light of these recent changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| we need to also keep in mind, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| the specifics of what is called for by the US Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| And it's very important that these stipulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| be included whenever such a consideration is made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| or whenever such a change is made to the oath of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| When a police officer or a fire department official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| pledges their oath to defend Americans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| defend the US Constitution, and defend our rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| as American citizens, they need to also know that entails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| well, defending the rights of minority groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| and defending the rights of ethnic minorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| religious minorities, sexual orientation-related minorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| or to not go on any further or go on for too long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| minorities in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| I mean, for example, following the US Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| might require following and stipulating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| under certain international laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| such as determination international laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| about minority rights, the UN Declaration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| of the Rights of Man, and the Universal Declaration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| of Human Rights, which stipulates such a thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| as what is genocide and what is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| Excuse me, Mr. Connolly, that's not germane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| The changes on this agenda item have nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| to do with those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| And the US Constitution elements of it are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| The US Constitution elements are the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| The oath of office is not changing anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| about the US Constitution or the firefighters or police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| officers' commitments to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Sorry, I was under the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| that police officers and fire department officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| had to pledge an oath to the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| I wasn't aware that that wasn't being changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| Well, it's good to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| It's good to know that our esteemed officials are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| pledging an oath to uphold international law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| and to uphold the laws of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| and defend the rights of minorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| and defends the right of politically oppressed groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| such as those in Palestine, which I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| assured is not being changed in this resolution, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| is very good, because that would be very bad if we had police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| officers and fire department officials running around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| who did not defend those rights and who did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| have those assurances at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1928)|

| 0:32:16| to the proposed changes in the oath of office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| taken by Knoxville Police and Firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| Mr. Ruggles, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| My name is Tom Ruggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| I live in Knoxville District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| So talking about this Ordinance 9B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| which seeks to amend the oath administered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| to both the Knoxville Police and Fire Departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| this does, on the surface, look like a procedural matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| However, there are, of course, some deeper implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| when you look at the text of the oath of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| Particularly pertaining to the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| So I'm going to speak to that in the context of ongoing police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| and state violence, both here in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| and abroad, as is relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| And so the oath of officers is very masked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| It mentions nothing of the duty to serve and protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| Rather, it says, quote, I will support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| the Constitution of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| and the Constitution of the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| and the Charter and Ordinances of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| It doesn't say anything about protecting or serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| And unfortunately, in my short four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| of living in this city, I've seen firsthand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| multiple instances of police being weaponized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| against the people of Knoxville, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| is my concern against this resolution today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| The first instance of this was the arrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| of local activists in Zinga Armani| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| on a trumped up warrant last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| ironically at a public hearing about the hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| of a new police chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| This was a clear misuse of state power to silence activists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| The second interest was not even a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| when at a rally in March calling for a ceasefire in Palestine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| police officers behaved incredibly dangerously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| and violently towards protesters for no reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| other than their own personal frustrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| with the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| On top of this, the officers grabbed and shoved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| multiple people and even arrested one man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| without much pretext.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| The records department is protecting the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| from public scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| An example of this is I've been denied a body cam footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| request under the guise of it pertaining to an active case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| despite my request not featuring the individual who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| was arrested, nor the arresting officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| and occurred 30 minutes before the arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| So this is another example of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| the police are protecting each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| and not serving the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| Additionally on that day, I witnessed cops directing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| traffic by signaling motorists to pull up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| literally within this close of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| who were crossing the street, a clear misuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| and dangerous operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2116)|
| 0:35:24| And of course, those are here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| will wave their hand and disregard what I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| and say that this is merely a procedural manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| and that they are just words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| But words are often more than just words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| They're ideas that shape actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Take what Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| said in 1944.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| Arab villages inside the Jewish state must resist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| or they will be destroyed and their inhabitants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| will be expelled from the Jewish state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Which is the oath of office to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| taken by Knoxville police officers and Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Yeah, I don't understand the line here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| because this does pertain in that it's somebody speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| and how that shapes their actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| It's my decision about what's germane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| and I don't think that things happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| across the other side of the planet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| are germane to this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Interesting, especially considering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| I would say, this body should be particularly concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| about things happening in Israel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| considering our mayor participated in Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| Interchange, which was a direct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Again, stay on topic, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| That's not relevant to the topic on item 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| Well, I mean, you went to Israel to learn about the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| that they conduct their state, and part of their state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| is police conduct, which is what I'm talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| Please talk about this item and this item only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| I'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| So should we fail to scrutinize the working of this oath?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| Sorry, let me find something perhaps you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| won't immediately shoot down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| Anyway, I say all this to say that I'm against this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| resolution because it does not call for the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| to actually serve the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| I recall examples listed above are examples of legal malice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| used against the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| And speaking of legal malice used against the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| we can't deny that there are other instances where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| state power is used against the people in ways that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| are said to be legal by certain entities that may lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| to certain conductions of war crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| That concludes your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Council members, that concludes the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| who have signed up to speak on item 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Are there any other questions or discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| among council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| Oh, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Lights are not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Yes, we've experienced that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| So please wave your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| And also, I'll try to look at your microphone lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| I'm not sure what the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2283)|
| 0:38:11| The interruptions during public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| concerned me because I was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| trying to listen to what the speaker had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| And the fact that you did travel to Israel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| and we don't know exactly what lessons you brought back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| from that, and it impacts our law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| I believe the public should be able to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| Even when it comes to a change in the oath of office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| because we have no information, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| should allow them space to ask their questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| about what lessons are we pulling from Israel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| and how is that impacting our local police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| including the oath of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| Any other comments or questions before Council Member Fugitt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| and Council Member McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| I would like to speak to what I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| can settle this question about the change of the oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| I went to the last installation of the class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| where they took the oath of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| And the oath of office had words in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| about being elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| It's the same oath we take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| Police and fire are not elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| That is the language that is being removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| from the oath of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| And during the meeting, during the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| I thought, that's strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| They're saying our oath, so it's an attempt to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Yeah, that's accurate, Ms. Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| And it certainly was brought to my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| in a very clear way when we were administering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| the oath of office to Officer Antoine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| as he was dying in this hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| that it contained a lot of extraneous things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| And so that was what was the immediate impetus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| There's nothing nefarious about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| They're not elected officials, so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| taking that language out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| Council Member McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| Attorney Frost, I just want a point of clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| as it relates to comments on agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| Those should be on topic specific to the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| Is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| Yes, Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| So I just wanted to say that it is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| that we don't want to hear the thoughts of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| our constituents who are here today and who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| But a lot of the conversation and the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| that I'm hearing are more appropriate, as you stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| Mayor, for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| That would be the context in which those types of views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| and feelings should be expressed to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| And I think that it sounds like they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| being used intertwined with agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| and it kind of stifles our business when that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| So I hope that the speakers have signed up for public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| so you can have your full five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| to share exactly what it is that you'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| like for us to hear on your stances on the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| are important to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2480)|
| 0:41:20| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Mayor, you didn't call on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| You had a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| I had another comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| Just in terms of our rules, because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| think it's very clear to the public, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| the public members who come quite often to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2498)|
| 0:41:47| What our rules are and what I heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| what I was listening very closely for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| was for comments to be tied back to the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| And I'm very, very uncomfortable with a definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| of what can and cannot be said during that moment being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| dependent on how those comments make you feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| whether you feel uncomfortable with those comments or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| As long as someone is bringing the topic back to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| item, I believe that's within city council rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| Is it uncomfortable to hear what to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| may seem like a simple topic, but to someone in the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| they may be viewing it as a completely different topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| Is that uncomfortable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Do we want to rush it along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| Do we want to get through this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| Everybody wants to be out of here by 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| I can understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| But as long as they bring it back to the topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| I don't believe that we should limit their ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| to make their public comment on that agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| I would agree with that statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| if that is what they were actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| interested in doing instead of just making a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| I think the points that they want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| are very welcome at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| When I make decisions as presiding officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| over these council meetings, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| not based on my personal feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| It's based on the council's own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| And the rules on being germane are very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| And that's how I'm making my decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| And so I believe that most council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| agree with those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| And I'm doing the best I can to interpret your rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| and make the city's business move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| in a reasonable manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Council Member Parker, do you have another comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| I just feel very uncomfortable when we say, I support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| but I don't believe that was their intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| We don't know what the intention is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| We can't assume what someone's intention is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| No, we have to listen to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| And I will continue to object when public speakers are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| interrupted if when they're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| bringing it back to the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| Even if they are bringing into issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| that you aren't comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| Even if they're bringing in issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| that you don't feel like are relevant to the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| But to them, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| So I think we can sit through five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| as long as people are bringing it back to the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| They're not talking about whatever they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| It has to come back to the agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| that we can sit for five minutes and listen to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2676)|
| 0:44:43| All those opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| OK, motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| Next item, C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| 9C is an ordinance to close a portion of McElroy Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| from the east side of Varner Street and McElroy Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| intersection to approximately 200 feet east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| and authorizing the mayor to execute quit claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| deeds to the adjacent property owner's urban engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| applicant's sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| Council members, two people have signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| Mr. Ruggles is speaking in favor of item 9C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| Again, a reminder, the topic is closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| a portion of McElroy Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| Mr. Ruggles, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| Before I get started, I'd just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| to say that I don't appreciate the notion that I was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| genuine in my concern over the oath in the previous measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| I have come before this body to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| on issues of policing and attended numerous public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| meetings relating to policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| And so I just feel I have a right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| to defend the comments being made directly against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| But I will begin my five minutes now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| Yeah, Tom Ruggles, 9 o'clock has started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| So we're here to talk about 9C, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| proposes to close McElroy Avenue to the east side of Varner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| Street approximately 200 feet to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| And this closure of this avenue represents an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| for progress and development within our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| And it allows Urban Engineering Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| to proceed with their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| And we are paving the way for new buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| and new opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| However, as we consider the positive impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| of this ordinance, I cannot help but notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| its juxtaposition with the devastation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| that we have seen in Israel, where over 70% of the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| in Gaza have been destroyed over the past six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| As residents of Knoxville, we have a responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| to stand in solidarity with positive development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2804)|
| 0:46:51| both here and abroad, including those suffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| under occupation and colonization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| And while the closure of McElroy Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| may seem insignificant in comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| to these larger geopolitical issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| it's a tangible reminder of our privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| that we have here in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| where we are able to take up such projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| and not have them torn down by violent oppressors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| Therefore, I urge my fellow Knoxvillians, council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2837)|
| 0:47:25| to support this Ordinance 9C and affirm our dedication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| to building a brighter future here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| Let us seize this opportunity to create positive change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| and advance common good, both here and in solidarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| with those struggling for freedom and justice abroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| I appreciate all of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| Next person signed up to speak to Item 9C in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| is Mr. Ellis Connolly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Mr. Connolly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| Thank you very much for your time and for your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| and for your sincere listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| We are here to speak today and consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| the closing of a, to some minor but to others major,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| thoroughfare through the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| Now there are many angles we can take this from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| but I am opposed to this endeavor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| and I'm opposed to this action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| First off, the closing of this, again, to some people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| minor thoroughfare but to others major,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| does bring about the opportunity for progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| in terms of developing our economic sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| and developing more opportunities for tourists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| to come in Knoxville and enable Knoxville citizens to better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| move around the city that they hold so dear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| However, I'm opposed to this because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| believe our attention needs to be focused elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| development-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| First off, when we're speaking of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| there is no more pressing development in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| than housing, than in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| We have a major housing crisis here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| And while I am no housing expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| I certainly know that many of my friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| have faced housing insecurity and have faced injustice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| when going through the process of, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| applying for a mortgage or, more pressingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| dealing with their landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| There are many situations in history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| where this has been the case, but in Knoxville specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| situations such as the usage of eminent domain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| do not bode well for the average Knoxville citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| Because development of the economic sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| often comes with the underdevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| of Knoxville's, pardon the phrasing, I'll restart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| It comes with the underdevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| of our ability to house and maintain our own citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=2996)|
| 0:50:03| We need only look to other cities in the country who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| have also had housing crises, such as in New York, Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| many cities in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Apologies, the names are not coming to mind at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| I'm a bit flustered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| But all that to say, say, economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| should not take precedence over focusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| on development for the good of Knoxville citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| I mean, after all, a lack of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| is partially what causes lots of disasters worldwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| We saw in Hurricane Katrina that the lack of accommodations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| and ability to support the displaced population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| within that city not only led to more deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| than the disaster itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| We see in other disasters, such as hurricanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| and such as the recent tornado that blew through Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| that it was the loss of housing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| resulted in the pain and suffering of so many citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| We see in the occupation of Gaza, in Israel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| that it's not just the bombs and the slaughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| and the bullets that are causing this suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| Mr. Connolly, please stay germane to the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| I'll get back to housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| Don't worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| And I'll get back to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| We see that the destruction of the developed housing in Gaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| development is what is causing starvation and spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| of disease to run rampant through these populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| And that's not related to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| I don't know what is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| I don't know what is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| We need to focus on developing for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| We need to focus on developing for the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| and not purely for profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| And that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| OK, council members, any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3124)|

| 0:53:11| But I'm from District 1 in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| I would appreciate your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| This is my first time speaking in front of the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| So I think we all understand how important public safety is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| When our community is in danger, it is important to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| When a child goes missing, it is imperative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| that we step up to the plate and look for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| When there is a natural disaster threatening our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| we must be able to respond and act quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| This is something that is true everywhere, not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| And I would appreciate the council's patience with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| I am going to be talking about something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| But we'll be wrapping it back up to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| like Councilwoman Parker said that we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| So like I said, this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| that is true for everywhere, not just Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| Take Palestine, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| As I'm sure we all know, communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| has been destroyed in Gaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| Keep it relevant to Kima and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| Ma'am, I just said that I will be wrapping it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| I appreciate your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| As I'm sure we all know, communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| has all been destroyed in Gaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| Families cannot contact each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| Children go missing every day under rubble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| And disaster comes without warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| The crisis goes on in Palestine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| And it is not one that our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| should stay neutral on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| It is obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| I'm sorry, Ms. Funk, this is not relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| Tie it back into the agenda item at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| What's happening there is not germane to this agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| One moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| Point of clarification, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| When Katrina was used as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| there was no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| But now we have Palestine being used as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| And you're objecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| Can we not allow the speaker to share her example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| and then bring it back to Knoxville to make her point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| I think that her comments need to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| at least on this side of inside our own country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| as not just our own county and state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| I respectfully disagree with that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| We have hundreds of Palestinian Muslims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| who live in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| And even though I am not one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| I know that I speak for them when I bring up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| the tragedy that is happening and trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| to prevent a tragedy like that happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| Ms. Funk, you have two and a half minutes left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| to talk to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| Please keep it local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3346)|
| 0:55:53| So let me change gears for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| When I moved to Knoxville, I moved to Knoxville in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| I came here because I understood that East Tennesseans were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| some of the kindest people I've ever met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| When the big freeze happened, my car got stuck multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| And strangers helped me to safety each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| This is a genuine love that permeates this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| So this love that permeates this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| that we have for the safety of the emergency radio systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| And we can support these radio systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| But I just fail to see why that can't be supported everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| While I appreciate the council for wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| to support these systems here, I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| like it is our duty as human beings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| to support them everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| In the end, I believe in public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| I believe in the safety of our people and people everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| I believe in doing what we must to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| that this vision takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| I believe in passing resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| that better our community, whether that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| be on a city, nationwide, or international scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| To believe that we as Knoxvillians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| do not have power on an international scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| only disenfranchises us as the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| It takes away our power to work within our borders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| and beyond them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| I know many Knoxvillians who refuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| to subscribe to this belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| I count myself as one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| So as a Knoxvillian, I call on you, my elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| to do as the people have demanded of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| not only to pass this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| but also pass a ceasefire resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| for the people of Palestine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Council, that concludes the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| signed up to speak on item 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| to execute any and all documents necessary to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| for and, if awarded, accept a grant from the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| Wildlife Resource Agency in the amount of $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| for the purpose of funding a new public boat dock at Century| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| Landing Park for a project cost not to exceed $535,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| including a $135,000 local match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Council members, one person has signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| to speak in favor of this, Madison Fung.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| Ms. Fung, again, the topic is a boat dock in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3504)|
| 0:58:34| Please keep it on that topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| I have to say I'm all for building a public dock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| at the Century Landing Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| This will be a great opportunity for our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| to come together on waterfront events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| from fishing tournaments to simply spending a day out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| on the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| I know many people would be excited to have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| that offers us better access to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| Did you know that docks can be vital for many communities'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| ways of life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| From Venice, which is the city of Gondolas, to Japan, where-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3545)|

| 0:59:11| Ma'am, I'm using an example of how this can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| make our city more vibrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| From Venice, which is the city of Gondolas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| to Japan, where even a large portion of their diet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| consists of fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3564)|
| 0:59:36| One moment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3576)|
| 0:59:46| Many people come here from all over the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| all over the world to visit us, to visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| our beautiful college campuses, to visit the beautiful mountains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| that we call home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| When it comes to the internationality of this kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| we accept it freely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3602)|

| 1:00:06| to those who admire us, we snub our noses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| and say that we don't have a foreign policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| Again, Ms. Fung, talking about a fishing boat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| dock in Century Landing, not foreign policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3616)|
| 1:00:23| Another issue with this pier in Palestine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| relates to the Knoxville, and the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| that the Gaza Sea, there are thousands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| of pounds of natural gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| How can we be sure that this dock isn't there just as a ploy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| to take their natural resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| I'm going to have to ask you to stick to local topic at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| I'm sure we can take the dock supposed in Century| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| to have the same effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| One thing in Palestine and eastern Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| have in common is exploitation for natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| From our timber and coal, to their farmlands and nuns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| and natural gas, the United States government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| has made it sure to keep us disenfranchised enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| to exploit those raw resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| I know many people here and across eastern Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| who have lost their fathers to the dangers of the coal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| industry, and the pollution that it causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| Ms. Fung, Ms. Fung, this is not germane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| Please keep your comments to the topic at hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| which is item 9C, funding a new public boat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| dock at Century Landing Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| While I'm here, I'm going to ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| to support a new public boat dock at Century Landing Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| While I am in favor of this boat dock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| I am concerned about the fish and the pollution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| that they have been ingesting because of the pollution that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| comes from all of our coal plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| I see that this is pretty relevant to today's topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3689)|
| 1:01:37| Oh my god, my glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| This is something that we can unite on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| something that we should see as a common struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| We should open our eyes to the fact that under this system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| we are exploited, and thus bring the realization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| that there is no us versus them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| It is all of us together, which, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| is why I'm calling on the city to recognize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| I am calling on the city council to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| the plight of the Palisades, and I am calling on the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| council to recognize the plight of the Palisades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| and to recognize the plight of the Palestinian people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| Ms. Fung, this is not your main year out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| If you don't stick to the topic at hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| I'm going to have to ask you to leave the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| So I ask you all to call for a permanent ceasefire resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3738)|

| 1:03:10| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3790)|

| 1:03:15| And you have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3795)|

| 1:03:20| is this grant about community traffic safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| Yeah, I'm Lilith Sweeney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3806)|

| 1:03:31| I've actually met a lot of y'all before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| I've been doing work with the city on the eviction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| prevention program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| Big fan of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| But yeah, good to see y'all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| Before I get too deep, could someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| elaborate on the rules of what's allowed a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| Is there like a written something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| Yes, according to Robert's rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| which are the rules of city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| have adopted to keep their council meetings going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| require that any discussion on an agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| be germane to that topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| And germane means about the topic, not about other topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| So this topic is, as you may have read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| Tennessee Highway Safety Office grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| with no local match required to provide enhanced community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| traffic safety education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| So that's what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| You can speak on those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| But it's not about foreign affairs or other matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| That's what it's, it's very plain language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Yeah, well, I was supposed to be down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| that I'm in favor of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| I think some of y'all might have heard what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| in the old city a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| A young woman was hit by a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| Some of the conditions down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| are just like really intense at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| If you're there on a Thursday night, a Friday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| or a Saturday night, there are people spilling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| into the streets with drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| So I don't know if this program really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| can do anything for like fewer drunk drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| maybe like moving some roots around or like things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| But I'm definitely in favor of this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| It's one of those things that like pedestrians just really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| do have the right of way most of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| except at lights and like a few other sparing circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| It's something that was used to great effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| Where was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| It was in Rafa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| There was a picket by Israelis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| And they weren't allowed to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| Please keep it local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| That was about all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3929)|

| 1:06:11| Council members, one person has signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| to speak in opposition to this pedestrian safety grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| Miss Madison Fung, please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| And again, you are aware that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| supposed to speak on the agenda item at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| So I've already talked about how important I think public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3991)|
| 1:06:31| And I am certainly not against this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| in the traditional form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| Frankly, I'm against it because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| don't think it's enough money that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| is going to be sent to the state of Tennessee Highway Safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| Office to provide overtime funding for a pedestrian safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Knoxville is a tourist town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| It is a college town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| And yet, only very select portions of it are walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| I live in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| And it's basically a food desert there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| It's impossible to walk anywhere and get your groceries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| and be able to walk home and back because of the conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| whether it be that our sidewalks are underfunded and broken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| or there are no sidewalks at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| So as a tourist town, we want to not only showcase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| just our downtown and our college campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| but also the entire town itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| Because what is Knoxville if it's not downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| It's people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| And that's what Knoxville is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Knoxville is people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| So like I said, we should be funding these pedestrian safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| campaigns even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| We should be funding driver safety campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| We're maybe not policing them more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| but providing better education on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| to be safe around pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| We should be providing more information and resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| for drivers who are trying to make their way downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| so that we can try to be safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| Because I know for me, I door dash for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| I'm in my car all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| And I hate going downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| And I hate going down to the strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| because it is so stressful driving there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| not only because of the traffic, but because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| of all of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| And it's not a people problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| It's a problem that our infrastructure is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| set up correctly to be able to account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| for the amount of traffic that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| and the amount of people that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| So I'm against this resolution simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| because I don't think it's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| And I think there should be more funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4125)|
| 1:08:45| Council members, that concludes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| People signed up to speak to item 11E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| Council member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| Yeah, I just, there's several of these grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| that are THSO that are relevant to safety programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| Have we applied for these before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| Are they new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| Have we received them before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Chief Noel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| These are all grants that we've previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| applied for before and been awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| OK, so they would just be continuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| OK, any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| Seeing none, all those in favor, oh, council member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4158)|
| 1:09:30| How will this program and these efforts tie into the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4170)|
| 1:09:39| oh, now I'm forgetting what it's called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4179)|
| 1:09:47| the Zero Pedestrian Deaths Campaign that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| Vision Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| How will this work tie into the Vision Zero campaign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| Thank you for your question, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| This is very much consistent with our Vision Zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| And it will be aligned with that fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| Because I'm starting to see statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| like in this packet, it says our traffic fatalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4213)|
| 1:10:21| are increasing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| And so we are potentially able to pursue these funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4222)|
| 1:10:33| opportunities to address some of those traffic fatalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| But what I would like to get a better sense of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| is where they are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| A few months ago, the KPD released some numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| about traffic fatalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| And in 2023, it looks like there were 45 people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4251)|
| 1:10:59| died in traffic crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| And of those 45, 10 were pedestrian fatalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| And it does seem that we are largely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| focused on the pedestrian fatalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| and preventing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| And I would like to get a better sense of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| were the causes of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| Were these on state highways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| Were these in neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| Were these interstates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| Were these, I've seen some pedestrian fatalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| along the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| But it would be good for us to have a sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| that since we have this commitment as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| this Vision Zero commitment, to have a better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| of how traffic fatalities, and specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| pedestrian fatalities, are occurring in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| Our Vision Zero plan does identify the parts of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| that have had the most pedestrian fatalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| and other kinds of fatalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| They do happen to be often on state routes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| such as Magnolia, and Chapman, and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| And so perhaps council would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| to have a workshop to learn more about the Vision Zero plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| and share some insights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| We just, I just appointed Cody Gentry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| to be our Vision Zero coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| And if council wishes, we could definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| have a workshop on that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4366)|

| 1:12:53| 11F is the resolution authorizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4373)|

| 1:13:37| Yeah, I'm Madison Fung.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| Fung, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| It's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4421)|
| 1:13:41| I'm District 2, South, or I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| District 1, South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| Despite how committed I am to public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| I am extremely against expanding our police presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| across the city under this pretext.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| Our police department is plagued with corruption and vileness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| from a shooting an innocent black kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| to dragging a woman out of the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| and allowing her to die on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| I do not care under what pretext this, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| purchase of safety, traffic safety equipment, unquote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| happens to be under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| It's only going to be used to surveil us more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| This exact thing is happening in Palestine right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| The idea is using the state-of-the-art tracking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| equipment to Palestinians on the outskirts of Palestine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| I will rule you out of order if you don't keep it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| to the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4466)|
| 1:14:26| They are using it to enforce their apartheid state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| Ms. Fung, I ask that you please keep this to the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| It's not germane what is happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| across the other side of the planet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Please keep it to the local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| I am going to wrap this back over to Knoxville, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| Keep it local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| It is a local issue, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| The surveillance state that we were all warned against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4481)|
| 1:14:50| is already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| Did you know that the IDF gets all of their police training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| and training tactics from right here in the United States?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| I'm sure that we are all aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| Did you know that the IDF gets all of their training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| from here in the United States?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| Keep it germane to the topic, or I'll ask you to step down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| I apologize, ma'am, but this is a local issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| Keep it germane to the topic, which is about the purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4512)|
| 1:15:24| of traffic safety equipment in Knoxville and overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| costs to enforce impaired, distracted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| or aggressive driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| That's what the topic is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| It is not about what's going on in other countries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| So this is about surveillance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| We can all agree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| This is about surveilling drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| tracking them across the city, seeing what is going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| who's doing what, who's doing what where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| And I'm trying to tell you that this is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| is not only a Knoxville issue, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| means that we should be more concerned about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| than we already are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| That's what my point is, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| So how can we ensure that these same crimes will eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| not be committed against us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| I mean, they already are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| The disproportionate amount of violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| against our black community proves this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| This is one more thing that we as Knoxvillians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| have in common with Palestinians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| We are facing the same violence, though at this exact moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| not the same extent as the Palestinian people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| This should drive us to not only prevent these crimes at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| but also abroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| We should be able to see where our struggles align| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| and where we reach across international borders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| and say we stand with you and with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| against violence in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Ms. Funk, please keep it to the item at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| That's not your main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| We must stand with each other to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| that violence is not only discontinued, but eradicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| from our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| So I am asking you, as the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| to vote against this police state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| to vote against this surveillance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| and to stand with your community who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| is asking for a lesser in violence against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| Council members, that concludes the people signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| to speak to item 11F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| Council member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| I just wanted to make a comment about what I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| we're actually voting on, which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| are we going to allow you to apply for a grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| And if awarded, take that money to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4640)|
| 1:17:27| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4649)|
| 1:17:29| I am for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| Look forward to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| Do you want me to raise my hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| Yes, I didn't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| You had to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| Since the issue was raised, could the chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| please go through what traffic safety equipment is planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| to be purchased with this grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| So if we are awarded this grant after we apply for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| we will have the opportunity to purchase different traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| safety equipment, such as radar and LIDAR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| which we use to enforce traffic laws, traffic cones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| reflective vests, and a variety of other supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| that we use to conduct traffic investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| When there is, and we don't have true transparency in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| when it comes to understanding what surveillance equipment is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| being purchased and being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| And I do plan to bring an ordinance before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| to adopt some of that transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| But some of the concerns that have been raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| are real concerns that I have as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| We are learning from other jurisdictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| not only around the country, but around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| And we've just had a mayor who went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| to learn some things from Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| We still don't know the details of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| I'm very concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| By no doubt, I'm very concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| Every human rights organization in the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| this is a topic of conversation of what other cities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| learning from Israel, especially when we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| about a surveillance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| So I'm very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| And whenever we have an agenda item that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| might include some sort of equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| I want to know whether it's going to be used to surveil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| And part of the reason behind that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| is because once you start researching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| a lot of these surveillance equipment companies, a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| them are data mining companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| They're not producing products that necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4790)|

| 1:19:56| but they collect data and they sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| And then that does pose a threat to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| It does make us less safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| So I have some very real questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4805)|

| 1:20:09| who have very real questions about what equipment is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| bought, how it's being used, how are we regulating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| And I'll tell you, we're not currently regulating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4815)|

| 1:21:27| to enhance law enforcement mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4887)|

| 1:21:35| It's me again, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| Something that I think would be really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| is these kinds of services being spread out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| to maybe a lot of different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| Of course, the fire department is the most natural one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| But also just in general, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| like a lot of mental health problems going on in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| We could do things, alternative response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| other things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| $200,000, not that much money having looked at these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| And I do kind of hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| But yeah, that could be a great start on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| and using the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| I know that was something that got put forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| with earlier alternative response programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| A lot of people, yeah, they just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| have a lot of hope here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| We've got a lot of things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| There's the higher amount of housing occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| than other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| We've got just a high amount of traffic deaths and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| And then genocides in the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| And it's like, what are we supposed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| So I would like to see services like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| be expanded and used more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| Thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| Council, that concludes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4971)|

| 1:23:03| 11H's resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| to execute an agreement with Design and Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4985)|

| 1:23:14| in order to add a third compactor at the solid waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| transfer facility located at 1033 Elm Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| Council members, there's one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| signed up to speak in opposition to this, Madison Funk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5007)|
| 1:23:35| You have up to five minutes to address council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| about your concerns about item 11H, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| is about adding a third compactor, a wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| to allow us to add a compactor at the solid waste transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| So I'm not going to stand up here and pretend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| that I know exactly what a solid waste transfer facility does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5033)|
| 1:23:59| but I am going to address my concerns about expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| this facility in one of the most disenfranchised parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| As we all know, a majority of our black population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| has been pushed into East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| whether that be by redlining or simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| because it's where more people who are poor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| can continue to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| With the effects of redlining, East Knoxville has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| I'm sorry, that was the wrong point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| So of course, we would locate all of our waste management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| to be there as well, because we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| to keep the rich, nice, white parts of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| all nice and clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| And you know, it's just racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| And so I'm concerned about what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| will mean for our brothers and sisters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| in that part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| This resolution only speaks to a much larger issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| in Knoxville, which is the disenfranchisement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| of our minority communities, from the black community being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| pushed eastward to the silencing of Palestinian voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| We cannot allow these voices to be silenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| yet you are allowing them to be, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| is something that stands against my moral values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| and moral values of many, many other people in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| So in the end, I would like to know more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| about what is happening to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| in this area of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| I want to know why we have decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| that this is where our city's waste management is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| to be held and why it cannot be spread over parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| I want to know why we have decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| that we are going to allow to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| the disenfranchisement of these minority voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5140)|

| 1:26:49| as prepared by the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5209)|

| 1:26:56| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| Council members, there are two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| signed up to speak in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| First is Junot Murray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| Junot Murray, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| Nope, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| Next person is Lilith Sweeney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| Lilith Sweeney, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| Okay, that concludes the people who signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| Lilith Sweeney, please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| You have up to five minutes to address council on item 12B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5243)|
| 1:27:29| one-year plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| Did we skip 11J?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| Is that what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5254)|
| 1:27:34| Those were passed on the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| so they were already passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| I was earlier in the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| part of the planning process for the people's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| And so I'm out here to kind of oppose this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| on the fact that like a lot of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| that we did want in were not put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| things like alternative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| or a full right to counsel on eviction court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| This is item 12B, not that the budget one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| was already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| This is the one on the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| You didn't sign up to speak to 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| I thought the budget would be a part of the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| so is this for more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| Is this more like zoning or that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| Land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| It's land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| Land use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| Land use, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5306)|
| 1:28:26| Oh, word, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| Cool, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| That concludes the people who signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| to speak to item 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| Council members, any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| Council member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| Yes, I have some questions for Ms. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| but before I dive into those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| I would like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| I made the motion to approve this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| I would like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| to remove the RN3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| from the low density residential land use table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| Okay, motion has been made to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| a motion to amend has been made to remove RN3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| from the low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| From the land use table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| From the land use table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5358)|
| 1:29:18| Land classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| Okay, that motion to amend has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Council member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| Can I make a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5368)|
| 1:29:28| There's actually several points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| there's several places where what you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| Council member Ryder, appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| I was gonna suggest that on page 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| we remove RN3 under subsection permitting zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| Returning that section to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| areas should be zoned A, G, E, N,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| RN1 and RN2 as appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| and provided for under the Knoxville zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| Would that be an okay addition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| I think that was the intent of the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| but I just wanted to be real specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| about where we're taking out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5400)|
| 1:30:06| Yeah, so it's basically reversing the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| that was made by Shelso and seconded by Higgins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| at the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| And then the second one, there's only three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| The second one was page 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| removing RN3 under subsection permitted zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| and the second bullet point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| and returning that bullet point to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| RN1 and RN2 may also be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| Again, that's just returning the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| to what was before the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| that was brought by the members of planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| Okay, and then the last one is on page 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| It says RN3, I wanna remove RN3 from LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| which is low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| returning the permitted zones to A, G, E, N,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| RN1 and RN2 and I think that encompasses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| all of the places that you were referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| Yes, it was just stated much simpler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| at the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| Okay, I'm a little confused about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| where we are in the amendment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| Does everyone, I mean, do you wanna try to clarify this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| What I was saying was it's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| my interpretation of the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| was that these are friendly amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| just to be very specific about what we're taking out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| and so that's what I put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| What I understood was Council Member Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| accepted those as friendly amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| so that becomes the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| and that's what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| Yeah, so Council Member Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| you're basically reversing what's on page 264| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| in our package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| Does that help you, Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| Ms. Brooks, it was much simpler stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| at the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| because I watched it last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| My memory's not that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| Amy Brooks, Knox-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| What was, maybe a little bit of clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| on what was more simply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| in terms of the commissioners did vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| on adding RN3 to LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| Is that what you're speaking to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| Specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| And they made a very simple motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| to add RN3 to the LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| And so rather than me just saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| Council Member Roberto is suggesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| that we say all of what's on page 264 in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| So I just am being clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| Sorry, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| He's just being clear, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| And that is included in your AIS sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| In the back it talks about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| on that second page, at their March 7th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| This was the specific edits that would need to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| in order to incorporate their requested amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5568)|
| 1:32:49| Which was simply stated as adding RN3 to the LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| So we'll go with Roberto's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| It's a friendly second, I will do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| So the friendly second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| So the friendly amendment has been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| by Council Member Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| seconded by Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| Does everyone understand what the amendment is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| All those in favor of this amendment, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| Motion carries 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| Motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| Now back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| Further discussion, Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| So Ms. Brooks, to maybe be a little clearer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| about what we just voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| I'm gonna maybe hopefully summarize pretty quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| and maybe you can tell me if I'm right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| So for everyone's understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| the one-year plan is one of the basises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| for our land use and our zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| And each year by our code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| you guys put forth the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| Ms. Hillman, I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| I didn't get to watch all of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| but that is a recorded meeting that people could watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| and should watch and people participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| You guys did not recommend the land use classification table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| to be changed to include R and 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| in the one-year plan this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| but it was added by motion at the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| And what I would like to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| and my intent behind supporting this motion to remove it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| is what I, because I'd like to be clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| because all my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| and I may not be on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| I would like to ask that you and your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| look at the rationale for why Shelso and Huber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| and others made this motion to move that R and 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| to the land use classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| And if that is something that is deemed necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5688)|
| 1:34:54| include it in the next year's one-year planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| and inform council where the discrepancies and issues occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| that warranted that motion to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| Yes, we can take a deeper dive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| Yes, I would like a deeper dive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| I would like explicit examples for my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| So when we transition from the old zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| to the new zoning code under recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| there are some uses that were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| there's some divergence in what R1A and R3 and RN3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5729)|
| 1:35:35| it got commingled and divided in multiple ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| So some of the uses that were allowed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| that are currently allowed or currently are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| are in 3 were in low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| were and are allowed in the same places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| that were low density residential prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| And the way that we have changed things with recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| and the land classification tables now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| there are some things that just don't line up correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5762)|
| 1:36:09| One thing that I'll say is Ms. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| the current RN3 allows for fraternities and sororities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5771)|
| 1:36:19| as well as independent living in the use code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| in the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| They're allowed after a special use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| Okay, but those things are not allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| in the other low density residential zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| like RN1, RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| Okay, and the uses that fall under the current RN3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5798)|
| 1:36:45| that used to be low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| it's like things are commingled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| Am I making sense to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| And maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| So what we've done by not putting some of those same uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| because we don't have R1A anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| We bifurcated some of the R1A uses to RN3 and RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| So we've made this quandary where some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| that used to be R1A that were low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| are now being treated as medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| because they got lumped in the pot of RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| So why I am supporting this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| is so that the staff will go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| and hopefully come back in the next one year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| and resolve some of that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| and we can make people not have to go get rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| for the fact that they are in the low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| residential part of the RN3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| not to allow sororities, fraternities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| and independent living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| within our single family neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| which was the concern that was raised by our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| Ms. Brooks, the conversation we had earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| the reason that I was not in favor of the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| and I wanna make sure that I have it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| is by including this into the low density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| it's actually enabling us to tweak slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| the ability to provide a little bit more housing variety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| in more areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| Potentially, so in RN3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| townhomes are allowed as a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| under the special use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| So it's not by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| but yes, it introduces a new housing type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| into the low density residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| And from what Ms. Ryder's asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| she's just saying, look at that again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| and we're gonna be doing that very soon anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5929)|
| 1:38:55| Redoing the, looking at the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| Yes, well, we only update the one year plan once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| I think the request is, hey, over this next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| take a closer look at RN3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| and provide some additional analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| of where those inconsistencies are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| what the issues are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| and come back with a more refined proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| Commissioner, I mean, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| I support removing all of it because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| and you can look at it for another year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| but the fact that this just came out of the blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| at a planning commission meeting with no public discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| we were surprised by it on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| I don't appreciate being surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| about a big zoning thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| And that's just not the right way to do business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| when you're talking about zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| which concerns people's most expensive investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| they ever make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| We went through a lot of angst going through middle housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6001)|
| 1:40:06| making sure people really understood it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| before we made zoning changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| And things have gotten very confusing after recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| And I understand we're trying to clarify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| but clarifying it by a motion, a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| and a vote at a planning commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| and coming to this body as a change in the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| with no public discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| is not a good way to do business, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| So I appreciate that planning staff didn't recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| And I think if it's going to come through again next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| it needs to be fully vetted and recommended by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| I understand that planning commission's job is land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6046)|
| 1:40:52| Ours is also to represent the constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| that own the land that is being rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| So we kind of have different roles to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| And so I can understand why they felt comfortable with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| but when we're getting blown up by people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| who are like, where did this come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| We don't know anything about it, and it doesn't feel good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| I appreciate the pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| Council Member Thomas and then Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| Yeah, I just want to be very succinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| I would underline everything that Councilperson Fugate said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| and that was the reaction I was getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| from my constituents as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| And for the same reasons, this is really complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| I myself just got the packet Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| and to be able to go through all this and the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| and why we're doing what and the unintended consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| it's impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| So thank you for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| I just want to concur with my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| You know, I think that we all appreciate the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| that planning commissioners do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| but in this particular instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| we really need to be giving people notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| about what's going on and an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| to participate in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| Specifically, the issues that I saw with regard to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| are that this would create confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| and some contradictions that would make it very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| for people to understand exactly what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| Specifically, the purpose statement in R and three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| talks about the intent is to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| medium density residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| Putting that into a category that's categorized low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| You're then adding low and medium in the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| That's not to say there might not be some changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| to look at, and so I agree with what my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| have said as well, but those terminologies don't mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| Also, when you look at the land classification chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| when you're thinking about the levels of density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| low is six or fewer dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| and medium is six to 24 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| Again, there's a contradiction there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| if you put something that's intended for medium into low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| So that was specifically some of the issues that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6196)|
| 1:43:22| I do know that staff has recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| making this change before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| and we've definitely heard conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| from planning commissioners about this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| but my suggestion would be that if we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| to redefine the densities and uses in LDR and MDR and HDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6216)|
| 1:43:43| which is low, medium, and high density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| we need to go back through the text of all the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| because they're all coming from the general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| the sector, and the one-year plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| We really need to look at the text of each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| If staff thinks that we need to review the maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| to identify areas that should go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| from low density to medium density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| I think we can do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| That might not necessarily make us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| have to change the definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6248)|
| 1:44:09| but we could then look at the maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| and I think we should do those in a standalone way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| as opposed to doing it when it's in the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| I do think that more study is needed in all of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| but I think there's a way of doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| so that we can make sure that everyone's aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| of the changes that are being made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| and they can participate in the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| And so that would be my recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| if in looking at this you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| it's a good idea to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| Any other, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6281)|
| 1:44:42| I hear what my colleagues are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| the confusion, and I hear the points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| I think I want to remain the outlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| because I keep on trying to push and push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| for less restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| But I do like what Council Member Roberto said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| about looking at the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| and making some of these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| That makes practical sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| Seeing none, all those in favor of this motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| as amended, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6311)|

| 1:46:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6382)|
| 1:46:22| Next we have a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| First person signed up to speak is Vivian Scheib.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| Ms. Scheib.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6387)|
| 1:46:45| Vivian Scheib, 3615 MLK, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6405)|
| 1:46:52| I'm coming before you, first of all, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| My question is why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| I want to know why we failed to save the foyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| You see, we've got to start thinking outside of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| We've got to start thinking outside of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| And grants is not the way to do everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| One of the statements that they made was they decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| they had to close the foyer because of the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| to get grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6442)|
| 1:47:22| That's not their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| It is our responsibility to take care of the least of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6444)|
| 1:47:31| And we don't have to reinvent the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| There are organizations in Knoxville that have been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| this kind of work, helping the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| sheltering for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| Connect Ministry's been doing it almost 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| We don't have to go out and try to find grant money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| and we should not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| Taking care of the homeless should be part of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| It should be a recurring line item in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| So, I come before you not only just to bring that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| but to bring you some suggestions and some ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| some think outside the box ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| So, my suggestion number one is I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| Connect Ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| Why don't you turn that building over to them and why don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| you let them be the umbrella for Care Cuts Ministry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| which is another organization that has been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| with Connect for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| When she first started, she came to Connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| That's how she knows what to do because she came to Connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| and she talked to them about how do we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| So, this is a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| And when you do that, don't just turn the building over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| go over there and get some of that money out of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| rainy day fund that's just sitting there collecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| interest, millions of dollars, sitting there making us money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| but we're not doing anything to help the least of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| So, now you got opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| You let it close, it's closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| So, my idea is when you reopen the doors, think a new way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| So, you don't have to eat an elephant all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| You eat an elephant a piece at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| So, let's do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| You have a gun, you need to reopen that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| Turn it over to somebody, put money behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| We didn't have no problem putting up $75 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| for a stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| We don't have any problem sitting inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| I remember we set aside $14 million for a stadium floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| that's not going to be open for two years, but we set it aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| Now, we got to, we're talking about 25 million to build a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| bridge from South Knoxville over here so we can party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| down on Naland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| I asked you about the $6 million when you didn't get the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| Can you give that to the homeless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| Can you give that to the homeless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| No, because we're going to get that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| And you're going to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| But in the meantime, you got to answer to a higher power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| You got to take care of the least of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| This is not what's, this is what's not being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| So, let's take it, let's bite it out a piece at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| So, when we reopen the foyer, let's take care of the elders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| Do you know that if you check with the census that every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| single day, every day, 10,000 people in America turned 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6595)|
| 1:50:01| That's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| So, what you got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6603)|
| 1:50:03| Now, you got 65 and up over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| You got 18 and under over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| You got an abortion law that keeps people from having their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| rights because you want to make babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| Nobody's stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| No one is stupid in this country, but it's time for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| to be accountable for the least of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| And we got to talk about it, and we got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| So, when you open those doors, here's a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| Open it back up, and let's take care of the seniors and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| the elders, like the man that was sitting on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| He was old in his wheelchair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| Nobody take care of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| So, let's make the first bite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| OK, let's open the foyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| Let's take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6637)|
| 1:50:38| You got to take care of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6638)|
| 1:50:42| So, let's start with the seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| Let's take this, and let's open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| OK, we're going to take care of the seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| Now, now that you know that there's 65 people, 10,000 65| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| year olds every year, let's go get some of these other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6653)|
| 1:50:53| Let's get some empty properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| Let's take that money out of this that's just sitting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| making us money, and start taking care of our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| Tonight, you can lay at your feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| When that tornado, and I'm praying, Lord, no, let us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| pass it by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| Because when you lock the doors, you put those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| on the street, where are they going to be tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| Where are they going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| Where are they going to shelter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| We got to do better now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6679)|
| 1:51:23| OK, next person signed up to speak is Tom Ruggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| Tom Ruggles, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| OK, next person is Juno Murray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| Juno Murray, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| OK, next person is Madison Funk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6696)|
| 1:51:42| You have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6702)|
| 1:51:46| Before my time starts, I have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| on how to conduct this public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| Are we allowed to speak on whatever we want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| OK, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| So in that case, I would like to bring to the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| a little bit of education as soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| as I can get my phone open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6720)|

| 1:52:04| All right, so this is something that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| wrote for a speech that I was going to give that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| unfortunately, was canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| So I'm going to give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| Lately, I have been consumed by grief and rage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| because of the ongoing Palestinian genocide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| I'm consumed by grief at the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| whenever I open up Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| I just see genocide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| I see dead Palestinian babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6747)|

| 1:52:40| that we are witnessing firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| It's not the first time this has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| Israel's current attitude of ignoring international community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| is not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| In fact, it is an established pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| of callousness and depravity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| So let's talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| Now, Israeli settlers started entering Palestine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| in the late 1800s, forcefully taking their lands and homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| displacing thousands of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| There was an uprising known as the Arab Revolt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| that was squashed by the might of the British Empire in 1939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6788)|
| 1:53:13| 2,000 Palestinian homes were destroyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| and 9,000 Palestinians were put into concentration camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| The Nakba had started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| For those of you who don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| al-Nakba means the catastrophe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| Let that sink in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| Officially, al-Nakba is dated as May 15th, 1947.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| During this time, 750,000 Palestinians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6819)|
| 1:53:44| were forcibly displaced from their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| and over 15,000 were killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| That is half of how many have been killed in Gaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| in the last five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| The village of Deir Yassin, this violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| was especially depraved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| Over a thousand...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| I'm sorry, over 100 people were killed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| in the most brutal of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| spanning from being burned alive, tied to olive trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| or lined against a wall and shot with shoved machine guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| Most of these fatalities were women, children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| and elderly people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| The fact that this village had signed a non-aggression pact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| with the Israelis makes this especially more heinous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| And this is not the only village that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| This is not the only village that these atrocities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| took place in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| The people of Haifa, Yachfa, West Jerusalem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6878)|
| 1:54:42| Bessan, and Akra were also subjected to this brutality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| This is all in the name of ensuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| that the colonial imperialist state of Israel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| had land to spread its poison on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| While it's extremely important to talk about the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| of brutal colonization that the Palestinians have faced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| we must also talk about how Israel continues this pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| in more recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| I'm going to simply give you a rapid-fire list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| of what they have done to help their enormous list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6910)|

| 1:55:21| with targeting civilian infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| This accusation goes unignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6923)|

| 1:55:30| The United Nations charges Israel with the following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| collective punishment, disproportionate force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| against civilians, which resulted in the death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| of hundreds of civilians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| Despite IDF propaganda, IDF soldiers say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6939)|
| 1:55:43| they were instructed to shoot indiscriminately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| and to cleanse houses and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| Human shields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6948)|

| 1:55:52| They even used children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| There was an 11-year-old boy who was used as cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6954)|

| 1:56:09| and started a devastating fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| The IDF tries to excuse this as a smokescreen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6972)|
| 1:56:16| Any of this sounding familiar yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=6976)|

| 1:56:47| between civilians and Hamas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| because Hamas were in civilian clothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| Sound familiar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| This is what started the Hamas using human shields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7014)|

| 1:58:05| with someone from KCDC upper management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| to show me where I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| I have went through HUD policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7090)|
| 1:58:14| over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| I haven't found nowhere where we can force these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| to either sign a promissory note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| or be evicted from their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| It is impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| This has been going on for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| We first went to the board at KCDC and they pushed us off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7111)|
| 1:58:38| We went back to our upper management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| They pushed us off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7121)|

| 1:59:14| by telling these people not to pay their rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| so they could collect money from ERA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7157)|

| 2:01:09| and I'm speaking out about this bogus promissory note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7269)|
| 2:01:14| but we are kicking people out on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7274)|

| 2:01:42| that they're having people to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7302)|

| 2:01:47| or the week before I was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7307)|

| 2:01:54| for her and her three kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7314)|

| 2:02:04| for six months to maintain her housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7324)|
| 2:02:07| And if $251 is 30% of her income, what is 771%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7327)|
| 2:02:15| That's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7335)|
