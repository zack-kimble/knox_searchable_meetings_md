| 0:06:09| Since that's the only application we have today, I wanted to see if we could get a brief update on Okie Joes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=369)|
| 0:06:19| I was contacted by someone who is supposed to be applying for Okie Joes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=379)|
| 0:06:27| According to this person, they are not going to keep their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| And we have the permit. Wolfie picked up the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| So there's nothing to surrender at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| But she hasn't turned in the application yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| But the deadline is not here yet for the March agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| So they're changing ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| From what I was told, I was not told that by Mr. Getty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| It was someone talking about applying for the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Has codes or fire heard from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| Last week, a couple came into our office with some building plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| and asked what they were needing to do as far as the application process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| or at least what they needed to do with the deck that was there that they built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| And I let them know that they would need to either have, since we did not inspect it and it's completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| they would need to have an engineer submit a letter that it is built per code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| or they would need to remove the deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| And that's the last interaction our office has had with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| Fire prevention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| From my understanding, they have met with the deputy fire marshal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| and are going to proceed with opening the bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=460)|
| 0:07:48| and their plans are to sprinkle the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| That was the last conversation that the deputy fire marshal had with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| This was the new people or the old people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| Is this the new people or the current owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| It's the new people that Sean spoke with as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Is there any other business before this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| I just had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| So the business is completely shut down at this point then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| Any other business before this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=503)|

| 0:09:09| We're doing the devotional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| We're doing the devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| I know it's backwards on the agenda, but I'm doing the devotional, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| So we'll bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| Heavenly Father, we come before this commission today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| and our hearts are heavy by what happened in Florida and Broward County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| And we ask that as we keep that in mind, our prayers be with the families there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=570)|
| 0:09:38| that have been so deeply touched and destroyed, some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=578)|
| 0:09:45| And just, dear God, we pray that you would be with those families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| and the schools there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| And I pray that you would help us in this county to make good decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=591)|
| 0:09:58| that will keep our children safe, that will keep our county safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| As we come before you today and we make decisions that affect our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| that we all make good decisions that will lead this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| in the direction we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| We just really pray for your blessing on this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| and, again, for all those folks in Florida| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| that have had such a terrible tragedy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| We pray all these things in Jesus' name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| Everyone, please remain standing and salute our pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| Attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| Salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| Pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=650)|
| 0:11:00| Before we get started, I'd like to recognize some people in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| We have some students here from Lincoln Memorial University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| Martin Sellers is here with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Would you all stand up, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=669)|
| 0:11:18| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| Commissioner Nystrom, would you like to recognize some young men?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| It's my pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Many of my fellow commissioners, you've heard me talk about scout activities here at commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| and it's my pleasure to actually introduce Troop 757 from the Toqua District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=694)|
| 0:11:42| It's my pleasure to serve as their assistant scoutmaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| and for many of these scouts I was their cubmaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| and I've had the chance to work with them on community service and leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| ever since they were in second grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| So tonight they're here to attend their first county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| They're also working on the Citizenship and the Community Merit Badge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| which is an EGLE requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| and one of those requirements requires them to attend a community public meeting such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| So I'm pleased to have them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| At our last month's meeting, Channing McCollum was elected by these boys to be their patrol leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=735)|
| 0:12:23| So what I'm going to do is I'm going to ask all of them to come down to the front behind the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| and I'll meet you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Then I'm going to give Channing an opportunity to address county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| and then I guess we'll get a quick picture so you guys can prove it to your merit badge counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| Does that sound like a pretty good idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| Okay. All right, boys, just meet me down here at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=762)|
| 0:13:06| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| Just say Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| Just say your name, Knoxville, Tennessee, for the record, and then you can address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| I'm Channing McCollum from Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| and we're so happy that you could invite us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| We're working on the Citizenship and the Community Merit Badge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| and we thank you for all the work you do for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=813)|
| 0:14:04| One, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=844)|
| 0:14:19| Hey, follow me on Twitter. I'll just put that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=859)|
| 0:14:37| I would also like to acknowledge the presence of the Honorable Mayor Tim Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=877)|
| 0:14:46| Madam Clerk, we're at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| First speaker is Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| My name is Barbara Cook, 4221 Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| I'm here this evening to read into the record the e-mail that I sent you folks last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| It's the same old song.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| In explaining his double bogey on the 18th hole of the first round of the Honda Classic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, Rory McIlroy offered the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=923)|
| 0:15:29| Well, it was a great shot, I just didn't execute it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| Attached with this e-mail are the operating procedures from Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| for the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| A review of these procedures should lead anyone who thought that a jail diversion facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| was just what was needed in Knoxville to a similar conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| Well, a great idea, it's just not being executed properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| What was supposed to be a jail diversion facility for those with mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| has morphed into a wing in an expensive, expansive building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| financed by the city, the county, and the state so that Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| can expand their crisis stabilization treatment facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| Facilities that will allow access and egress by the general public mixed in with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| and treated by the same staff as those who have encountered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| and been transported by law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| Presumably police and sheriff's department personnel have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| and are being given crisis intervention training to assist them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| in recognizing candidates eligible for jail diversion in this wing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1008)|
| 0:16:55| There is no indication that those employed at this facility have been given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| any training in managing patients who are confined, as if in jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| until successfully completing the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| This is just one of the many questions that concerned neighbors have raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| after having reviewed the proposed procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| Those questions are also attached to this email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| The Knoxville Office of Neighborhoods has agreed to set up a meeting between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| principal players involved with the BHUCC and community leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| as soon as possible, given their schedule and staffing constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| We thank them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| However, this facility is slated to open as early as March 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| with many important safety issues still not addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| Two of the primary players responsible for the existence of this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| in its present location and form are term limited and are moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1080)|
| 0:18:08| The rest of you are still here and have a job to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| and a responsibility to citizens and taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| Rory McIlroy headed back to the driving range and practice round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| to work hard and do all he can to improve his game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| so that he can properly execute those very important golf shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| What, if I may be so bold to ask, what are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| I just want to let you know that, from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| on tomorrow's city council, there is a resolution requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| that the Knoxville mayor execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| to apply for and accept a five-year law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| and behavioral health partnership for early diversion grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| in the amount of $1,233,750, with a required local match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| in the amount of $416,250 for a total grant amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| of $1,650,000 to expand programs that divert adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1166)|

| 0:19:44| prior to arrest and booking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| The Knoxville Police Department is gearing up to send a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| into that wing that we have paid so much money for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| a wing that we have no idea whether the people who are working there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| have any training whatsoever to operate. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| Thank you, ma'am. Next up is Jack Whittle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1210)|
| 0:20:20| Sir, it's my understanding that you want to address item number 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1220)|
| 0:20:29| Would you like to wait until then to address it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| I would prefer to do that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| Okay, sir. I'll call you back up then. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| Next up is Memorializing Jim Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1244)|

| 0:22:08| but soon realized the need for care was great in the United States and particularly in Appalachia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| And whereas in 1992, Mr. Brock organized the first stateside RAM clinic in Hancock County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1334)|
| 0:22:22| where there hadn't been a dentist for two years and the only hospital had closed its doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| And when he arrived at the clinic site, there were more than 50 patients already waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| when he had only expected to treat a few patients that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| Whereas the following year, RAM operated eight mobile clinics in East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| and has grown tremendously over the years since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| And whereas today remote area medical provides medical care through free mobile clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| and isolated or impoverished communities, and most clinics provide general medical, dental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| vision, preventive care and education, and some clinics also provide veterinarian services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| And whereas since 1985, Stan Brock has mobilized more than 120,000 humanitarian volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| comprised of licensed dental, vision, veterinary and medical professions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| who have treated more than 740,000 individuals and 67,000 animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| delivering $120 million worth of free health care services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| Whereas RAM recently marked its 900th mobile clinic with a five-day clinic event in Knoxville, its home base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| And whereas Stan Brock has also worked over the years to change state laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| to allow medical professionals from other states to volunteer at RAM clinics in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| along with 11 other states have passed such legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| Whereas in addition, remote area medical's disaster relief arm reaches around the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| and through partnerships with global organizations and thanks to international volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| RAM is able to respond to disasters, deliver medical relief and other humanitarian aid when needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1439)|
| 0:24:06| And whereas RAM is funded through donations and relies on volunteers from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| as well as professionals including physicians, dentists, optometrists, nurses, pilots and veterinarians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| to provide care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| And whereas the commission desires to thank Stan Brock, founder and president of the remote area medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| and commend RAM's work in providing free medical care to those who cannot afford it in our community and country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| and also providing disaster relief on an international scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| Now therefore be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| Honors and applause Stan Brock and the life giving work of remote area medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to Stan Brock, founder and president of remote area medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| as provided by the charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1505)|
| 0:25:28| Well thank you very much for this very warm greeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| and this great honor that you have bestowed upon the 120 odd thousand volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1533)|
| 0:25:42| of remote area medical that have served the people of this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1542)|
| 0:25:48| and being based here in Knoxville, Tennessee for the last 34 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| In fact I would also like to introduce our longest serving volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1555)|
| 0:26:03| Bill Wilson who has served this organization wonderfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1563)|
| 0:26:12| for the last 27 years and I think our CEO Jeff Eastman would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| that she's really keeping everybody straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| And I suppose it's about 25 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1586)|
| 0:26:34| that this same August body, the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| granted us the Giffin Elementary School as our headquarters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| and we were based in the Giffin Elementary School for 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| for a dollar a year rent and I believe that we may still be behind on the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| But it was just what we needed to get this organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1620)|
| 0:27:08| which had been struggling along for some 10 or 15 years a base of operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| and in fact we would still be at the Giffin Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| except that it started to have some difficulties with the actual structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| and in fact Mayor Bouchette said to me one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| he said I want to give you this building and I said well thank you very much Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| but I think perhaps we'll pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1655)|
| 0:27:45| A couple of weeks ago we held our 900th event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| which happened to fall here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| and we saw some 2,684 patients I believe it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| and so 900 expeditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1682)|
| 0:28:09| I'm sure we'll be here for the 1,000th expedition probably sometime next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| because we are running about 70 of these operations a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| Wonderful to see these young fellows from the scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| Last year we had a big scout jamboree at our Ram Ranger Youth Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| out not too far from here and I think some of you boys were probably there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| I know that there were 2,500 scouts there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1716)|
| 0:28:44| and so our youth program is always open to young folks, boys and girls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| and give us a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| We'd love to have groups out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| Thank you very much indeed for this honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1742)|
| 0:29:17| Mr. Brock, I have always been a great admirer of you and your organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| and I think there are saints and angels that walk amongst us here on earth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| and your volunteers as some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| Growing up in the 70s there wasn't a Sunday I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| There was two things that went on at my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| We went to church and we watched Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| If you young people want to see a man's man, you get on YouTube, you type in Stan Brock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| He was a hundra barefooted in a horse and wrestled that thing to the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| and they asked where's Marlon Perkins and he's over there checking the oil in the helicopter or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| I don't know, but you were always, Stan, you are the man and I appreciate your organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| The Bible talks about the least amongst us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| Absolutely. That's what you all do is look after the least amongst you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| It was raining and I turned around, me and my buddy Chris Haggerty were out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| and we turned around and Stan Brock was sneaking up on us like a ninja.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| I literally turned around and there was Stan Brock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| Being who he was, it startled me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| Being who he was, he immediately asked me for a donation from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| You've been a great friend and a great member of our community and we're just delighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| I remember at Veteran's Day, I remember when my dad was still living and we heard you speak about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| you spoke at Veteran's Day, you're not a veteran but you were a little boy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| and you talked about the cliffs of Dover and how you were standing and you would watch the Germans fly over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| and the Spitfires going after them and you said you were a little boy in your knickers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| I remember that and those were short pants, I believe, if I remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| I just remember so many things about you. It's just an honor being here with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| I've talked too long. I'll turn it over to the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| Is there a second on that, I talk too long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, and I simply want to recognize from around the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| the humanitarian efforts that provide medical and dental care for the least among them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| And I simply want to say, well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=1900)|

| 0:48:47| If you would, give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=2927)|
| 0:48:57| Mr. Chairman, my name is Jack Woodall and I live at 9520 Westland Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=2937)|
| 0:49:05| I have been involved in the subdivision regulation process as a member of the Westland West Community Association and also a member of the Westland West Community Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=2945)|
| 0:49:16| I've been involved on my own behalf over the past several, actually last year and a half while these new regulations have recently been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=2956)|
| 0:49:27| The MPC delayed and much of this delay came because of the fact that the MPC wanted to give the city and county an opportunity to participate in the regulation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=2967)|
| 0:49:34| And with regard to sidewalks, sought an effort to see whether or not the county and the city were interested in adopting ordinances about sidewalks that would address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=2974)|
| 0:49:54| The county chose not to do that. And so about several months ago, the MPC decided not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=2994)|
| 0:50:03| And so the Metropolitan Planning Commission voted and they voted to require new subdivisions to have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3003)|
| 0:50:12| Tennessee state law gives these regional planning agencies the responsibility to approve final plats for subdivisions before they can be filed with the registry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3012)|
| 0:50:22| And these final plats assure that the subdivisions comply with land laws and establish the legal rights of the sellers and the purchasers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3022)|
| 0:50:33| That are set out in the subdivision plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| As part of that responsibility, the regional planning agencies adopt regulations so that the developers of new subdivisions have a process to get those final plats in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3039)|
| 0:50:48| And assure that the plats properly comply with local laws and also the requirements of the different organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3048)|
| 0:50:55| The statute doing this dates back to 1935 and this process has been quite effective in my view over that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3055)|
| 0:51:08| The challenge to the process here is, and before the state legislature and before the county now, is for one reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| The Knox County subdivision regulations now require sidewalks in all new subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3074)|
| 0:51:24| And the current regulations give the Metropolitan Planning Commission the authority to require sidewalks by an affirmative vote of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3084)|
| 0:51:31| And over the last several years in particular, there have been any number of these votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3091)|
| 0:51:46| In fact, well over 50% is my understanding of new subdivisions are required to have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| The new subdivision regulations, rather than require a vote of the Metropolitan Planning Commission requirement, require essentially a negative vote by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3113)|
| 0:52:04| To say that this subdivision is not appropriate for sidewalks and therefore they will not be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3124)|
| 0:52:13| Some developers were upset by this change and they have lobbied the state legislature and the county council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3133)|
| 0:52:23| To introduce this bill to essentially give the county commission overview of the MPC subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3143)|
| 0:52:38| But in my view, this dispute about sidewalks is not a reason for the county commission or the state legislature in that regard to decide that now it needs to stick its hand out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3158)|
| 0:52:52| In the middle of the subdivision regulations, which are extensive and deal with things that have much engineering and other sorts of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3172)|
| 0:53:06| In this regard, one of the things that has been said is that the MPC has required sidewalks in parental responsibility zones in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| And there are some subdivisions that aren't in parental responsibility zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3193)|
| 0:53:31| But the truth of the matter is school buses don't go in subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| Schools that have to get to the entrance of their subdivision to get to school would still, in new subdivisions, have to walk on the streets when sidewalks are not in those subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3217)|
| 0:53:51| And in my view, the commission should simply decide that it's just not necessary for this one issue that's being dealt with right now very well by MPC to change this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3231)|
| 0:54:08| Thank you, sir. Director Green, could you please come to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3248)|
| 0:54:20| If you will give your name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3260)|
| 0:54:29| Yes, sir. Could you give us your opinion and that of the MPC commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3269)|
| 0:54:37| Their opinion has been that the adoption of regulations by a legislative body is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3277)|
| 0:54:44| And I share that philosophical opinion that I feel that the review of subdivisions according to those adopted regulations is an administrative process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3284)|
| 0:54:56| and that is appropriately placed with the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| It is a matter that should be evaluated by the elected body, and that body make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| And there are other changes you are seeking in this legislation also, sir. Could you please explain those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3308)|
| 0:55:15| The initial legislation removed the requirement that the planning commission hold a public hearing prior to making a recommendation on subdivision regulation adoption or amendments to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3315)|
| 0:55:22| I propose that change, that the planning commission hold a public hearing, because that would allow the public to weigh in at an earlier time and allow the planning commission to handle issues rather than putting them on the county commission or the elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| Another one would be that the staff could be delegated the authority to approve final plans rather than have them go through the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3328)|
| 0:55:34| Final planning is basically a technical process to meet the regulations, and the final plan is an as-built plan for that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3334)|
| 0:56:04| After the lots have been staked, the roads constructed, utilities in place, our planning commission approves final plans on a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3364)|
| 0:56:14| I ask them, and they seldom look at the plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| The staff has reviewed it, they have input from engineering staff, KUB, so it's basically approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| It has to wait for a month to get on the MPC agenda, slowing the process for the development community to no real purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| The third provision would be that any amendment to those regulations would be reviewed by the planning commission and recommendations to the elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3393)|
| 0:56:40| Anybody else have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3400)|
| 0:56:58| Is there any? Mr. Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| Mr. Whittall, I want to address one issue. You said that school buses are not allowed in subdivisions. Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3424)|
| 0:57:17| Okay, because I was just wondering, because in my section of the town where the subdivisions are at, they're in all of our subdivisions as they drive through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3437)|
| 0:57:27| but I'm way out in the country on the north end out here, so I just wanted to make that clear. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Green, Tennessee Code 13-3403, you know, has this, what the current law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3460)|
| 0:57:50| Why do you think the state had the planning body be responsible for these type regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| I mean, and I understand, you know, there's 95 counties, but do you have any idea why it's been in place this long and nobody's challenged it before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3477)|
| 0:58:08| I have no idea. Tradition may weigh heavily with it. I can't presume to know what the legislature thought in 1935.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3488)|
| 0:58:16| I know in other states, subdivision regulations do have to be adopted by the chief legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3496)|
| 0:58:23| and I think that may have depended on the whim of the will of the legislature in place when that initial enabling legislation was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3503)|
| 0:58:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3515)|

| 0:59:09| to increase the limit for food, refreshments, foodstuffs, entertainment, and beverages provided as part of a meal or other event to not exceed $50 per occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3549)|
| 0:59:24| Do I have a motion? Motion to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| I asked this last time. I'm going to ask this again. I asked, in what instances have we ran into this where this is a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3570)|
| 0:59:39| Commissioner Anderson gave an example of tickets to Clarence Brown, I believe, that are $50. We're only allowed $35. You have to pay the extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3579)|
| 0:59:49| Commissioner Wright had very elegantly described that it's the value of the food, not the price of the ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3589)|
| 0:59:57| Are there any places that we're actually running into a problem with this? Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3597)|
| 1:00:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm not going to say I've run into a problem with this, but this limit is placed on us by the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3604)|
| 1:00:16| And it's really an item under ethics to make sure that we are acting ethically when we accept the invitation of someone to discuss certain items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3616)|
| 1:00:23| The state legislature has told us what to do. They've said what the state limit is, and then they've told us to go do something also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3623)|
| 1:00:41| And I think we took the limit that may have been in existence when this regulation took effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| The problem that we face right now would be the people in Nashville may deal with inviting a commissioner to Nashville to discuss an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3648)|
| 1:01:00| and they're thinking the limit is $50, and we're acting under a $35 limit, and I do not want to leave us in a loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| If the state's requiring us to do it and setting the state limit, then I think we should coincide with that limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3667)|
| 1:01:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| Thank you. And as I said last week when we discussed this at the work session, my main concern was I didn't want us to be put in a position on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| where I felt like we were voting for a raise or to increase any type of gift that a commission could receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3690)|
| 1:01:39| I appreciate Commissioner Daley's research and work on this, and I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| We do want to make sure that our rules and regulation match up with the state, but for the record, I just want to create a ‑‑ I don't want to create any perception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3705)|
| 1:01:52| that we as a commission are trying to put us in a position where people can increase any gifts or try to influence any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3712)|
| 1:02:01| As I said, I've never ran into any problems around this, and as the ‑‑ actually, I think when I was elected Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3721)|
| 1:02:11| I think you're the one that said to me you need to get a bigger mailbox because you're invited to so many different events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| and of course none of them come with the you've got to pay your way on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| I really can't recall very many things that we've gotten something for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| But with that said, I want to be clear that my only concern about this as I expressed last week was just around creating a perception that we're trying to do some sort of raise for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3749)|
| 1:02:38| I get it. It's probably got to be done, but I was just really truly just more worried about our perception. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3758)|
| 1:02:45| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| Thank you, Chairman. Just a couple of things I just wanted to say. Commissioner Wright brought up a good, I think, instance that we are invited to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3769)|
| 1:02:58| Several of us go to Nashville for conferences and meetings and training, and the restaurants there are a lot more expensive than they are than some of them are here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3778)|
| 1:03:14| So I just wanted to let everybody know who's listening in the audience today or at home, we're talking about $15 up in it, which I have not had any problems with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3794)|
| 1:03:30| Like you say, we get invited to everything, but we pay for our tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| But I can see going to other places and when we're there for Legislative Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| So I just want to make sure that it's not just for county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| We're talking about all of Knox County employees and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| So this is a Knox Countywide change that we're doing, and it is not costing taxpayers anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3834)|
| 1:04:04| And so I just wanted to make those two things clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| We like to follow what our state legislators are doing, and we have a close relationship with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| And this is what they've all agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| So that's all I wanted to say is to make sure that you know it's not costing Knox County, and we're talking about all of Knox County employees that travel quite a bit more than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3862)|
| 1:04:32| Commissioner Anders? No, just waiting on the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| We have a second before us. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed say no. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3878)|
| 1:04:56| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3896)|
| 1:05:08| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| Motion to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3914)|
| 1:05:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was going to recognize our Knox County Property Assessor, John Whitehead, if he'll come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3920)|
| 1:05:28| I know that the Comptroller of the Treasury sent you and the county mayor a letter stating the new requirement for the annual training of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3928)|
| 1:05:38| County Board of Equalization. Members, would you like to just update us on what the process is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| Basically, they just- And name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| John Whitehead, the property assessor, 1424 Dare Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| And the Comptroller has sent us where the legislation passed for the required training, four hours of required training for the County Board of Equalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| They also sent us a copy of a resolution they've sent to every county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| And we followed that resolution to set pay for the county board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3970)|
| 1:06:17| But that item has been a budget item in my office for many years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| And so it wasn't something that you all- Something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| It has been for the last several years. And it's not a new item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| The only thing it might be is the half day of training that's required by the state now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| And that's actually on our next agenda item, on the pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| When did the bill take effect? Was that just January 1st that the training is required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| The Comptroller's office is furnishing training free this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| Now, we don't know what they're going to have. As I understand it, they're working with CTAS to work something out for the next years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| But for this year, the state's free of this training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| I'm sorry. Will our board members be complying with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| Well, as I understand it, they have to. It's a requirement by law now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4032)|
| 1:07:19| I guess you might as well stay there, because the next item is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| Seeing no last one and no further discussion, we have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed say no. The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| Item 907 is a resolution setting pursuant to state law the compensation of the Knox County Board of Equalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4055)|
| 1:07:43| at $125 per day for members, alternates, and hearing officers, and $135 per day for the chair and secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4063)|
| 1:07:53| Motion to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| Commissioner Skinner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| Do you want to just give us a brief history on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| In other words, is this the format that we've used for a lot of years, or is this a new increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4082)|
| 1:08:09| No, the resolution is new. We've done it strictly by budget before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| but when the state sent the resolution, we checked with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| and they thought it would be a good thing to do, set pay by resolution, and it has still come before you in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4098)|
| 1:08:26| And like I say, the amount that they're being paid has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| The only thing that may be a change is the half-day training that they're required to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| Is that something that we need to take action on to give you authority to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| And this is the same pay that you've been paying for 10, 12 years, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| The pay is, but we haven't paid for the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| The half-day of training, the four hours training, we have not paid for them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| It hasn't been required. Basically, some of them went, some of them didn't go, but now it's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4137)|
| 1:09:04| I was just going to say, well, in my opinion, if the state's requiring our people to go for training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| it seems like we ought to pay them for their time to go for training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| But I'll defer to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| That is the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| Johnny's organization has always had it budgeted because it became mandamus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| and because it came as a resolution, we needed to put you on notice in terms of a budgetary figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| that it's really not debatable anymore on his part that this body needs to comply with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| So we recommend that Johnny bring it to you in a resolution instead of just a budgetary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| because in a budgetary, you all may say, wait a minute, when you start dealing with budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| and not have a clear understanding that we as a community and John as the property assessor has no option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4186)|
| 1:09:54| That's mainly what was trying to be communicated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| And as he said, the budgetary figures are the same except the training's been added on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| and then from this point on, it should be just perpetual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| Would it be proper at this time to make a motion that we pay for the four-hour training that's required by state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4208)|
| 1:10:16| for our members of the Board of Equalization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4216)|
| 1:10:22| It's in there, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| In the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Not for the training, not for the four hours of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| Training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| She says it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| You can't deny Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| She just said it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| Can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| On the training session, we pay $125 a day for the regular members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| and $135 for the chairman and the secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| But when they go to training, they haven't elected a chairman or secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| So would the pay be just on the $125?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| Yeah, the base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| They're not performing any kind of duty on the Equalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| They're just getting trained, so I would say the base pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| Everyone's subject to the same training on that day, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| Mr. Schoonmaker, are you satisfied it's in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| You're doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4289)|

| 1:11:32| Ordinances on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| The first one is O-18-2-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| It's amended in the Knox County Charter, Article 2, Section 2.02,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| entitled Other Powers by Revising the Provisions Related to the Employment of Outside Auditors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| and providing for the submission of the charter amendment set out in this ordinance to the voters of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| Knox County Charter is adopted November 8, 1988, as amended on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4313)|

| 1:12:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| Okay, because this is a charter amendment, we have to have a roll call vote, and it has to pass by two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4324)|

| 1:13:08| Employee Code of Ethics and Conduct, to increase the limit for food, refreshments, foodstuffs, entertainment, and beverages provided as part of a meal or other event to not exceed $50 per occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4388)|

| 1:13:31| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4411)|

| 1:14:05| Item 48, presentation of the Knox County Health Department's 2017 Annual Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4445)|
| 1:14:13| Dr. Buchanan, could you give your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| Martha Buchanan, Knox County Health Department, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| I'll pass these out when I get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| But thank you for an opportunity to have some time and commission to talk about our Annual Report, something that we're really proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| And we really believe it's really important to keep you all up to date on all the things that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4471)|
| 1:14:36| And when you get this report, you'll see some of the stuff that we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| one of which is completed the 2017 Youth Behavior Risk Survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| which is a survey done across Knox County schools to get an idea of what our youth are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| asking questions about behaviors and suicidal thoughts and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| It's something that the schools and many of our partners use to make decisions or to seek grant funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4496)|
| 1:15:03| We also play a very large role in syndromic surveillance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| which is looking at what people in Knox County are getting sick from and going to the ER for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| or even maybe being transported by an ambulance for so that we can see things before they become a bigger problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| and can reach out to those facilities and figure out what's going on and work with them to resolve those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| We also are celebrating our fifth year as an academic health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| We are the only one in the state and the first in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| So we're very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| It's kind of like a learning hospital but for public health with the UT Department of Public Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| where our staff get opportunities that they wouldn't otherwise have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4536)|
| 1:15:42| And so we're very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| In addition to that, of course, we vaccinated 11,000 school children in Knox County this past year for flu vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4544)|
| 1:15:51| helping keep our school children healthy, which is always important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| So I just want to share this with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| As always, we'll continue to work with our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| and keep you informed about important things affecting our community like the opioid epidemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| increasing infectious diseases like hepatitis C, and the ongoing challenges of obesity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| So I'm happy to entertain questions, but just wanted to share this with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| Dr. Buchanan, I think you said that 11,000 school children were vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| We have 60,000 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| Do we know what percentage of the other students received a vaccination from maybe their primary care doctor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| But what I can tell you is across the country, when you look at school children vaccination rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| so 11,000 out of 60,000, I can't do that math in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| But just by this program, we were above other school districts for vaccinating our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4597)|
| 1:16:45| And we know that a lot of kids get vaccinated by their own physicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| We just don't have a way to track that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| And I think we just last month approved this contract again for next year on the behavioral health study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4612)|
| 1:17:02| For?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| For the kids in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| No, there's no contract for it, so no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| Who are we doing that through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| We do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| We do hire temps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| That's what you approved of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| a contract with a temp agency to have staff for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| I forgot about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| I was thinking about the vaccine itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| I'm like, we don't have a contract for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| Martha, the 11,000, do you know how many children that normally got it when we had the nasal mist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4650)|
| 1:17:40| Because I saw where they're thinking of bringing that back this next year that they've revamped it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4660)|
| 1:17:50| and hopefully it's going to be more productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| So I was just wondering, the 11,000, how many we had had, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| That is lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| It is definitely lower than we have done in the past, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| A couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| You know, kids don't want to go to school and get a shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| and some parents didn't want to send their kids to school and get a shot without mom and dad being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| We did offer that opportunity, but, you know, parents have jobs and they're really not able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| We're very excited about FluMist coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| It really allows us to open that program up, and it makes it a lot easier for more kids to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| And it's really such an easy thing for the parents, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| They sign the consent form, Billy goes to school and gets a flu shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| and mom doesn't have to take, or dad doesn't have to take time off from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| Well, thank you for everything you're doing, and hopefully this new FluMist will work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| and we won't have to worry about kids not taking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Thank you, Ms. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| You were talking about there is injection for, you know, FluMist and things like that to try to be preventive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4739)|
| 1:19:09| But once it starts, is there any other things that the schools could do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| Because that's normally where it starts and really spreads rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| And I'm just mentioning this, and I don't know if it would ever work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| but in some other schools in other countries, what they do is once it starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| I think it's an airborne infection, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| Droplet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| And these other schools, once they start seeing just the first case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4769)|
| 1:19:36| they start doing masks of some sort, breathing, since it is sort of an airborne type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| Droplet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| Yeah, but whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| Droplet should come out of your respiratory tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| But anyway, I see some of these others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| What other things could we do to stem the tide before it got like it was this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| And I think there was, what, three strands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| There are always three or four strands that circulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| One of them is more predominant than the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| This year the most predominant one is H3N2, as we've all heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| So there are always several strands that circulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| There's just one that's predominant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| And all of those strands are always contained in the flu vaccine that is provided each year from the CDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4812)|
| 1:20:19| and the World Health Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| Our Knox County schools do a great job of keeping their facilities clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| The most important thing we can all do to reduce disease is to wash our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| Masks are helpful, but once they get wet with, you know, perspiration or you just breathe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| they're no longer effective, so you have to change them out periodically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| It's real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| I don't know if you've ever tried to wear a mask for eight hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| It is really uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| So washing your hands, staying home if you're sick, and taking your flu vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| those are three things you can do that really help, we know, reduce disease in the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4850)|
| 1:20:56| And one other thing, how long after these flu strains start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| are you still shedding after your main symptoms go away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| It's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| It depends on your vaccination status and how old you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| So there are some factors that go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| Kids actually shed longer than adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| If a kid's been vaccinated, he or she will shed for fewer days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| but we can shed virus for up to a week after we're sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| Not as much as when we have a fever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| That's why we say if you don't have a fever for 24 hours, it's okay to go back to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| because you're just not shedding as much virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| Where does the CDC put us on the bell curve of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| Are we on the downside of the flu season?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| You know, the challenge with surveillance is we don't know the cases are going down until we see them going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| And right now, you know, it appears in certain areas of the country it may be leveling off or going down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4909)|
| 1:21:55| but in other areas it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| So overall we're still kind of, we're not climbing as fast as we were in cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| but we're still seeing a lot of flu activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| Carson, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| What if a commissioner shows up to a commission meeting and they have flu last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| He exhibited excellent infection control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| That's called social distancing, and we encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| How about in South Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| We were trying to get him in the balcony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| Is that distance one mile or two miles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| All the way to South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| Item number 49, spread of record, the distillery licenses issued by the Knox County clerk to Knox Whiskey Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4956)|

| 1:23:05| 52, discussion item of the Knox County Commission and Knox County Schools meeting jointly regarding the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4985)|
| 1:23:14| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| We had several commissioners from the Finance Committee ask that when the school system presents their budget to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=4997)|
| 1:23:27| previously they've done it on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| It's been a team from their finance department and their administration of about five to seven people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5010)|
| 1:23:38| and it usually lasts an hour, hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| And so instead of taking that many people to have 11 separate meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| what we'd like to do is have one central meeting last two and a half hours, whatever, with all commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5026)|
| 1:23:54| And I've run the idea behind Russ Oaks, and he said that would be a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| And this way we can all benefit from each other's questions to the school system regarding the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5039)|
| 1:24:06| And then, of course, obviously you would have any opportunity after that meeting to address them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5046)|
| 1:24:13| And this would occur after the school board approves their budget before we would approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5053)|
| 1:24:22| And it would be something to be held in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5062)|
| 1:24:29| Does anybody think that's an awesome idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| I think it's a good idea to have it public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| I rather enjoy my sit-down hour and a half where we can drill down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| and I can ask things that I normally wouldn't ask in a public meeting and maybe be a bit more defined in my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5081)|
| 1:24:49| But this won't impede me from being able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| In addition, so I think this is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| And it would just be a meeting between the administration of the school board and the county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| There's no public input session or anything during that, the same as like we did in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| And the previous meetings that I've had with Dr. McIntyre and Bob Thomas, my school rep has also been there with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5105)|
| 1:25:15| I'm sure these were joint meetings with your school rep and the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| Yeah, the esteemed staff and team at the clerk's office would ask that it be in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| because the recording devices don't pick up well over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| So just have the meeting over here instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| It's my understanding it does not need to be recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| It's not in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| It's just an information only meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| It's not a voting or deliberation meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| It was my understanding that that's why we could go to the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| I was just relaying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| I mean, we can clarify that down the road, but that's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| It would be something that we will eventually be voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| Yeah, but it's an information gathering meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| Do you want to hold this as a function of the finance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| Sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| I'll put you in charge of setting it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| I'll be honored to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| Any further discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| Madam Clerk, can you please go to the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| Item 53 is discussion item to set the next public hearing for the Charter Amendment Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5188)|
| 1:26:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| We originally had set this meeting for today after beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5195)|
| 1:26:42| but we were told that we couldn't have our first meeting until we actually have voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| So we are having tonight after zoning a public hearing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| We need to set the second meeting so that it happens before we vote at our next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5213)|
| 1:26:59| So I am suggesting after the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5219)|
| 1:27:06| Is everybody in agreement with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| So it will be 6 o'clock or immediately following the March, I believe it's 19th, work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5230)|
| 1:27:18| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| Are there any announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5242)|
| 1:27:28| Thanks, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| Two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| Wednesday evening, you're all welcome to join Andrew, Roberto, and Lynn Fugate and I down at West Hills Flat and Taps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5250)|
| 1:27:37| We're having a very kind of casual meet and greet with your representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| It has been publicized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| I know that the focus did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| The shopper, they've all sort of put it out there, and I put it on my social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| So you're welcome to join us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| Secondly, and Mr. Law Director, you can confirm if we need to vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| but I'd like to take some of our extra jailhouse food and share it with the scouts that are now doing their meeting next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5277)|
| 1:28:03| If that's – is that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| I thought you liked them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5285)|

| 1:32:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| While we've got a few minutes left, I just wanted to update everyone on a House and Senate bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| that's going through the legislature that will have a dramatic impact on the cities and counties across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5552)|
| 1:32:39| It's House Bill 2279, and what it's going to deal with is the new small cell wireless structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5559)|
| 1:32:48| The bill is about 17 pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| It's been written by AT&T and Verizon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| but some people across the state are calling it the taxpayer subsidy bill for AT&T and Verizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5577)|
| 1:33:06| What it does is it basically strips the local regulations away from what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5586)|
| 1:33:13| and what kind of controls we can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| Dwight Vander Veidt has been working diligently on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| Our Tennessee County Services Association has been working on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| and I've been working with the leaders with the town of Farragut on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| But here's the problem, is that when these structures, we have to approve their contract to put one in very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5606)|
| 1:33:38| They get to pay us a $100 application fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| The problem is, and Dwight could probably verify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| but basically his research has said that it's going to take Knox County to be able to process this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5627)|
| 1:33:55| is basically about in the $260 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| So, again, this gets back to the point of taxpayer money subsidizing AT&T, Verizon, US Cellular, and the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5639)|
| 1:34:08| The other component of this bill is that, for instance, in the town of Farragut on Turkey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| Can I ask something about that point, that part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| There is still a monthly or yearly fee that comes back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| Yeah, yeah, I'll get to that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| So in Farragut, in Turkey Creek, in fact, if you'll notice in front of Red Robin, there's a cell tower there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5665)|
| 1:34:33| It's about 40 feet tall, but you don't notice it because it's painted green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| The problem is, under the new regulations, a community couldn't say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| it's got to blend in and with all the other light poles that are painted green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| they could be any color that they want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| The issue that I had with this bill, and I spoke with David Connor on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| who's the executive director of the Tennessee County Services Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| is once this application is approved, which, in other words, they want us to jump through hoops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5699)|
| 1:35:05| at the county level and the city level to approve these applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| then they want a year to be able to have the opportunity to install these structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| And then if they don't get it installed in a year, then they can ask for a delay to be able to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5715)|
| 1:35:23| My point was, if they want us to jump through hoops to approve their contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| to get this small cell tower installed, they better install it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5728)|
| 1:35:32| So I asked for a six-month time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| Dwight just now told me today that they've now agreed to a nine-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| So we're making a little bit of headway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| But here's the other thing, back to the towers that are installed in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5742)|
| 1:35:48| Because these are in the public right-of-way and they're considered as a utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| they have to pay a franchise fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| Each one of those three towers, Farragut is getting $2,000 per tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5755)|
| 1:36:01| Under the new regulations, they would get $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5761)|
| 1:36:07| So we're the budget entity for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| So down the road, this could have a direct financial impact to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| to the city, and any town in the entire state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| Unfortunately, it seems to be going fast through Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| because a lot of the senators and representatives are pro-AT&T, Verizon, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5784)|
| 1:36:37| So it's something we need to be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| I'd be glad to forward this bill on to you for your reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| The first five or six pages is just definitions, but you need to see what the balance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| And Louise Povlin, the alderman for town of Farragut, probably is familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| because they were the first ones to have a cell tower regulation enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| Could we recognize her for a few minutes then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| Just to clarify, Louise Povlin, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| The cell towers that are on Parkside Drive, what they basically did was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5826)|
| 1:37:12| they took down the light pole that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| They replaced it with what looked like the light pole, like all the other light poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| It's just sturdier, and they put their cell capacity into it, but it still is a light pole as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5839)|
| 1:37:27| So all they did was put something in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| It's basically stealth, and that's the other concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| is that we won't have the ability to have stealth technology put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| And that's a big concern when you're talking about neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| That's really where, because of the way this cell technology works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| they need to be like 400 yards away from each other or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| so it's going to end up in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| And we would like to have some say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| because most of us don't want to live with a very ugly cell tower right outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| We'd like it to have some stealth technology if possible, and that's our other concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5879)|
| 1:38:05| And then one of the other things is we said in our county rules that it could be 38 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| They're saying 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| I mean, it's just a shame that we're going to lose this control over our zoning and planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5893)|
| 1:38:25| The other thing is they want to be classified as a public utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| but yet they don't want to pay the price that's associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| So in turn, we're going to be supplementing the cellular manned companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5914)|
| 1:38:42| That's a heck of an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| Well, I think we just need to be aware because it's not going to affect us tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| but next fall when things start popping up, you're going to get phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| why is this, these trucks out here doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| And we basically have to say, well, we can't do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| because Nashville said we've lost our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| So the light poles on Parkside Drive are the actual cell towers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| It's got the components on it, the nodes are wrapped around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| You can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| If you're facing Red Robin, it's about maybe 50 feet to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| But in that case, though, it's maintained as a light pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| Under the new rules, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| And you could have multiple towers constructed right next to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| one Verizon, one U.S. Cellular, one AT&T, one T-Mobile, one XYZ Mobile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5978)|
| 1:39:44| and we've got five carriers here, but there's 11 nationwide that could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5984)|
| 1:39:52| It could be the Wild West again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| What's our delegation's temperature on it, do you know, or have you checked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| Some of our representatives have signed on as co-sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6002)|
| 1:40:07| So that's why we've been working with the Tennessee County Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| and Dwight's done a fantastic job trying to relay to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| What's the bill numbers again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| House Bill 2279.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| What efforts have the city had in helping us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| They're aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| I know they've been working with the Municipal League, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| our County Commissioners Association as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| So Dwight may have more of a quick update because he was on the phone this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| with some folks, and I didn't want to preempt your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| We appreciate your assistance on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| TML has been extensively involved, Mr. Chairman, along with Tennessee County Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6047)|
| 1:40:53| Our interests here are pretty well aligned, so they've been engaged in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6053)|
| 1:40:59| I think Commissioner Schoonmaker summed it up nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| I will say a lot of progress has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| When we took our first set of these applications in last year, we took in six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| ultimately denied most of them for various reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| but at that time heights were proposed that were as significant as 120 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6072)|
| 1:41:19| And so you start talking about a 120-foot steel pole in a residential setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| and you've got real problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| We've got a number of concerns still being worked through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| particularly as Commissioner Brantley alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| The bill as originally proposed would require the providers to use underground facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6091)|
| 1:41:38| only in subdivisions where utilities were required by zoning to be underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| That is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| Our zoning ordinance does not require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| That is a market decision, so it potentially had conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| where somebody could come in in a subdivision with full underground utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| and come in with aboveground facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| We've shared that concern with County Services and TML.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| I think it has been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| Some progress has been made on the issue of fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| I don't think we're exactly where we would need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| One thing I forgot to mention to Commissioner Schoonmaker earlier is there is some relief also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6127)|
| 1:42:13| There was potential for us to get more of these applications in at any one time than we can manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| I have one employee who processes these and does all of our utility work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| and he could only take on so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| The bill as originally proposed was not going to permit us to outsource that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6146)|
| 1:42:32| and then recover the cost of outsourcing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| should we get more applications in than we can handle at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| At the same time, it's got the shot clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| so when we take that application in, the meter is running for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| We thought that was just patently unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| Progress has been made there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| I think what's going to happen is that there will be an extended shot clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| when a certain volume of applications or above is received by a municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| So we are starting to see some relief, but we've got a little ways to go yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6179)|
| 1:43:05| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| And then just one other point on the financial aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| We said that they only wanted to pay $100 per application fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| which his department would have to process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| They also had a caption in there that said we could dump 20 applications at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6196)|
| 1:43:22| but the first five you can only charge us $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6202)|
| 1:43:27| The balance of the 15, I believe it's $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| So if you average that out, it's like $62.50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| and it costs us $260 just to process each application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6214)|
| 1:43:40| So you can see why people are calling it the taxpayer subsidy bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6220)|
| 1:43:47| Mr. Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| Let me ask you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| In there, you said they're using utility poles to put this on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6231)|
| 1:43:56| Not always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| Some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| Not all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| Not all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| Is there a process if those go up because technology changes so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| are they required to come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| Since they're no longer used, will they be required to take them down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| The original bill did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| That's another item that is under discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| and we believe that the industry is willing to accept remediation of obsolete facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6258)|
| 1:44:25| It's not there yet, but it's under discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| and we do think that they'll eventually agree to remove obsolete facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| But Commissioner Schoonmaker is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| In the original iteration, it was not clearly delineated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| John, I was wondering, does it make any sense or matter or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6279)|
| 1:44:45| if we drafted up a letter and had it sent to all of our local state legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6285)|
| 1:44:54| just letting them know how we feel as a body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| I mean, plus, you know, we can all contact them and all and do that too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| but, I mean, this has already been a huge problem in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6303)|
| 1:45:12| in the city and the county, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| So, I mean, what people have been upset with up to now is going to be nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6314)|
| 1:45:22| compared to what they're going to be upset with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| So, it would be nice for us to be able to show our constituents and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| how we did try to fight to save Knox County from having all these towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6329)|
| 1:45:39| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| I just wanted to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| I'm not big on the letter writing thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| I just assume we called them and talked it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| We've got their phone numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| Call them and email them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| But, I mean, in terms of making a bigger statement and to our constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| and Knox County taxpayers of letting them know that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6356)|
| 1:46:01| Let Bob finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| I just feel like it's a bigger statement when you talk to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| either face-to-face or on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| It's my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6374)|
| 1:46:15| Well, and, again, I wanted to just, because we've got members from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| and all of them, I'm sure, have cell phones in their pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| But what I want them to understand is with the new 5G technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6382)|
| 1:46:26| we're talking about poles every 600 feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6386)|
| 1:46:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| So, yes, that's just the distance of two football fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| That's how close it has to be for the transmission of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| So, you can see why Dwight is now going to be inundated with requests for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6400)|
| 1:46:47| So, it's going to be more fun to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| And we're talking about if you live in a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| you could wake up the next morning and you could have one right by your mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| That's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| If anybody in the audience or TV is not realizing how big an ordeal this is, it's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6421)|
| 1:47:10| Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| I think the best thing to do is when you're out talking to your constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| say, do you know somebody in the House?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| Call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| Here's what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| And that would be better because they'll hear from more voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| And let's go for a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| No further discussion or announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| We will adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| We'll reconvene here at 7 o'clock for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6451)|
| 1:47:36| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| I call to order this February meeting of the Knox County Zoning Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| Madam Clerk, please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6464)|

| 1:48:10| First item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6492)|
| 1:48:26| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| May we get the report from the MPC Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| Mr. Chair, members of the commission, before I start on this, I want to show you one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| We've been working, taking steps to make sure the applicants are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| The latest thing, one of my staff came up with a stamp to put on the outside of the envelope in red that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6522)|
| 1:48:48| Important Meeting Notice Enclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| So not only do we have the yellow sheet inside with the red lettering, but a notice, a stamp, put it on the envelope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6530)|
| 1:48:58| I'm glad to bring that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6538)|
| 1:49:08| My lunches with Gerald are starting to pay off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6548)|
| 1:49:16| On this one, this was a unanimous vote by the Planning Commission on consent to recommend approval of the Sector Plan Amendment to LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6556)|
| 1:49:25| The uses in that area are primarily residential and agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| In fact, the property for which the plan designation and the rezoning request is developed with the residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6569)|
| 1:49:36| It's a small parcel, 0.45 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6576)|
| 1:49:42| Does the applicant wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| Move to approve pre-MPC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6588)|

| 1:49:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| 1-B-18-RZ is also a request of Robert A. Maples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| It's for rezoning from OA office to RA low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6603)|
| 1:50:08| The property description is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| Does the applicant hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| Can we get the report from the MPC staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| The Commission voted unanimously on consent to recommend approval of the rezoning of the property to RA low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6621)|
| 1:50:28| The zoning would allow the use that's on the property is consistent with the surrounding uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6628)|
| 1:50:35| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6635)|
| 1:50:36| Move to approve pre-MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| The proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6640)|

| 1:50:44| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| 1-C-18-RZ is a request of Alexander Bozot for rezoning from A agricultural to PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6649)|
| 1:51:01| at a density of five dwelling units per acre located north side of Kane Road, northeast of Amherst Road, Commission District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6661)|
| 1:51:10| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6672)|

| 1:51:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| The Planning Commission voted 14-0 to recommend rezoning of the property to plan residential at a density of 3.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6679)|
| 1:51:27| The zoning at that density would be compatible with the surrounding land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| and would also comply with the recommendations of the Hillside Protection Plan for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6691)|
| 1:51:36| It is a 16.44 acre tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| Does the applicant wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| I make a motion to approve pre-MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| There is some opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| Somebody waved their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| They waved their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| I don't know if they're in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| I didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| With a proper motion and a second before us, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| 1-E-18-RZ is a request of Huber Properties for rezoning from CN Neighborhood Commercial with four conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6731)|
| 1:52:18| to CN Neighborhood Commercial with no conditions, located southeast side of South North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6738)|
| 1:52:25| northeast of Choteau Road, Commission District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| We get the report from the MPC staff, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| The Planning Commission voted 10-2 to recommend approval of the CN Neighborhood Commercial zoning for the 7.9 acre tract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6761)|
| 1:52:48| subject to three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| The conditions that the Commission recommended remain on the property address lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6770)|
| 1:52:56| mandating that the lighting be full cut off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| a condition requiring the development to be subject to a unified architectural design standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6780)|
| 1:53:06| compatible with its neighborhood character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6786)|
| 1:53:09| and the third one would be that any development be subject to use on review by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6789)|
| 1:53:16| The fourth condition, which has been removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| was one limiting the uses to only those identified on a copy of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6799)|
| 1:53:25| when this zoning was approved some years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| It was found that neither the Planning Commission nor the developer can anticipate uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6807)|
| 1:53:33| and the Planning Commission felt that it would not be appropriate to limit the development in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6813)|
| 1:53:41| Does the applicant wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6821)|
| 1:53:50| We accept the three conditions that are to remain, so that's agreeable to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6830)|
| 1:53:57| In other words, we are in agreement with the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| I just wanted to compliment Mr. John Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| When he appeared before the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| there was people from the community out there that weren't quite comfortable with what he was proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| and he reached out to them and held a community meeting at the rural metro fire station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6858)|
| 1:54:23| and I have heard absolutely no comments from anybody after that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6863)|
| 1:54:29| I think everybody understood exactly what he had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| and I appreciate you taking the time to reach out to everybody in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| and explain exactly what's going on and, of course, the follow-up from Mr. King as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| Really a little bit of follow-up from what Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| The original battle of this corner was pretty well fought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| I mean, it was a tough battle for Mr. Huber to overcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| and I think he and his development have exceeded the expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| and so I think I was going to make that comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| that that's turned into be a great little neighborhood commercial node there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| and you've done a great job with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| It was a great vision of seeing what the community would need and planning for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| Mr. Huber does a great job of reaching out to citizens of subdivisions in the area he's working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6912)|
| 1:55:19| to make understanding very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| Did you make the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| Not yet, but I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| I thought that some of your colleagues could learn from the way you handle things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| because you do it in a very professional manner and just don't get upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6929)|
| 1:55:37| I have to just say I agree with all these that the commissioners have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| He does a great job of communicating with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6944)|
| 1:55:45| I don't want his ego to get too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| I think it all comes down to Sister Paulina's when we were in school together at Sacred Heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| She kept us both in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180226?start=6953)|
