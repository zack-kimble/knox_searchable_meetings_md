| 0:00:30| For those of you who haven't been to any public meetings, my name is Krista Kugrow. I'm an attorney for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=30)|
| 0:00:37| And I worked with other city staff members to help draft the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=37)|
| 0:00:42| So thank you all for being here. We know that this is an exciting opportunity for a lot of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=42)|
| 0:00:49| And we've sort of been waiting a long time to sort of get the ball rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=49)|
| 0:00:52| So we're excited to be able to do the permits at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=52)|
| 0:00:55| And we wanted to offer this training so we can walk through the permit application with you and answer any questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=55)|
| 0:01:03| I'll let the other city staff members who are here introduce themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=63)|
| 0:01:09| Jesse Mayshaw, Director of Communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=69)|
| 0:01:11| And we've been trying to communicate a lot about this and what it means and how it works and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=71)|
| 0:01:18| So thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=78)|
| 0:01:20| And I'm Donna Dyer, the Revenue Administrator for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=80)|
| 0:01:23| So I oversee the Business Tax Office, which is the starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=83)|
| 0:01:30| I'm Debbie Sharp with the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| I'm the Assistant Neighborhood Coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| And part of the ordinance was to notify either your neighborhood organization, if there is one, and the surrounding houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=95)|
| 0:01:43| So I'll help you figure out what that would mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| So I've got a PowerPoint presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| It's going to be up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| I don't have copies for you to follow along, but hopefully you do for your e-mail address on the sign-up sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| And I can e-mail it out afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| There are some hyperlinks in the PowerPoint presentation that will be useful to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| The other documents that were at the tour, there was the application itself, which is available online, also has hyperlinks in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=124)|
| 0:02:13| and a FAQs document, which should answer most of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| But again, I realize there's circumstances that come up and particular situations, and we can work through some of those questions today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=137)|
| 0:02:24| So I'm going to walk through everything with the PowerPoint, and then we'll get to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| If you have a burning question during the PowerPoint presentation, feel free to raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| But there will be an opportunity at the end for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| So with that, we'll go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| Just a little bit of an overview of what we're going to talk about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| The permitting process and the permit types, how to find the information required for permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| the other required information that you may need along the way or after you get your application filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=168)|
| 0:02:56| how to fill out the neighborhood notice form, how to pay taxes to the city and the state of Tennessee, and enforcement and violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=176)|
| 0:03:05| Okay, so a permit is required for operation of any short-term rental unit in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=185)|
| 0:03:12| Operation without that permit is illegal, and that was part of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| Come on in. We just got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| There's a sign-up sheet, if you wouldn't mind to put your email address and name on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| There's some additional documents that you may want to grab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| So a permit is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| Operation without a permit is illegal, and that's by effect of a city ordinance that became effective on January 2nd of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=211)|
| 0:03:39| The ordinance is posted online. It actually has two components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| There was the first portion and then a later amendment that added the neighborhood notice that Debbie mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| The cost varies based on the type of permit, and we're going to talk about those permit types on the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=228)|
| 0:03:55| The Type 1 permit is $70. The Type 2 and Type 3 permits are $120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| And annual renewals, if allowed, will be $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| And if you're wondering, that noise is the elevators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| It sort of sounds like a bowling alley or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| We don't have a bowling alley in this building, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| It's just the elevators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| So the reason it says annual renewals, if allowed, will be $50 is that the Type 3 permits, which are sort of a special limited-time permit, are not renewable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=258)|
| 0:04:30| But the Type 1 and Type 2 are renewable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| A business license is required from both the city and the county prior to submitting your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| The cost is $15 per jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| So can you say that again? The Type 1 permit is not renewable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| The Type 3 permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| And I'm going to talk about the permit types on the next slide and talk a little bit more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| As far as the business licenses, those are $15 per jurisdiction, so that's a total of $30, which rounds out your cost at $100 or $150, depending on the permit type that you'll be applying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=292)|
| 0:05:06| Permits will be issued through the Business License and Tax Office, which is on the fourth floor of this building, basically right over here, one floor below us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=306)|
| 0:05:15| So you get off the elevator, hang a left, and it's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| One thing I do want to note is that private agreements are not within the scope of the city's authority for regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=319)|
| 0:05:25| If you have some sort of HOA, condo association, that has rules that govern your use of your property, that is a dispute between you and your HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=325)|
| 0:05:37| We will not get involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| We are regulating this from the government's perspective, not from the private perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| So just wanted to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| As for the permit types, we've got three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| Type 1 permit is for owner-occupied units in residentially zoned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| Owner-occupied, that is the big emphasis there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| You have to own the unit, and you have to occupy it, as in live in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| These are available only to natural persons because a corporation really can't live in a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=368)|
| 0:06:16| So a natural person who owns and lives in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| The criteria for determining residency and ownership is laid out in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| We'll be looking at the deed to determine ownership, and that has to be a recorded deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| and specific governmental documents, which are the owner's motor vehicle registration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| a valid driver's license or Tennessee identification card, proof of owner's children's school registration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=394)|
| 0:06:41| the owner's voter registration card, or the owner's W-2 mailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| And so we're going to be looking for two of those documents, again, to demonstrate that you live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| Those are, once you submit those to the city, they become public records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| So for your W-2, for example, you'll want to cross through your social security number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| anything that you don't want to become a public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| Obviously, your address is essential to determining that you reside at the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| but other than that, there may be information that you want to redact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| This permit, the Type 1 permit, is available in all residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| and we'll talk a little bit later about how to find your zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| But that's the Type 1 permit, and I think that will be the majority of the permits that we see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| and those all are renewable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| The Type 2 permit is intended for non-owner-occupied in non-residentially zoned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| Now, if you occupy a unit in a non-residentially zoned district, you can still get this permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| but this is really intended for folks who may have a primary residence in a residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=469)|
| 0:07:56| you know, out west, and so they live there, and then they have some sort of condo downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| but they, you know, want to make some profit off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| Downtown is zoned commercial, C2, and so that would be a non-residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=484)|
| 0:08:11| So those are available to the owner of the property or a lessee or agent with the owner's permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=491)|
| 0:08:20| It's not allowed necessarily in all non-residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| It's only allowed in non-residential districts that allow residences or dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| So we have some industrial districts, for example, people aren't allowed to live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| so you can't get a permit in an industrial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| Just want to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| There's a limit of two Type 2 permits per committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| and so if you are applying as John Smith LLC, you can get two permits as John Smith LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=525)|
| 0:08:56| The Type 3 permit is the sort of special one that was added toward the end of kind of the legislative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=536)|
| 0:09:05| as it was going through city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| These are for non-owner occupied units in residentially zoned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| So this permit is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| This is really, really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| It's only available until February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| So if this applies to you, you have to come and get it before February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| After that, we are not accepting any applications for these permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| It is also available only to operators who operated their short-term rental unit prior to March 1st of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=570)|
| 0:09:38| So you'll have to provide some documentation to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| So those are two sort of parameters on that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| This permit is valid until January 2nd, 2019, and it is non-renewable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| So the idea behind this permit is city council wanted to allow folks who have been operating these unregulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=591)|
| 0:10:00| to have a little bit of time to sort of wind down operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| So this is what they came up with as the concept, a limited Type 3 permit that is only good for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=603)|
| 0:10:10| And of course, during that year, it can be revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| We're going to talk about that toward the end of the PowerPoint presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| But those are the types of permits that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| For finding your zoning district, how many of you have never used KGIS, Knoxville Geographic Information Systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| All right, so it looks like there's several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| So we're going to talk about that really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| Yeah, it is very user-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| It's just a super handy tool to know about because it provides a wealth of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| Okay, so what you'll do is you'll go to KGIS.org to its maps function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| So just Google KGIS maps, and it'll come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| This is what it will take you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| And so let's look at someone specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| 5267.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Fountainhead Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| One word or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| I just need the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| So what I did here is at the top there's a search function per address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| So I put in your address, and it comes up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| 5267 Fountainhead Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Smithwood Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| That's an old map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| So let's just zoom in and see what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| So can you see the screen up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| Does this look like the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Yes, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| So this is a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| Like the city limits are mapped onto this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| There's a whole lot that's actually mapped onto it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| And so I'm zooming out a little bit so you can sort of see where we are in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| So kind of out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| Are you in the city or the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| We're in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| So the county has not yet passed an ordinance to regulate short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=738)|
| 0:12:26| And so you at this point...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| Can we still get zoning, find out what the zoning does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| Sure, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| We have filled out our paperwork just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| We're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| So what I did just now was I went to the maps tab at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=762)|
| 0:12:50| And there's a bunch of options here as to what you can look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| And so what we're going to go to is the planning and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| And there's a drop-down menu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| I just click this little arrow here and it drops down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| And then we look at zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| So then it brings up this lovely color-coded map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| And this property is in RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| So the county has, much like the city, has zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| And off the top of my head, I don't know what RA stands for under the county zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| But I assume it's some sort of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| Typically, when you see R, it means residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| I can do my house if you want a house inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| Okay, we'll look at yours next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| So you can see sort of the designations here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| So let's hop over to yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| If you want to find out what RA is, you would contact the county then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| So they're going to contact Knox County to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| It's also online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| It's also online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| We'll say what RA is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| 2443 Buffett Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| B-U-F-M-A-T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Buffett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| And we've already got the zoning filter pulled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| So it shows us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Your property is R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| And so if you want to find out other information about the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| you can click this information tool at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| You can look here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| Are you Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| And there's some other information on here I will not pull up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| But it's a super handy tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| You can find out a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| You can find out everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| You can find out how much you paid, how much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| like if it's in arrears for taxes, anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| So you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| We won't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| But these designations indicate how you can use property in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=889)|
| 0:14:57| And we'll dictate what type of permit you're eligible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| So, for example, over here, this is a commercial district, C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| It's our neighborhood commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| You'll see sometimes what these slashes mean with the designation afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| That is an overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| That is the infill housing overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| So if you see that, you can just notate that on your application along with the zone that says C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| Also notate the overlay district if you see something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| Just put down the letters that you see, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| I just printed out the map to get you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| So let's hop back over to the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| So this explains what I just told you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| So if you're looking at this later, I should walk you through the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| If you are an entity applying for a permit, do we have anyone in here who's applying as a corporation or LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Then I won't go over this just to save time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| For those folks that are doing it, that way they have to show that they're entities in good standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| So that's just what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| Safety and insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| There are safety requirements that you have to verify to the city of Knoxville as part of your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| So if you have the application in front of you, flip to page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| The page numbers are at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=988)|
| 0:16:40| So the equipment that you'll be verifying that exists and is in working order in your unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1000)|
| 0:16:48| there is a smoke alarm, carbon monoxide alarm, and fire extinguisher requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Carbon monoxide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| There's no gas in the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| That question has come up, and I asked the fire marshal about it, and he said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| And at the time...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Is it for the fireplace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| What are they going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| I think this is the attached garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| There's an attached garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| I'm glad that you guys remembered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| So that's what it has to do with is kind of the attached garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| We don't want to get into the nitty-gritty of whether you have an attached garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| and trying to kind of figure that out, so we just have our card right off the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| So the verification form spells out a little bit more of where these need to be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| Outside the bedrooms, you'll see the details in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| And so you'll just have to put down, here are the number of smoke alarms I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| Here's where they're located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| That's what this form is provided for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| and then you're signing to say that this is true and that the equipment's in working order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| You also said extinguishers, but you didn't specify how many or where they have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| So there has to be at least one operable fire extinguisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| You may wish to provide more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| These are minimums, so feel free to provide more if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1091)|
| 0:18:18| So it says even those areas or rooms that are not available for occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| as part of the short-term dimensional unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| So in the other part that I occupy, I need to say where those are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| And then another question that we get frequently is whether we require insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| The city is not reviewing insurance as your homeowner's insurance as part of the permit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| But I do just want to throw out there that you probably ought to check with your homeowner's insurance provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1122)|
| 0:18:50| because if they deem that you are engaging in commercial activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| it could change your coverage, whether you're covered or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| And so that's really important for you to just check on as a general matter for both you and your occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1138)|
| 0:19:07| Site plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| So this is the following two pages in the application packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| There are two forms for the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| One is sort of a general overview where you provide summary information about your short-term rental unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| and then the following page, page six, is where you give us a drawing of your floor plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1160)|
| 0:19:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| How accurate does it have to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| Well, when you submit the application, you are verifying that it's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| As far as precision, we just want it to show the layout of the house, the number of bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| That's very essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| Just very general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| And because there's a maximum occupancy based on the number of bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| So that's a really important component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| We also want you to show where you're going to be providing parking for your guests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| because that's been a large concern as we've gone throughout this process from neighbors and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1197)|
| 0:20:04| So those are the big things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| But it does need to be accurate as far as representing the layout of your house and your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1207)|
| 0:20:15| But there is not a requirement that you have off-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| You just have to show if you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| There are some houses that don't even have off-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| So if you're going to tell people to park on the street, just show where you're going to tell people to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| For some of the older neighborhoods, if that's the scenario, just make a note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| Neighborhood notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| So this is something that Debbie mentioned at the outset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| So for type 1 and 3 permits, those that are in residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| the applicant must send notice of their activity to adjacent and nearby neighbors and the neighborhood group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1246)|
| 0:20:53| So that is provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| The form that you'll use is provided on the last page of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| What is considered adjacent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| So that is defined in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| But we provided a kind of a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| The setbacks are specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| It's 325 feet away is the first house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| So you're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| So I was asking what the rule is here and it would be about the same rule there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| So we've defined adjacent essentially to capture these shaded boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| So behind you, next to you, across the street, diagonal across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| Those are the folks that you have to notify using this form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| And so what we've done in order to make this really clear at the outset for both us and you is we want you to provide a standard map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1299)|
| 0:21:51| And I'm going to show you what that looks like and show you how to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| I'm sorry the screen keeps going black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| I have to choose this duplication thing each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| Super inconvenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| So here's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| And let me zoom in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| And then I'll show you how to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| It will be using KGIS as we did just a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| The same map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| The same map that you used for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| The same map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| If you get the same map for your zoning, you can use that same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| So this is the proper list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| Say, for example, your short-term rental was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| We want you to bring in a map that shows marked who you'll be sending the neighborhood notification form to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1352)|
| 0:22:40| And this just gives us that knowledge on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| Otherwise, you would have to come back and, like, resubmit to us who you sent it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| This just makes it a little easier for you and us on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| You can find these folks' addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| You send it to the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| You can find the property owner's address by using that little information tool that I showed you on KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| It pops up, shows you the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Does it have to be a residence there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Like, if there's a lot, do you have to send it to the lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| It says property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| So regardless of whether there's a building there or, you know, the idea is just so that people around you know what's happening at your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1393)|
| 0:23:23| Does this include commercial, like, apartments that are across the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| And typically, if it's an apartment building, there's going to be one owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| If it's a condo building, then there may be individual owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| Let us know if that comes up because it would be rather inconvenient to send this to 50 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1421)|
| 0:23:49| That's something that came up during the drafting process, and we may need to tweak the ordinance to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| But if it's an apartment building, it's probably owned by one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| And if it's a condo building, maybe you're downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| And if you're downtown, you're a Type 2 permit, and you don't have to send this notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| So it's kind of all these pieces sort of fit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Neighborhood group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| If we don't pay into an association and it's just a voluntary group, we're still part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| You still have to send it to them just out of courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| Is there a way to figure out if we have a neighborhood group if we don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| Yeah, we're going to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Sorry, can I ask a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| So why is the Harrington Apartments not cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| So they are – they're not really diagonal across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| But I think it's – I mean, I think it's sort of up for debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| Well, the diagonal one across the street is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| So reasonable minds can differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| So that's sort of why we want this provided on the front end with your application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| so that someone at business tax can say, hey, you mentioned this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| Yeah, look at your map and say, to err on the side of caution, why don't you notify this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| I'm already doing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| So let's hop back over to the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| Do we have to send this exact notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| Like photocopy the sheet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| And so I think what you all have been doing is like you would fill this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| and then we'll make copies of it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| And if you fill it out, then we can print copies for you while you're in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| After we've reviewed the map to see who you need to send it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| Sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| So that's super handy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Makes it easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Finding your neighborhood group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| So here's to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| On KGIS maps, and I'm not going to walk through the steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| because we've already seen where KGIS maps is and how it functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| so this is very, very similar to the steps that we just walked through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| You'll just choose a different drop-down menu and a different button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| And Debbie did print out instructions as well, so she'll pass those around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1570)|
| 0:26:19| But you can see here, so I chose the Emporium Lofts downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| You can see that they're shaded in the green there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| and the neighborhood group kind of is in bold there at the corner of Jackson and Gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| It says downtown in bold italic text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| So that is the neighborhood group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| And then to contact the neighborhood group, there's a couple ways that you can go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| I found KGIS can be a little finicky for me, but that's totally operator affairs, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1603)|
| 0:26:53| The Office of Neighborhoods does have a directory of neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| So you can go to this hyperlink here, that's where their directory is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| and it's got the contact information for all of the neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| And if you have questions about your neighborhood group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| you can go and talk to Debbie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| Her phone number is up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| Her office is on this floor just down the hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| So if there's no questions about that, we'll move on to maybe one of the most important topics, taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1639)|
| 0:27:28| Okay, so everyone who has a permit has to pay the hotel occupancy tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1648)|
| 0:27:37| Sometimes it's called the hotel motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Sometimes it's just called the occupancy tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| I put both terms up here to make it super identifiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| Under state law, I think it's called the occupancy tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| That is due to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| The rate is 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| That money goes towards paying off the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| The city is negotiating an agreement with Airbnb so that Airbnb would collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| and remit those taxes to the city of Knoxville on your behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| but we have not yet finalized that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| How many of you use platforms other than Airbnb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Do any of you cross list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Yeah, so I think then paying those taxes will be rather simple for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1702)|
| 0:28:29| once we get that agreement sorted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| Do you have any idea of time frame when that might happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| I'm hoping to hear from them in the next couple days as far as a final agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| and then as far as signing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| That takes a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| In the interim, you are responsible for this tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| and the other taxes that I'm going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| How you choose to collect and remit that is where you find that money essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| is up to you, but it is due legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| Donna can talk a little bit more about the taxes after I go through this slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| because she's really the expert on taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| Airbnb will not be collecting any taxes until you all come to an agreement, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| Sales tax is collected by the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| and that rate is set by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| Gross receipts tax is collected also by the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| but tracked using the local business license that you're going to be getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| That tax rate is also set by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Donna, do you want to talk a little bit more about these taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| and how folks would go about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| I don't know how deep you want me to get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| The occupancy taxes is the 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| The sales tax is remitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| You will register online with the state of Tennessee for your sales tax license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| and they will detail to you when that is due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| It's based off of your sales as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| That's a tax that you should be collecting on the front end and remitting to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| It's really not your tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| You're collecting it from your renter and then just forwarding it to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| Same thing as occupancy tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| The gross receipts tax is a tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| It is a very small percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| It's a fraction of a percentage on your physical gross receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| not your net, but your gross, so your gross for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| If you're grossing less than $10,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| then you will apply for a minimal activity license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| which means you really won't pay a gross receipts tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| You'll only pay $15 a year to renew that license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| because your tax would be less than $15 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| It's not a, I mean, if you're grossing millions of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| you will pay some tax, but it's not a huge tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| I want to dig deep when you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| On the hotel tax, if they're over 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| the guests, do we have to pay the tax for those guests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| If you want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| If you're over 30 days, then this doesn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Right, so it may be, there may be a circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| and this question has come up already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| where you rent sometimes for three or four days at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| but then you have somebody who wants to come and stay here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| you know, for three months as a sabbatical, you know, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| The occupancy tax is not due on anything that's over 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Under 30 or over 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Sorry, over 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Over 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| If the stay is over 30 days, occupancy tax is not due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| So the reporting form, which is not online yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| but will be shortly, will have you list your gross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| and then it has you back out any stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| For a normal hotel, motel occupancy tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| a reporting form has them list their full gross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| and then you back out any stays over 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| And so I really don't even have that form finalized yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| but probably that would be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| But typically, this permit is not for stays more than 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| But if you're doing both, if you sort of go back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| In one reporting period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| She had a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Hotel and sales tax, those are due monthly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| Quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Is it online quarterly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| The hotel tax typically is due as a monthly reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| We are discussing and will probably allow quarterly reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| only because this type of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| you're not necessarily renting every week or every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| And so it is a required reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| You have to report even a zero form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| So if the requirement is that you remit every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| and you didn't rent this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| there's no way for me to know that you just didn't fail to pay it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| unless you remit a zero form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| So in order to keep, we have discussed doing quarterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| to keep you from remitting so many zero forms if that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| A final decision hasn't been made on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| and it will be clear on your reporting form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| where they will do monthly reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| So gross receipts are yearly then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| The gross receipts are yearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| and that is based on your fiscal year of your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| So the vast majority of that is the calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| But if you tell the state that your fiscal year is different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| then they will set your reporting period at a different fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| I don't know what the sales tax is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| It depends on your type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| I think it depends on when you register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| but that is all clear when you register for your sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| your sales and use tax ID, and they'll tell you the reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| And those due dates will be fed to you through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| And so there's links here for the state sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| as far as registering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| And like Donna said, we don't have the form finalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| because everything's sort of in flux| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| until we get this agreement negotiated with Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| So when that form is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| it will be on the first link, which is our local link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| And so what she was referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| and in case this wasn't clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| so Airbnb will send us the occupancy taxes due for your rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| That's what's contemplated to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| They will send us the taxes that are due,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| but you will still have to tell us quarterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| what sort of taxes were collected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| kind of from your end of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| the dashboard that you're able to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| And that way we've got sort of numbers to back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| because Airbnb is paying the city of Knoxville in a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| They're not paying us per rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| So along with your remittance with our reporting form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| we will ask of you a summary from your Airbnb to include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| So you'll put your gross list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| back out how much of that was collected through Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| and then remit your remainder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| You may be remitting a form with no money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| if all of your rentals are through Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| But unfortunately, you will still have to submit that form to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| If you've already applied or you've already gotten your permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| and I haven't given you that reporting form yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| then we will mail it to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| or we'll make sure that you get that prior to it being due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| when it's finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| The idea is once it's finalized, as you get your permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| you will be provided the type of form that you're required to file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| and the period in which you should file it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| I have a question, Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Do we know if the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| if part of their conversation with Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| is for Airbnb to also collect sales taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| Because I think they do that some places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| I don't know if that's part of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| And so just, you know, the General Assembly is back in session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| and they are probably going to be taking up short-term rentals in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| It's sort of been an ongoing discussion as far as they're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| There was some legislation proposed last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| that just took a variety of forms over the course of the session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| But I think we can expect to see something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| We don't quite know what yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| I think sales tax, Airbnb permitting that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| But I don't know if that's part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| So I just want to mention a few other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| Rules of general applicability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| These apply to everyone regardless of what type of permit you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| You do not have to be present during the rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| but you do have to have a local agent who can be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| to respond within 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| The idea being, you know, if you're renting out your house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| and you want to go out of town for the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| that's totally acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| Some jurisdictions do have the requirement that you be present during the rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| but we did not feel that that was quite right for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| And so you don't have to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| You do have to have a local agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| There's a place on the application for you to put that person's information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| So if at any point you expect to not be present during the rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| you need to put that person's information down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| and that person will be contacted if a problem arises during a rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2264)|
| 0:37:51| The number of occupants, this is also a really important one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| So the maximum is two people per bedroom plus an additional two people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| you know, kind of with the idea that you may have a pull-out couch in the living room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| and so two people per bedroom plus an additional two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| However, there is a maximum of 12 people, and that's per fire code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| that more than 12 people essentially changes it into a different occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| per the state fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| And so 12 is the maximum number of people who can be in the unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| regardless of whether they are renting or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| So if you are there and your spouse is there, you count towards that max 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2309)|
| 0:38:38| So in that case, you could only have 10 people in your house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| provided that you had the number of bedrooms that added up to that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| for the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| Would that count if you had like a separate apartment from your house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| If you have a separate apartment and that's permitted separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| that does not count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Would that count towards children as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| Two people, one of those, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| So infants as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| Anyone who's a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| I mean, they're key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| But I think they're safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| Okay, just a couple more slides here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| Being a good neighbor, if any of you came to the public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| you know there's a lot of concern for neighborhoods about the impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| of short-term rentals, although we haven't seen a lot of impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| as far as complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| But we just want to throw this out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| that there are a few ways that you can be a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| And then some of the sort of best practices are already in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| with the neighborhood notice form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| So those include letting your neighbor know what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| and giving them your contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| So that's already taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| As far as additional things that you can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| make sure that your guests know where to park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| where to put the trash, and when to be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| Those are the big ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| That's where we expect to hear complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| So if you can address those things through house rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| I think you're sort of ahead of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| The city will be launching a 24-hour hotline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| for short-term rental complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| as part of the enforcement software that we're obtaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| We'll talk about that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| And Airbnb does have a neighbor complaint mechanism online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| And enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| So how will we deal with violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| The answer to this question depends on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| whether we're talking about permitted or unpermitted operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| So I'll start with unpermitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| because that's sort of where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| We have a lot of unpermitted operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| We are employing a software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| and essentially what it does is it looks at an Airbnb listing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| and then looks at all the other information that's available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| So tax records, property records, KBIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| all realtor listings, everything that's available online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| and makes a logical conclusion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| who owns that short-term rental unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| And then that information is provided to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| and then we use that software to follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| as far as tracking the unpermitted status of operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2472)|
| 0:41:20| We're not going to be heavy-handed right out of the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| We realize this is a new process for us and for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| So what we anticipate doing is sending out a series of letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| You know, oh, we see that you're unpermitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| Please, you know, please get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| Here's how you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| The second one may not be as nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| Eventually, it will lead to citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| which go to city court and then are appealable to circuit court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| And I think the worst-case scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| is some sort of injunction the city files against an operator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| So we expect to take sort of progressive action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| to address bad actors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| but we suspect that most people won't comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| But what if you are operating a non-owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| occupied in a residential area, and you did not apply for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| I mean, this is not me, but if someone...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| If someone were to, you know, be on there in, like, April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| they're too late to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| So do they automatically get, like, a citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| Right. They are not eligible for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| So they can't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| So that won't be a little warning here and there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| It will be a warning that says, cease operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| I mean, we'll randomly let...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| You're not authorized, you're not permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| you cannot be permitted, so cease operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| And then it will escalate in the same kind of manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| Yeah, the sort of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| The friendly progression assumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| that that person is eligible for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| If they're not eligible for a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| that may look a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| But we'll give folks the benefit of the doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| and let them know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| that they're not supposed to be doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| or that they should be doing it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| So that's what we anticipate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| If someone does have a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| so let's say you get a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| and your property is just a huge problem property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| with a lot of complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| in the ordinance we provided, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| sort of a progressive idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| in that after a certain number of complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| we'll revoke the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| And then there's an appeal for the revocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| if you feel that that is something that you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| There's a board of city staff who will hear the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| So that's how that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Are the complaints followed up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| and made sure that they're justified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| Yes, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| We're not just going to take, you know, anonymous calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| The ordinance does sort of reference, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| once a complaint is found to be valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| So, yeah, we will be investigating those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| So that's it as far as the overall presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| You have the FAQs document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| which hopefully answers other questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| If you have other questions right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| if you feel like they would be beneficial for the group to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| go ahead and pitch them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| If you want to talk to us one-on-one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| I think we can stick around for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| We really appreciate your interest in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| And if you have feedback as you go through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| Hang on just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| There is an email address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| It's strs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| so for short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| strs at Knoxville, tn.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| And that information should be on the application form as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| But if you have questions, comments, suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| please let us know because we're new at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| but we're hoping that it works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| The permit is, for a Type 1, is $70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| For a Type 2 and 3 are $120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| And then you have to get the business licenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| which are an additional $30 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2688)|
| 0:45:01| Which comes first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| Yeah, so you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| I mean, you can do it sort of all in one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| It's all on the same floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| The county business license is in the adjacent old courthouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| but it's still kind of on the same premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| So you have to show your county business license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| before I will release a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| You may come and apply for a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| and not have it finalized and complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| and be released at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| but you can apply and we'll give you the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| of kind of things you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| And then you can, as you bring things in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| or you may be very organized and have it all at once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| and then we'll issue the permit the moment we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| Yeah, so county first and second, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| Typically, it would be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| If you're trying to do it all at once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| you would want to go to the county and have that in hand, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| Yeah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| If you're applying for Type 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| what IDs are required if you're using a P.O. Box?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| Um...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| Like tax, taxes for the home, or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| Well, you have to show that you live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| So whatever documents...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| I mean, we've got the ones laid out in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| driver's license, vehicle registration, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| But they need to show that the person who's on the deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| who owns the home also lives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| And you have to provide a copy of the deed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| I think that you have been requiring that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| It says in the ordinance that a copy of the deed is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| We can pull up a copy of the deed and see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| But again, that's in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| And then you can go on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Where do I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Second floor, Register of Deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| And you can go in this building and get a copy of your deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| You can actually print a copy of your deed from KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| There is a link to the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| Oh, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| There is an instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| It doesn't always work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| Because some of those deeds are super old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Certainly, if it's a newer deed, it probably will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| But some of them don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| It doesn't always work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| But there is a link that you can click,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| and it will bring that document up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| It's an image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Usually, it's not a document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| How many IDs do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| If you have a copy of the deed, it's sufficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| The copy of the deed only shows your ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| It does not prove your residency there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| So, your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| The copies of the IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| you need two things that prove that you actually reside there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| Two documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| And there's a list of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| So, you just have to bring two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| If you want me to show you the deed option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| Let's look at somebody's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| So, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| This one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| You've got that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| So, partial details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| To pull up this box, we've got the information tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| You go here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| And then, recorded deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| And then, it downloads it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| Terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| Nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| That's an easy online way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| It seems to me that if there's need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| I feel like filing all these taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| reminders will be appreciated if a deadline is met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| Because that sounds like a lot to process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| Even once the IBM agreement is in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| you still have to be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Once you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| We believe you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| The business license is basically a registration to pay tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| So, it registers you to pay your tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| and pay several levels of tax, you'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| So, if you don't record, don't send in a filing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| we will send you a notice that says you're late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| And the state will notify you as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| that it is now time to pay your sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| You failed to pay your sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| Those type of things, you will have reminders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Now, these things are generated...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| I don't mean to sound demeaning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| but they are generated toward businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| It's not really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| So, there is a certain level of responsibility on yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| You won't be handheld through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| but you certainly...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| Reminders are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| But this is really a call to all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| who are going to operate an Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| to call our state representative and senator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| and tell them that we would like them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| to collect state taxes through Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| so we don't have to be remitting every quarter or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| So, I mean, really, literally, on KGS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| you can look up who your representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| who your state senator is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| you should call that person tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| and tell them, please make this happen this legislative session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| because the legislative session is short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| and they don't want to pass anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| because this is election year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| So, you want to make this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| you've got to tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| because if not, they're going to just pass the buck for another year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| because they don't want to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| And I would go a step further with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| to say that you should be communicating with Airbnb as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| because you are their customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| And they are not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| have not proven to be the easiest people to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| So, they certainly need to be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| I mean, I don't think I'm speaking out of line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| when I necessarily say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| So, I mean, they need to make it in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| where your legislators can follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| Can say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| So, at the bottom left-hand corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| I kept on scrolling down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| and here's all their representative information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| Does it make any difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| if two people own the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| which one of them applies to this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| Because that came up early on in the drafting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| We tweaked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| As long as one person can establish residency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| who's on the deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| that's what we are looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| I have another quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| My house, when we bought it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| was a duplex and we use it as a single residence now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| but it still has two addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| Would I be still considered owner-occupied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| Because it is one house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| We have a provision for duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| where you are allowed...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| As long as you live in one side of the duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| you're allowed to get a permit for the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| But that's just a type one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| I have a question on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| I did go through all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| to get to our neighborhood association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| which I didn't know existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| But apparently it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| But I cannot find a mailing address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| just in web page and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| Nobody has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3084)|
| 0:51:33| And while they're looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| I do want to mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| I failed to mention this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| CTV is here and they are recording this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| So if at some point you want to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| and review this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| or share it with someone who wasn't here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| it will be online in a couple days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| And we'll also post a link to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| on the city's website for the short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| If you have a business license already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| with the city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| do I have to file for another one for this, for Airbnb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| Is your business license this activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| No, it's separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| So you have to file for a separate one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| So your business license is specific to your activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| And you do have to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| if you have multiple units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| obviously not in a residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| but you have to have multiple licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| Like every Walmart has a license for every Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| So if you can be one entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| and have multiple locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| I mean, it's a separate license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| but you can still be one entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| What came up was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| there's an email address and a phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| My first suggestion was you could call her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| and get an address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| But then I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| can you just email?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| And then you have a record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| that you notified them via email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| Is that acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| I think that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| And attach the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| This is maybe a very paranoid question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| but I noticed you used the word natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| at some point in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| That's not a reference to citizenship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| That's just that you're a human being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| That's all this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| Where do you find the five forms of ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| To find twos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| They're in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| and they're also in footnote five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| on your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| It's actually like a checklist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| on your application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| of all the things you need to have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| before you sign it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop180109ShortTermRentalWorkshop?start=3206)|
