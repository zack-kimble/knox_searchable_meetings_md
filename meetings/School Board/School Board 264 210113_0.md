| 0:02:54| Also, as we discussed at our work session, item 7A was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=174)|

| 0:04:03| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| We have a motion by Ms. Christie, a second by Mr. McMillan. Discussion? All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| Item 6A, approved second reading of Knox County Board of Education Policy J201, random searches for dangerous weapons as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=254)|
| 0:04:24| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| We have a motion by Ms. Christie, a second by Mr. McMillan. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Thank you, Madam Chair. Superintendent Thomas, can you let us know about any result or anything that's happened related to this policy related to procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=273)|
| 0:04:46| Yes, sir. Madam Chair, members of the board, of course, second reading of the policy, but we have developed procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=286)|
| 0:04:54| administrative procedures for ensuring that the random search will be random.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| That's online. If you were to go to the Knox County Schools website and look under Board of Education and then you can find administrative procedures and click on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=299)|
| 0:05:09| You can find that policy, our procedure. It's J-201 and basically just to talk a little bit about what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=309)|
| 0:05:18| They will be scheduled, the search is scheduled in advance with principal approval. Also, the director of schools must approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| They'll be supervised by a sergeant or a more senior supervisor assigned to the school security division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=324)|
| 0:05:32| There will be an appropriate number of security officers there to complete the search at the start of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=332)|
| 0:05:40| It will be videotaped and archived. Also, the school resource officer for that school will not be directly participating in the search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=340)|
| 0:05:51| The randomness will be based on the volume of students entering the school building, but we will have enough personnel there to start to do the search and then begin the school day on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=351)|
| 0:06:03| Again, depending on the number of students, the number might be every 6th student or 10th student or 15th student, just to ensure the randomness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=363)|
| 0:06:12| I know I didn't ask for that, but just for the public to understand that we do have procedures in place to ensure that this is a random search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=372)|
| 0:06:20| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| All members in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=389)|

| 0:09:52| Okay. Thank you, Ms. Coney. Did you want to just go ahead and hear from Mr. Superintendent Thomas or did you have a question? Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=592)|
| 0:10:02| Thank you, Madam Chair and board members. Talk a little bit about the change. What this means for Knox County Schools means very little different from what we've been doing in the fall semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=602)|
| 0:10:13| Just wanted to assure parents in the community that we will continue contact tracing our nurses. Our school nurses were heavily involved in that process in the fall and will continue to be heavily involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=613)|
| 0:10:26| Many times we actually knew about active cases even prior to the health department because of folks who were so diligent about self-reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=626)|
| 0:10:37| Again, don't anticipate a whole lot of change for us in terms of what the health department has announced. I know they're focusing more on the vaccine at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=637)|
| 0:10:48| It could mean that our numbers might be a little bit higher than even the county numbers from time to time based on the fact that we're contact tracing and the health department is not contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=648)|
| 0:11:00| Just really wanted to say, too, from the standpoint of our in-person enrollment today, I know we've been back in school. This is the second week back in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=660)|
| 0:11:11| I'm not saying all 44,180 students were present today, but we did offer in-person instruction to 44,000 of our students today, which I think is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=671)|
| 0:11:26| Again, I said last week and I'll say this week, kudos to our teachers and our principals and our school staffs for doing an amazing job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=686)|
| 0:11:34| We continue to work with the health department. Our HR department and our health services department communicate daily, multiple times a day sometimes, in terms of making sure that the information we have recorded is accurate and we're on top of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=694)|
| 0:11:52| We also continue to work with the health department. I know Jason and Dr. Reiswick are in communication on a regular schedule basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=712)|
| 0:12:03| In addition, if there are situations that come up in between, we continue to work with our health department and they've been extremely supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=723)|
| 0:12:13| We're also working on a plan in terms of vaccination. The next step for us over the next few days, we will be sending a survey out to our employees, to all staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=733)|
| 0:12:25| Know that the vaccination is not mandatory, but certainly would encourage all staff to think about taking that vaccine when it's offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=745)|
| 0:12:35| Also, we're working on a plan, working with the health department. Right now, we know that what we do know, and this is not definite, but what we've been told is it might be late February, early March before the vaccines are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=755)|
| 0:12:49| My hope is we'll get a phone call way before then to say that, hey, we've got vaccines and we're ready to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=769)|
| 0:12:57| We'll continue to work with the health department. The survey for employees would be just to let us know, hey, I want to take the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=777)|
| 0:13:05| This will help us, once it does become available, help us with the distribution process in terms of administering the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=785)|
| 0:13:14| Again, partnering with the health department. Talked to Dr. Joe Childs at Children's Hospital. I know Children's Hospital is possibly going to work with us in terms of administering that vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=794)|
| 0:13:28| We'll continue to have those conversations and hopefully be ready as soon as the vaccines are made available for us to get started with the administration of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=808)|
| 0:13:41| Any questions? Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thanks, Superintendent Thomas. I do have a couple follow-up questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| With the vaccine, do we have any sense that there's going to be a possibility that that can be done for teachers in the context of schools, or has that not been a part of the conversation yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=828)|
| 0:13:59| That's a little bit early in the conversation with that. I know the problem is in terms of us being able with the storage and keeping the vaccines and those certain temperatures have to be maintained for the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=839)|
| 0:14:12| Once it's out, I think you've got a certain amount of time in order to get that administered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| It's probably going to be best for us. We'll still work out those logistics, but for the folks that are capable of handling that to be the ones to administer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=857)|
| 0:14:29| Again, we'll work in partnership with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| Thank you. Just one more question. I'm just going to read this because it's a little bit, just the way I worded it, I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=871)|
| 0:14:41| With the self-reporting, one of the things that I've been curious about, and I think we've done a great job as a school system, and I really applaud Lisa and the staff across our district, especially in supporting the health department in all those actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=881)|
| 0:14:57| I also know that the virus is wearing thin on all of us, and I'm curious if there's been any conversation or concern about relying on self-reporting as we move forward in terms of our metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=897)|
| 0:15:12| Is there concern that our data will not be as good from people just choosing not to self-report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=912)|
| 0:15:20| I know that's an open-ended question, and I know there's no definite response to that, but I guess so many of our metrics are really dependent on that information, and I'm just curious if there's been internal conversations about that in terms of self-reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=920)|
| 0:15:35| We've had those conversations, and again, just looking back at what happened in the fall, the vast majority of the information that we did receive was through self-reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=935)|
| 0:15:46| So we don't anticipate that not continuing, but we'll continue to watch that in addition to the metrics that we do watch to looking at the substitute rate, our attendance rate for teachers, looking at that seven-day average and just tracking the numbers each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=946)|
| 0:16:07| Certainly, we've seen an increase, but I'm not sure it has risen to the level that maybe folks anticipated it going to rise to at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=967)|
| 0:16:18| Now, tomorrow, the next day, it could be much higher, but I'm hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| I think it appears that maybe it's not going to be as bad at this point as people maybe predicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=985)|
| 0:16:32| Again, the numbers are still high, so we don't anticipate that it's going to be a problem, but I don't know if Jason or John, if either one of y'all have anything to add to that, welcome it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=992)|
| 0:16:47| If not, that's the best answer we have at this point, unless y'all want to add something to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1007)|
| 0:16:55| I think you're right. We anticipate it will continue to contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1015)|
| 0:17:03| But we will appreciate the questions and we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| We meet every day to look. We're in constant conversation with principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| Obviously, they are there and on-site, and if there are issues that get close to where we need to have more conversation, I know our grade-level directors are talking to our principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1032)|
| 0:17:24| and we're meeting on a daily basis and sometimes twice a day, depending on what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| So we're going to just continue to do what we did in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| We feel like we had really great success with that and we plan to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| I appreciate that. I know what I've just been hearing in the community is just, in some groups, a heightened anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1060)|
| 0:17:48| I think it's important when people see something as public as what the health department has done to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| hey, it's time for us to refocus on vaccinations and stop contact tracing, which is obviously the move that they need to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| I think people automatically start asking, well, what ripple effect is that going to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| Ultimately, what I want people to understand is what you're saying is that it's going to have very little effect on us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| without saying that that's the assumption people make, is it's going to have this effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| I appreciate you clarifying and restating what we've been holding to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| Yes, sir. Thank you for that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| I just want to say, too, to our parents and to our students and our staff that are so diligent with the masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| wearing the masks and hand-washing and sanitizing high-touch areas and staying home when sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| I really feel like that's had a tremendous impact on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| I don't know where everyone is individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| There's probably still going to be a couple of few months that we've got to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| But with the vaccination, I'm very optimistic that we can hopefully be back to some sense of normalcy in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1131)|
| 0:19:01| Again, we're going to work and do our part and just appreciate our parents and our students for adhering to the protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1141)|
| 0:19:10| And I really think that's what's having such a positive effect for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| So I just want to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| In giving your information, you mentioned the word children's hospital and vaccinations in the same sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1161)|
| 0:19:30| And I heard you say that you were in reference to our staff and employees being vaccinated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| but I just didn't want social media to take it and run with it and us to have a PR nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| So we're not â€“ your children's hospital is just coming alongside possibly to help administer to our staff and adult employees, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1181)|
| 0:19:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| They've got experience in that process and the ability to make sure that the integrity of the vaccine is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1191)|
| 0:20:00| So we're talking adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| I just wanted to make sure no one misheard that that was listed online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| And also, Superintendent Thomas, our employees will not be required to take the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| You may have said that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| We're not mandating that everyone take the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| My hope is that folks will participate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| I know people are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Obviously, we want to take every step that we can possibly take in order to make sure that our employees are safe and our students are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1226)|
| 0:20:33| So I would encourage our folks, our employees, just to give it very serious consideration and make their decision, but we're not going to force it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1233)|
| 0:20:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| And just on this topic of contact tracing, I would be remiss if I didn't note that I continue to speak to parents on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1244)|
| 0:20:53| about their concern with healthy children being quarantined, the fact that students are wearing their masks diligently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1253)|
| 0:21:00| Quarantining has never included all parties wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| So I know I brought this up in an earlier meeting, and I continue to believe that we're quarantining too many healthy children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1264)|
| 0:21:12| Studies show that children are not passing the virus at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| They're much more likely to get it outside of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| And so I continue to hear from school personnel as well as parents who are concerned that we're continuing to quarantine too many healthy children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1281)|
| 0:21:30| So I just need to make sure that we recognize that there are differences of opinion on that topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1290)|
| 0:21:38| So with that, we will move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Our first speaker tonight is Avery Flatford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| Avery Flatford here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1311)|
| 0:21:58| Thank you, Ms. Flatford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| Ms. Flatford, if you can state your name for the record and also your county of residence, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| My name is Avery Flatford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| Thank you for giving me a few minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| My name is Avery Flatford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| I'm a junior at Farragut High School, class of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| I'm here to speak on behalf of all Knox County school athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| I'm not here to recite any numbers or give any data points about the COVID trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| I'm here as a student athlete to give you a face with reality of where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| We're living in a very challenging time, an uncertain time that has quick and drastic changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| As a student, we are expected to accept those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| And I'm speaking on all of spring sports to say that we are not okay with those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| Many of us, if not all of us, have seen the effects of COVID firsthand with our families, friends, and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| Just a few weeks ago, I lost my great-grandmother to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| Our holidays have been altered so we know and understand that this is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| We also know that now is the time to speak up before it's too late to advocate for us students, student athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1386)|
| 0:23:14| Last month, the Board of Health, originally recommended to the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| encouraged not to allow spring extracurricular activities, but was changed to limit extracurricular activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1398)|
| 0:23:25| to say not allow spring sports extracurricular activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| Three months before the season starts is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| Seeing that made my stomach drop. I remember the tears of my shortstop, Bailey Myers, crying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| To the hurt of my catcher, Katie Tuggle, Abigail Green, our senior pitcher who had worked to have her time on the mound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| It was taken shortly after the season started last spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| This should be a choice for each player to make their own decisions with their family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| and be supported by their teammates and coaches if a player chooses not to play for safety reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| But most of us are competitors. We live to compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| Our last game should be holding up a state trophy that we worked so hard for, dreamed of as a child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| or hugging our teammates and coaches because we lost our season or playing days are over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| It should not be another lighting of the field for 21 minutes to honor the seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| We live for the moment of playing our rivals, bus rides the nerves throughout the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| of competing that night, picking up our teammates and when they are struggling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| hugging our parents after the games are matched and hearing them say they are proud of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| or you'll get them next time, or smiling at the little girl or boy who is practicing in the backyard to be just like you one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| If our spring is canceled again, many seniors will not have a next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| Most will not go and play in college. Prior to COVID, 1 in 13 athletes went to play college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| With NCAA allowing an additional year to college players,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| that means even less high school seniors and now juniors will be recruited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| Every game played is an opportunity to be seen and maybe play at the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| It's a chance to pursue that dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| We watched this past fall as our high school teams took the field for football and soccer with great precautions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| We will take those same precautions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| With less fans, only parents and cheerleaders or students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| our basketball friends are playing but missing a supportive student section and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| We are missing another memory, making experiences with our classmates in the stands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| or cheering our friends playing the game they love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| I missed supporting my friends. That was important for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| For as long as I can remember, I have always had to take precautions to protect myself from being sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| I live every day with cystic fibrosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| So yes, I'm standing here potentially a high risk for COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| My parents have always let me live my life to the fullest, including going to school in person this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| All my coaches have never held me to a lesser standard because of my disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| Playing soccer at a high level throughout the United States has kept me out of the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| Due to my successes, I am able to have the opportunity to be the first D1 pitcher with cystic fibrosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| I'm going to be playing at Tennessee Tech on scholarship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| Right now, many Knox student-athletes are getting ready for a spring season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| with goals of being the last team in person and standing in Murfreesboro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| myself and my lady Admirals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| COVID rules are honestly holding me back more than my CF has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| I went to PT for sixâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| So I'm here on behalf of all my rivals and friends throughout Knox County to let us play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| I ask leaders of each team to be an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| Wear your mask. Wash your hands constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| Stay home if you are not feeling well. Social distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| Talk to your teams and have them on board, whatever it takes for all of us to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Thank you for your time and allowing me to speak on behalf of hundreds of Knox County school student-athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1615)|
| 0:27:04| Thank you, Ms. Flatford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| Madam Chair, our next speaker is Betsy Hobkirk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1630)|
| 0:27:25| Thank you, Ms. Hobkirk. If you can state your name and your county of residence, and then you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1645)|
| 0:27:37| Thank you. My name is Betsy Hobkirk. I live in Knoxville, Tennessee, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| I'm a teacher at West Hills Elementary, and I wanted to talk to you about possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1664)|
| 0:27:53| I won't go through statistics. We all know what's going on in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| But I'm feelingâ€”and I'm feeling an increased number of people around me, my fellow colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| that things are kind of converging right now to be risky in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| And I wouldâ€”I really feel, while I am optimistic about the vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| we know that the immunity from the vaccine really won't kick in until February, March, at the earliest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1698)|
| 0:28:28| It takes a while. You receive the vaccine, but it takes time before we get the positive effects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| And I would like to encourage this body to really consider going virtual until we vaccinate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1714)|
| 0:28:45| or some kind of predictable hybrid schedule to reduce the number of students in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| We alsoâ€”I've been working with a group of teachers and parents to think about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| and to also think about community learning pods, because to support parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| we know that this has been a huge hardship on parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| We have the great schools partnerships, PTO, PTA, YMCA, churches, community centers, libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| It could be access to support us to reduce the number of students that are currently in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| At my school, we currently do have a YMCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| And when we went red, they did do inâ€”they did do virtual teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| They supported our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| When their staff were exposed to COVID and they had to shut down, they then moved to a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| So those networks are there, and I think they need to be strengthened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| I saw firsthand how that was possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| I think it's time to get more flexible and creative with how we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| and we really need the community with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| I feel like the schools have kind of been tasked with keeping things going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| with keeping the economy going, with supporting parents to be able to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| And I think more entities need to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| We know that there's $50 million that has recently been received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| and a huge chunk of that could go towards supporting virtual learners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| So the things thatâ€”the reasonâ€”the reason that I think we need to be more flexible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| is I keep seeing more evidence of kind of the same old, same old thinking as if we're not in a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1823)|
| 0:30:31| We know there is a sub-shortage, and to cope with that, teachersâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| and to cope with that, when teachers are out due to quarantine or illness, classes are being collapsed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| which leads to crowding and makes it more difficult or impossible to socially distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| which we know is essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| Masking is inconsistent in different schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| It's enforced more vigorously in some places than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| Some teachers feel like they don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| the backing of the people they need to have the backing from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| to make sure that their students continue to mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| And evenâ€”students who even have the good intentions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| and in places where you do have a strong administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| there's a lot of this, and there's a lot of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| Like, unaware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| You know, I spend a lot of time asking my students to show me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| how do you wear yourâ€”how do you wear your mask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1883)|
| 0:31:30| When students are in the hallway, they're shoulder to shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| We have evidence of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| Weâ€”and parents are disheartened when they see students playing outside during recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| Community members can see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| where students are playing really closely together without their mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| And as a teacher, I totally understand that kids need a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| We know there's a custodial shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Contact tracing is being decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| Days to be quarantined are decreasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| There's a more contagious COVID variant moving into the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| So, I just feel like we need toâ€”I don't have this rosy, optimistic outlook right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1926)|
| 0:32:16| I feel like there's a lot of things that are converging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| that are actually making the situation more urgent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| And I would like us to be more flexible in how we goâ€”what we do in these next two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| I think, are actually critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| I don't feel safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| A lot of my fellow teachers don't feel safe in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| So, I don't know what information you're getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| but I think you need to maybe dig a little bit deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| Thank you, Ms. Hofkirk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| And, Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| Thank you, Ms. Coney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| Okay, we'll move to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| Anything from Ms. Satterfield, Ms. Owen, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| One of the things I was reminded this week when I was in a number of different calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1984)|
| 0:33:13| with organizations that come along, especially the most vulnerable in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| you know, for a few years as a community, we've kind of highlighted this idea of being trauma-informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| and being trauma-responsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| You know, I know Knox County Schools has done a lot of work in that amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| being culturallyâ€”through our Office of Culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| But the interesting thing about the COVID pandemic to me is that it's this universally traumatic event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2015)|
| 0:33:44| And all of us experience trauma in significantly different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| But all of us have experienced loss to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| I was just talking to another school board member right before this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| who didn't get to celebrate Christmas the way they would normally have, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| And it's that thing that binds us at this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| that we're all experiencing this and going through it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| But I've also seen in that, that like any trauma, people react to traumas very, very differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| And one of the things that I would want to advocate for in our community, in our families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| in the places that we visit, is for people to be more sensitive to the way people are responding to this trauma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| and allowing for people the space to respond to that in the way that they need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| More than anything right now, we need more grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| It doesn't mean that we don't need good thinking and we don't need strategy and we don't need all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| We need all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| But we also need a significant amount of grace because for the first time in my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| I'm going through a trauma with 400,000 other people in Knox County at the same time, a traumatic event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| And all of us know that like any traumatic event, there's going to be things that come out of this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| that end up impacting other parts of our life in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| And again, I don't say that as a doomsday sayer or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| I just want us to call it what it is and acknowledge that we're all moving through a really unique event in life right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2108)|
| 0:35:16| And if anything, we need some grace so we can move through that well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| Okay. Ms. Lee, Ms. Christie, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2122)|
| 0:35:32| I know we talked about this, the Superintendent did, but I would encourage staff if you're at least 40 or older,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2132)|
| 0:35:48| I would encourage you to take the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| Now, obviously I'm going to take it because of age, but one of my doctors convinced me a couple weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2152)|
| 0:36:02| when he said that technically his wife didn't fall into any of the early categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2162)|
| 0:36:11| And I didn't ask how old she was, but she has to be in her late 30s or early 40s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| because they have children that are in middle school and early high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| And his very words to me were, she would kill for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| So all the people in that group, all the doctors took it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| but he was surprised that not too many of the staff members took it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| You know, it was optional just like it is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| But I would encourage anybody that if you have a chance to take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2204)|
| 0:36:52| think seriously about taking it for your benefit as well as others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2212)|
| 0:36:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Thank you, Ms. Bounds. Ms. Henderson? Mrs. Henderson? No? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| I'll just say I would like to commend the Superintendent for just the difficult work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| and being able to keep students in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| And as our student who spoke, spoke so eloquently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| thank you, Avery, for coming to speak to us and just reminding us that students need normalcy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| and they need life to be as normal as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| And I agree, Mr. Thomas, that we can see the light at the end of the tunnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| and I'm hoping that by the time we get back to fall, we can be looking at a much more normal situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| That's what our kiddos need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| and we need to remember we're doing all this for the benefit of the education of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| So thank you again to all the teachers who are making that happen and all of our staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| And that concludes our meeting. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210113?start=2274)|
