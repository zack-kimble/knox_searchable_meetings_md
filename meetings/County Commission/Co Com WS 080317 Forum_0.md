| 0:00:43| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=43)|
| 0:00:44| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| We have 12 commissioners present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=45)|
| 0:00:49| First I want to start off by thanking all the commissioners for going out to the green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=49)|
| 0:00:53| waste facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| The majority of us did go out and see firsthand what was going on, so I appreciate that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=54)|
| 0:01:03| Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=63)|
| 0:01:04| Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| Before we get started, I'd like to let Matt Minofo know what needs to address the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=65)|
| 0:01:11| briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| I'm Matt Minofo, contracts coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=73)|
| 0:01:18| We released a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| Could you get your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| 1917 Trent Valley Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| And what was the name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| Minofo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| Matt Minofo, M-U-N-A-F-O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| We released a new request for proposal back on March 12th of last week, and there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| no contact policy within all of our solicitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| I just wanted to address and reiterate it in this case, since this does kind of flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| over into the new contract itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=105)|
| 0:01:48| The no contact policy states, after the date and time the proposer receives this solicitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=108)|
| 0:01:54| any contact initiated by any proposer with any Knox County representative other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| a purchasing division representative listed herein concerning this RFP is strictly prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=118)|
| 0:02:05| Any such unauthorized contact may cause the disqualification of any proposer from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| procurement transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=130)|
| 0:02:12| An affidavit may be required in regards to this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| Again, we just want to reiterate this one real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| It does include everybody, elected officials, appointed officials, anybody within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| So all questions regarding the new RFP shall come through myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| When you say no contact, what are you saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| We can't go out to the facility now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| You cannot talk about the new request for proposal, the new contract that will be upcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| So there's definitely a fine line between the new contract and what it states in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| After July 1st, this one will be in place most likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| Does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Matt, is that standard policy in all of our proposals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| That is standard policy within all of our solicitations, bids, and proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| So we can't talk to people about the actual mulching or just can't talk about the Pacific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=184)|
| 0:03:11| of what they're proposing in the bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| What they're proposing in the bid, the current contract is up for discussion, but anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| in their proposal, this goes up to the date and the award is extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| But you can have a conversation with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| You just can't talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| CLO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Mr. Chairman, we've handed out a couple of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| One is a timeline on the organic waste processing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| Also you received a memo from John McConkie that summarizes Natural Resources Recovery's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| contract with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| What I'm going to do is I'm going to get right to the heart of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| You all have been here a long time, and I appreciate you all's time right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| Essentially several months ago, I was made aware of a revenue share provision in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| contract that Knox County wasn't collecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| At the time, John Evans was Director of Solid Waste, and for those that don't know, John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| Evans passed away unexpectedly in October of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| When I found out about the revenue share provision in the contract and the fact that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| not collecting this revenue share, I sat down with John and discussed the matter with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| And what I'm getting ready to tell you, first off, I'm in total agreement with what John's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| evidence decision in not collecting this revenue share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| The one thing that John should have done, though, he should have brought that part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| that contract should have been brought back before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| Essentially what we talked about is four points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| The first of which involves the facility as the proposed bidders viewed the facility before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| they submitted their RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| The facility had quite a bit of mulch on the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| The proposers were led to believe that that mulch would be there when they took over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Hence, Natural Resource Recovery, when they built their business plan, it was with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| understanding that they would be starting with some product out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| Now, that is not part of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| It is part of the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| Also, Knox County was going to provide a second facility at the Forkster River Industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| Park for them to do organics processing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| That has not happened and will not happen, and that's for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| We set aside money for us to develop a site at Forkster River Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| However, we experienced difficulties with the Solway facility in these retention ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| that are required as part of our permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| Our permit for composting requires that we collect all the stormwater runoff and essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| retain it on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| So, it requires what's referred to as a retention basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| Unfortunately, these basins, when they were built, sinkholes developed in the bottom of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| these basins unexpectedly, and we required that Knox County come in and make corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| to those retention basins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| In doing so, the money that we would have used essentially at Forkster River had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| be diverted to Solway to correct those detention basin deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| The second reason we have not pursued a permit at the Forkster River is because we are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| dealing with odor complaints at our existing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| I didn't feel it was wise for us to open yet a second facility until we get a handle on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| the odor complaints we're receiving at Solway, so we never intended at that point to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| with a site out at Forkster River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| Keeping in mind, I think we projected the cost share revenue that the county would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| brought in with natural resource recovery is around $140,000 over a five-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=396)|
| 0:06:43| I would have had to have spent probably $250,000 in order to get the Forkster River site up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| to a site that could be permitted and licensed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| The third problem that we encountered was the odor complaints that we received out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| That required that Knox County essentially adjust some of the waste streams that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| coming in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| Here again, that affected natural resources recovery's bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| When we had to cut out these waste source, they essentially lost revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| How much revenue, I can't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| Probably the main reason that this revenue share wasn't collected was in our RFP, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| projected the first year that you would bring in approximately 15,000 tons of green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| That projection fell short of about 4,000 tons in the first year, but more telling was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| in our RFP, we predicted that that green waste would not only double but triple in the coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Quite frankly, that never happened, and I think that's probably the largest reason why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| we never pursued this revenue share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| Now, having said all that, and I also urge you go through Mr. McConkie's memo, he goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| into actually more detail than I am here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| When I sat down with John and this was explained to me, and I have since looked into it even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| further, I have no problem whatsoever with John's decision not to collect the revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| What I do feel like should have happened is we should have come back before commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| and made the necessary contract revisions in order to set this essentially straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| Not only in regards to the revenue share, but also in regards to the requirement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| Knox County obtain a permit that forks the River Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| So that's really it, quite frankly, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| That's what I've been able to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| That's what I've spent some time doing and reviewing, the numbers that have been submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| to the county and the logic behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| I guess at the end of the day, what I'm saying is Mr. Evans made the right decision for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| right reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| However, it should have come back to commission for commission's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| Bruce, it started with the first thing that you said was that I guess natural resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| were promised stockpiles of mulch that they could sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=532)|
| 0:09:00| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Is that in the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| And let me make a clear distinction here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| There are things that we took in consideration, and we're not attorneys, but what we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| doing here was they were led to believe, or they were left with this impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| There's a difference between what our legal obligation was with natural resource recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| and what we led them to believe, and we didn't do so unknowingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| It's just that in the RFP, we made these predictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| So when they built their business plan, they built their business plan relying on our predictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| Now, my opinion, you go to a court, the court's going to say, well, that's too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| We didn't view it as that's too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| We felt like that was being somewhat misleading or unfair, not knowingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| But we felt that that was a significant contribution to why we should not collect this revenue share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| Is it legally binding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| But I think it was the appropriate thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| It was certainly the fair thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| Because I'm looking at a contract here, and I don't know where it came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| It says on item 25, it is agreed that the contract represents the entire contract between the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| And there's no prior representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| Promises or agreements, oral or otherwise, shall be of any force or effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| Signed by the mayor and Sidney Brine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| And here again, I'm not here to really discuss, I mean, to argue legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| Clearly in the RFP and in their meetings with the solid waste staff, they were told, and the RFP says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| The RFP says 15,000 tons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| Essentially we're estimating 15,000 tons, and we're predicting that to double and triple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| Is that binding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| No, sir, it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| But I think in John Evans, and certainly after I discussed it with John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| I felt the fair thing to do was when you factor in that and all these others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| was quite frankly was to forego the $1.50 a cubic yard revenue share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Have you looked back at the budget that John, I guess, would put together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| Talk about revenue coming in and what his expenditures were that owned this natural resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| whatever would be coming into Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| He budgeted zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| Before any agreement for him to forego the $1.50 was ever on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=673)|
| 0:11:21| So why would he budget something that was the largest contract for solid waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| the largest deal solid waste has ever made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| and even in the first year before any of these deals were made, they didn't have no revenue coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| I can only guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| I guess that's a question that's going to have to go unanswered because the person that answers is no longer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| Well, then when someone does the budget, he has to turn it in to someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| You send it on up, I guess, on up the steps of the ladder so nobody ever caught it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=708)|
| 0:11:57| Well, I don't know if it's a matter of catching it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| I just don't know what the rationale behind it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| It could have been he may have decided to err on the side of caution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| assuming zero revenue for the first year until they actually know exactly what's transpiring out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| It's probably a safer thing to do than to put a dollar amount thinking we're going to get this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| and proceed to spend money with things coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| Well, if you've got a contract for $1.50 a yard, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| surely you would have thought you'd sell two or three yards and put $4 in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=739)|
| 0:12:25| The number I've seen for their first year in sales was 70 cubic yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| So we probably would have got in $100, $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| So I'm only saying that I think John, quite frankly, didn't know what that number was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| Err on the side of caution, put zero in, and proceed from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| And then after the first year, he wouldn't have known going forward and budgeted a zero again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| I think one thing to point out is all this didn't happen at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| This was a progression of factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| The first factor certainly was the absence of a product up there that they were able to sell, i.e.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| the site was essentially stripped clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| And then these other factors came in, such as not being able to provide a facility for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| at the Forks of the River Industrial Park, the factors of modifying the waste stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| and the additional factor of our predictions of green waste didn't really hold true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| This didn't all happen at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| It was a progression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| And here again, after reviewing it, I completely concur with his recommendation or his actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=804)|
| 0:13:32| other than the fact he should have brought it back here for contract modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| Okay, let's get to the bond for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| The bond was, is it released?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| Missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Yeah, the bond, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| Actually, we required a bond, and I may be wrong about the term of the bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| and Percy might have to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| But the bond was released, but it was not released until at least after the first year of performance up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| The bond was in place to make sure I didn't have some fly-by-night operation go up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| and stick us with a mess that the county would have to clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| After they demonstrated their ability to perform, or at least our fears were alleviated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| that this was not a fly-by-night operation, the purchasing department had the authority to release the bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| and they did so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| Okay, the contract was signed like 11-7 of 02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| So you're saying the bond stayed in effect for a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| That is my understanding, but to be just on the side of caution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| Matt Minifoe may need to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| And then in the contract, on number 12, it says that the bond shall be maintained through June 30, 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=870)|
| 0:14:38| That's the earliest this bond could have been released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| Like I said, Commissioner, I knew it was in place for at least a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| Beyond that, I couldn't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| But Mr. Minifoe might have to answer that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Could he have documentation where somebody released it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| Like I said, that's something you have to ask Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| Bring him on up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| Commissioner, I do not have any documentation in regards to releasing the performance bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| So what happened to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| I cannot speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| I mean, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| Is the bond a piece of paper that we would physically have in our hand in Knox County Government at purchasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=912)|
| 0:15:19| Not necessarily at purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| It could be in the user department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| But it is a piece of paper that we would physically have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| And do we have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| The purchasing division does not have the copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| Do you know if it exists in Knox County Government somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| At this point, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| No, sir, you don't know or no, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| It does not exist at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| It was released at one time, but the purchasing division did not release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| So do we have a letter or how does it get released?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| Does somebody release it and have a letter sent from either Bruce's people or the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=949)|
| 0:15:57| Who releases them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Typically the user department makes that judgment at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| Then they get in contact with us to let us know that they are not going to require the performance bond to go longer in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| And do we have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| So we don't have a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| We don't have the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| We don't know who released it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| But we know the bond is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| I think that's all I have for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Yes, Mr. Torrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| This is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=992)|
| 0:16:42| It's hard for me to sit up here and believe we don't have any more control over our finances in this county than we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| We do not have an accounts receivable line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| For this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| No, for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| We do have accounts receivable lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| Well, when we issue a contract and we lease people property out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| and they're supposed to pay us so much a month or so much like this natural resource here for the merchandise that they sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1025)|
| 0:17:15| why did we not have one for these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| We may still have people out here that are on leases and not paying us or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| Somebody can just go down there and say, hey, you don't have to pay this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| Don't we have any way of keeping this checked, check and balanced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| I think that Mr. Weitrick addressed this a little bit, is that we didn't know what the volume was going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| and so we didn't know what the amounts were going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| Well, we're talking about from 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| Now, the only thing I'm interested in is the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| Knox County was supposed to have gotten some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| Now, if you can prove to me why they weren't, that's all right with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| I'm not interested in anything else out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| I know people are talking about arsenic, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| I haven't seen any reports or anything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| But I'm wondering why that when Knox County grants a contract, whether it's leasing property or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| that we have money to use that the finance department does not set up accounts receivable for when we're due money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1083)|
| 0:18:11| We do have several accounts receivable for several different contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| In this particular case, we didn't know what the volume, the number of cubic yards were going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| so we didn't know or weren't able to put down a definitive number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| But we still should have had a contracts receivable item form, line form, shouldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| Without an amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Without an amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| But if it went on from 2003 to 2007 and no money had come in, would you not have questioned that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1113)|
| 0:18:40| Why do we have a line item here for them, accounts receivable item form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| They're not paying anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| In retrospect, that would have been helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| One of the things that we want to do is on our budgets we try to be conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| and not count on money that's not coming in either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| Are you filling in for the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| I want to make a recommendation that any time we do business with this county, anybody does business with this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1146)|
| 0:19:15| that we either grant them a lease or are contracting with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| there's money to be coming into this county, that the finance department be notified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| there be something set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| and maybe they need to start giving us a report every month on how much money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| who we're to collect money from and if it's coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| We've got to gain some kind of control over our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| Now, we sit up here, we raise the taxes, we disperse the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| It's being misused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| This commission doesn't want to do anything about it, but it's our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| That's our number one responsibility as a county commissioner is take care of the people's tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| So I want this put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| I don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| I'm not a lawyer or an accountant, neither one, but I did run a business a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| When somebody owed me money, the first thing our bookkeeper did was put it down there that they owed us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| And if it wasn't coming in, we called them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| But I just don't understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1218)|
| 0:20:25| The gentleman was from the purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Matt Monathoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| Matt, a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| I have run purchasing departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| and I guess one of the questions I have is that whether if one of my employees issued a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1238)|
| 0:20:46| and I'm trying to figure out how you guys do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| When we issued a contract in that department and we oversaw $500 million, $600 million worth of purchases a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1250)|
| 0:20:58| whoever issued that contract was responsible for it from birth to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| Is that the way that Knox County runs a contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| It may differ between the stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| It is determined by the workload that we maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| For instance, I used to purchase for the Parks and Recreation Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| I no longer purchase for them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| So it does shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Depending on the size of the department, number of contracts that we have, we do shift duties around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| Okay, but I guess there's someone there that would have picked up this particular contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1292)|
| 0:21:39| and would have continued to monitor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| I mean, there's someone who's responsible for each contract that's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| Commissioner, essentially once they're heavily involved in the bidding process, the contract writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| essentially once this contract was executed and awarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| it was really John's responsibility to oversee the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| and make sure the provisions of the contract were met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| And here again, in response to Commissioner Pinkston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| one point I'm trying to make here is that regardless of what John did or didn't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| what I'm saying is he made the right decision here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| The county was not in compliance with the contract either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| And in order to write everything, to get it in compliance, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| I would have been at the end of the day, the county would have been spending more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| getting in compliance with the contract than we would have been collecting the revenue share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| Now, that's just the fact of the matter is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| But that's where the ball's down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| It would have been very helpful had John come to me early on and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| hey, we've got some problems here with this revenue share and we've got these types of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| I would have had it back before commission essentially immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| and we wouldn't be having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| But having backtracked this and looked at everything that's transpired, I still say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| John made certainly the right decision, and I'm saying that again today for probably the third time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| made the right decision in doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| He went about it clearly the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| Do we have anything in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Commissioner Pinkston brought up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| Do we have anything in place today that keeps this from happening going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1393)|
| 0:23:21| not just on this particular contract, but, guys, do you know of anything that we've got in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| to make sure that this doesn't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| Because, again, my departments, we always had checks and balances, you know, that if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1409)|
| 0:23:36| and everyone knew that if there's a change in a contract for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| because actually if there's a change in a contract and it hasn't been taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| then it actually becomes null and void with penalties to different parties based upon why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1424)|
| 0:23:52| and how that was violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| And I'm not saying that natural resources is anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| I'm just trying to get a grasp on all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| After the contract has been executed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| we lay the responsibility back onto the user department at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| If there is a problem with it that does occur, if an addendum needs to be made to the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| it does flow back through our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Likewise with any purchases through a contract, it comes through us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| So the responsibility, when it comes down to the contract itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| we really let the user department maintain that ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| My concern with this is, and I'm, like Mr. Pinkston, I am very concerned with the taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| but the thing is, is ultimately that is going to be decided in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| There is litigation going on, and whether it was appropriate for Mr. Evans to not require natural resources to pay or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1490)|
| 0:25:02| will be determined by a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| And my primary concern, being the district commissioner, is the welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| and the quality of life of the citizens of the Solway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| And so my concern is I'm very focused on the odor issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| and I'm just wondering whether we're not getting lost in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| the financial issue that will ultimately not be decided by us but will be decided by the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| and whether we're not losing focus on the environmental and quality of life issues associated with the smell that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1533)|
| 0:25:41| you know, I think our primary focus should be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| And with this RFP that's being presented, I think that we could tweak that a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| and fix it to where that not only could no biosolids be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| but that for biosolids to be used in the future to where it has to come back to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| and there has to be some new technology that takes away the odor issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| Because I'll tell you right now, with current technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| this is way too close to residential neighborhoods to be using biosolids in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| It just creates too much of an odor issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| Commissioner Lambert, actually that is in the new RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| that essentially we will discontinue taking biosolids on July the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| And if we opt to go back with a composting or any type of operation similar to what was done in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| with the biosolids, it will be brought back to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| And I think it's worded just exactly what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Could there be some provision written in that to make it just a wee bit stronger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| where we basically say that biosolids cannot be considered at the Saw Way facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1610)|
| 0:26:58| unless a significant technology change takes place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| Now, I look at the Forks of the River location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| and it's far enough away from residences to where it may be a more appropriate place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| to use the foul-smelling materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| But I think that before we should ever even consider using biosolids in the Saw Way area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| as close proximity as we have neighbors there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| that that should only be done if there's a significant technology change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| I don't disagree with what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| I think the challenge is defining significant technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| What I can say is that any biosolid-type composting would take place up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| would have to come back before this commission for specific approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| And I guess as presented to this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| then you can make a determination through that process whether that is a significant technology change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| But what we have done is essentially we've eliminated biosolids through the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| And secondly, we have stated in there that if we intend to start up a composting program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| we will come back before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| One other thing I need to point out is that is a regulated activity, so it does require a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| So once we get the compost that we have up there now dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| we don't intend to renew that permit, so we would have to apply for another permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| So there are several safeguards in effect that would bring this back in the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| i.e., through this commission, to address exactly what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Well, first of all, Commissioner Lambert, I'm not downplaying the odor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| and the contamination of that out there, but right now I'm interested in the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| Bruce, what I was saying there is if we had something set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| then John Evans would not have been able to have done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Now, from four years from 2003 to 2007, if I got something that seemed they weren't paying us any money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1727)|
| 0:28:54| I would have questioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| And what I'm really concerned about, not just this right now, them not paying us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| how many more people out there are maybe not paying us that we don't know about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| I mean, we need control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| And I realize Mr. Troyer has just taken over the finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| but that's what I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| If we had had some kind of checks and balances in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| John Evans could not have done that without coming before county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| and explaining why we were not getting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| Yes, sir, and I don't disagree with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| What I'm really hitting at is I honestly believe John never gave coming back to commission a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1765)|
| 0:29:32| I don't think he thought in those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| I don't think he did this in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| He certainly was a very honest individual, and I want to make sure that's pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| He just did not think about the commission component involved in this, and you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| Had there been a checks and balance, somebody would have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| hey, this part of this contract is not being fulfilled, especially when we're talking about money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| If nothing else, a light bulb would have gone off in my head saying, well, hang on a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| We need to get this rectified through commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| and we certainly would have been dealing with this much sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| You know, that's the way I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| I'm not saying that I may have agreed with John if he had come up here and presented his case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| but we just need something to alert us on the amount of money we're taking in that's not being paid to us for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| That's all I'm suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| I guess, Bruce, how many complaints through, I guess, code, TDEC, have we had on this company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1824)|
| 0:30:32| I know there's a number out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| I just don't know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| I think it stems around essentially the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| David's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Can you answer that, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| And I have a follow-up to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| Hang on, I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| Has this company, do you know how many violations they have been issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| You need to get your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| David Draper, 620 Market Street, Council for National Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| I don't know the total number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| They use a form throughout the history of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| We get any of a number of four potential regulators that come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| They're all in the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| I don't know what the number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| It could be 20 or something over a five-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| And does Natural Resources operate a business similar to this outside of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1888)|
| 0:31:38| You asked me about that before outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| and I've expressed to you already that I'm not totally familiar with the nature of Natural Resources operations in Louisiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1900)|
| 0:31:50| That's where Mr. Bryan started his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| I told you before that there's a construction and demolition landfill down there that he operates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| and also a mulching facility down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| Well, why I'm getting to that is because we've had people, citizens of the 6th District, complaining about odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1921)|
| 0:32:08| So have they had odor problems and had violations issued to them in Louisiana for basically the same problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1928)|
| 0:32:19| I know that Mr. Mays has called one of the East Baton Rouge commissioners down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| and had lengthy discussions with him in which he has told that commissioner that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| we have all sorts of problems up here and was soliciting information about what the nature of our problems were down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1949)|
| 0:32:39| Mr. Bryan's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| You know, I've got to comment to you that we have reached out to each of the members of commission to talk about this openly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| and to work through tours of the facility to explain the operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| I think there's a lawsuit pending, and candidly, we're only willing to go so far with a pending lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1974)|
| 0:33:05| with the plaintiff sitting right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| We want to be forthright and answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| It seems to me that there is an agenda here to press beyond Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| If there was a history of my client in another state, it seems to me that would have come up back at the time of the original contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=1999)|
| 0:33:28| The fact is I don't think that history is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| I don't have a specific answer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| So they've had no problems in Louisiana?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| Mister, my understanding is that one of the facilities is in a minority district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2016)|
| 0:33:44| and there has been an effort to fend off a renewal of the licensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2024)|
| 0:33:52| I think my client has sought to expand the height of the landfilling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2032)|
| 0:34:00| and there's been an effort made to fight that by one of the commissioners down there and some of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2040)|
| 0:34:10| But I've got to tell you, the nature of the discussions have been that we had some fraudulent track record down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2050)|
| 0:34:24| with revenue share and odor, and it's a part of this hatchet job on natural resources, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2064)|
| 0:34:34| I don't know what specific information you have that causes you to ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| I know of nothing to suggest that we have some sort of a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| first of all, I don't know of anybody that operates a landfill that doesn't get complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| and so it wouldn't surprise me if there had been complaints in Louisiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| Well, let me stop you right there, and you talk about a hatchet job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| You know, when we've got a contract signed by the mayor of this county and by the president of the company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2096)|
| 0:35:05| we've got money that hasn't been turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| We've got bonds that nobody can find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| We have no notice of being released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| I think you're way out of line calling it a hatchet job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| Well, I'm not referring to the concern, the commission's concern about the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| I think that's a very valid inquiry, and I don't disagree with anything that Commissioner Pinkson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| I wasn't referring to something, you know, a hatchet job by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| It's quite frankly the way that Mr. Mays has gone about castigating my client by phone calls to suppliers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2130)|
| 0:35:39| and to commissioners in Baton Rouge and some of the communications with commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| to suggest that my client has done something fraudulent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| You've been told by Mr. Weitrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| I've been told by Mr. Weitrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| I've been told by Mr. Salter and Mr. Denton and Mr. Rockett and by Mr. Monofo and by Matt Myers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| that John Evans made a decision back in 2003 about revenue share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| The unfortunate thing is there's not a paper trail on his decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| but he's tape recorded by this man telling him why he made the decision, what his rationale was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| And the theory of the lawsuit is we've defrauded Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| Well, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| You're an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| But if you were my attorney and I was operating a company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| I don't know any attorney today in this country that would operate off something verbal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| Happens every day, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| Well, when you go to court, do you tell the judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| John down there said we didn't have to do this, but here's the signed contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| It says we have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| Now, which one of those things do you think the judge is going to listen to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| the signed statements and the signed contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| or that you made an out-of-the-room handshake that got you out of having to pay money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2212)|
| 0:37:02| Do Knox County, after Knox County has spent millions of dollars on that facility, of taxpayer dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2222)|
| 0:37:11| My client has spent millions of dollars trying to make a go of the operation at Solway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| on a fraction of the material that they were told they would receive in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| My client has invested in millions of dollars in equipment and labor over five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| trying to make a go of this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| There are a lot of issues involved with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| And it's my understanding now that there's a resolution before commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| to bar us from competing for the new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| No, you're talking about a resolution that talks about having litigation against Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| or Knox County against a company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| The city of Knoxville has one just like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| And I have people that try to bid, but they weren't able to bid on city contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| What if the allegations are untrue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| How could they be untrue when you're supposed to pay us money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| We don't have any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| You were supposed to keep a bond in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| The bond is missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| No one has any paper trail to say why it was released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| Do you know why it was released?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| Yeah, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| I'd like to hear why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| We requested that it be released because we were limping along financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| Who did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Who ordered it released?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Knox County Purchasing released the bond was what I was told before I came here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| and that was a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Who told you that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| I thought in meetings, and we've had a bunch of meetings over this for all sorts of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| that it was released by I had understood that it was a decision made by Matt Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| and it was kind of a no-brainer because my client had been performing under the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2329)|
| 0:38:56| Now, you know, Matt Myers, you need to ask him what his recollection of it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| He doesn't know who did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| I can tell you one person that didn't release it is National Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| We don't have the authority to release it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| Somebody on the county side of this equation released the bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| and I suspect they did because they knew that we were a performing contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| Bruce told you that the county's concern was that you didn't have some fly-by-night operation out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| So the bond was released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| But we don't know by who, and you don't know by who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| I don't know exactly who made the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| I wish I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| But there's an inference here, I think, that maybe Natural Resources had a hand in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| My client asked that it be released, and it was released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| And I don't know what their internal procedures are for the release of a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| Did he ask in writing it be released?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| In our contract itself, when you come down to the performance bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2394)|
| 0:40:02| it does not request that the release of it is in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| I did state that I am not sure who released the performance bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2407)|
| 0:40:15| and I do not believe the purchasing division released it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| But as far as in writing, there will be no documentation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| It does not require it by the contract itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| But you're aware the contract said that it couldn't be released until at least June 30th of 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2428)|
| 0:40:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| When we took a look at the performance bond at the time, it was past that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| So we did not question the performance bond being in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| because it did not need to be in place if someone released it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| So it was released after June 30th of 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| I am not sure of the date it was released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| but by the time that I took a look at it personally, it was well beyond 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| Yes, it's when you looked at it, but I think there was some say in 2002 in this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2466)|
| 0:41:13| that it was released a year later, in 03, maybe early of 04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| Commissioner, let me see if I can clarify some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| I don't know who released it, but if I were guessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| I would say it was on the recommendation of John Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| When I was contacted about this performance bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| that the bond was in fact either had expired or was no longer in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| I immediately picked up the phone and called purchasing to find out what the situation was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| because a performance bond is a serious matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| Now, they told me the contract provisions was that it could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| and I may be wrong about the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| I thought it was a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Maybe it is three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| I don't know when it was released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| but the purpose of the performance bond is to make sure, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| that I don't have an operation up there that we're going to get stuck with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| that we have a contractor who performs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| After they've shown they can perform, and for me, that would be a term of a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| Now, in the contract, it's three years or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| I certainly would have recommended it to be released also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Now, we have other contracts with the county that we keep a performance bond in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| until everything is done, like our road construction projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| They have to keep the bond done until we cut the ribbon on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| In a situation like this, we were looking at what kind of damage could be caused to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| if they decide, say, to heck with this, we're leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| We estimated zero damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| Well, they haven't paid us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| We might be able to use the bond for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| And here again, the money aspect of it is, is that I revisit this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| is that clearly from the outset of this, the contract needed to be modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| This composting facility is probably the first in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| We were dealing with a lot of things that we never dealt with before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| So there needed to be changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| It was kind of a growing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| And Commissioner Pinkston is absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| Had there been something in there that would have certainly alerted me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| then we would have had this in front of you sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| We would have been dealing with this three or four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| saying these are the changes we need to make to this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| because clearly we've made representations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| We didn't lie to them, but we made representations that panned out not to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| And there are certain other factors that have arisen that makes this profit share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| or revenue share really not feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| because the county is not going to be able to fulfill their contractual obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| so this contractor also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| So, quite frankly, Commissioner Pinkston is absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| Had there been something in there that set a light off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| we would have been dealing with this three or four years ago instead of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| But here we are today trying to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| Well, there's four or five things, Bruce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| that you keep hearing from the contractors that say this is why we didn't pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| One was all the material was gone when they got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| In the contract it says it belongs to the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| I guess the old contractor, the interim contractor, took whatever was his off the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2630)|
| 0:43:58| They signed a contract, I'm sure with the same language in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| that when they leave they'll take whatever they've got ground up into mulch and take it with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| Secondly, they talked about that there wasn't any expansion made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| It's clear out there that the expansion has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| I'm not certain about that second part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| And here again, we're looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| There's certainly two ways that you can look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| I don't disagree with anything you're saying when you look at this purely in a legal sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| I don't think John certainly, and I oftentimes don't look at things like that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| I'm going to try to do the fair thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| And that's not to violate a contract or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| but I want to be fair to our contractors as I want them to be fair to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| And so there's representations made in the RFP or assumptions that were made that clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| if I've got employees out there, unless they were just completely out in the left field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| making representations to contractors and so forth, we're going to honor those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| provided they're not making illegal representations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| So they were led to believe that there was going to be some product on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| That's certainly not in writing anywhere, but I'm sure based on site visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| Well, they plucked the site clean within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| Nobody foresaw that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| Clearly the representations that we made in the RFP about the green waste falling short, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| That is not, if you go to court, I don't think that's something that they can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| well, you're liable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| You said there's going to be two or three times that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| Going to court, that's going to get, I'm not an attorney, but that's going to get tossed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| But I think it's important that the county made that representation in good faith, and it didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| They likewise built a business plan around representations we made both in the RFP and in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| And when you add all those up, that's why this revenue share just wasn't practical any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| And again, that's something that should have been brought back before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| and I don't think you all would have had a problem with it, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| had it been brought back three or four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| But certainly now it makes it look like there's been something funny going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| There hasn't been anything funny going on, I can assure you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| It's just that John should have brought it back to you sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| Well, you know, maybe there's nothing funny at all going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| but it certainly appears that we've got a contract that certainly has been violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| And actually by both parties, by both the Knox County and Natural Resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| both parties have not fulfilled their obligations in regards to this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| And the people out there have suffered with odor control problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2780)|
| 0:46:28| There's a man out there that says his well had leaves or something in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| And John Evans in a letter told someone, I don't know if it's the state or to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| that there wasn't any wells or active wells within a mile of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| Now, the citizens out there I think have had enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| And we've worked on this odor control for two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| And I think they've been cited numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| They've had numerous complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| But as far as actually being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| Well, let's get to one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Talk about spraying that pond water onto the mulch piles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| They were told by the state not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| The next time the state was out there, they found them doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| Rolled them up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| They told them not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| They said they wouldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| The state was out there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| Still spraying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| So how many times do we have to tell somebody not to be doing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| I don't have any knowledge of any particular specifics of any violations that I could answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2849)|
| 0:47:37| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| And, again, my concerns are focused most strongly on the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| I realize that I'm concerned about the taxpayers' money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| but I know that eventually a judge is going to make a decision in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| and that if Knox County is owed some money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| that we're going to get that money through the judicial process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| But talking back about the odor, Mr. Mays, you live closest to it, Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| And I want to say Lynn has got a problem out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| Lynn calls me and tells me when there's an odor issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| And if I'm available, if I'm close by, I run out there and check it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| And there certainly is an odor issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| Sometimes by the time I get there, it's not quite as bad as it was when he called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| But, I mean, there's a serious odor problem in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| And what I'm wondering is when did that odor problem begin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| Did it begin in 2001 when they started grinding and mulching out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| or did it begin in July of 2003 when they actually started using the biosolids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2924)|
| 0:48:51| What I'm concerned with is, is mulching itself a problem that close to neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| or is it the biosolids that created the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| And I think this is important because no matter who gets the contract through this re-bidding process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| whether it's Natural Resources or somebody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| these neighbors do not need to have to pay the price and smell that odor for the rest of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| They need some relief from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| And is it the mulching process period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| Did it begin in 2001 or did it begin in 2003 when they started using biosolids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| My name is Len Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| I live at 10,017 West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| I'm not sure when they started and what they brought in up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| But in February of 2005, we found out where the odor was coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| We probably had an odor about three to five months prior to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| before we discovered where the odor was coming from and the cause of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| And in February of 2005 is when we started trying to eliminate this odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| Mr. Weitrich here was just talking about representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| When this county put in the request for the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| they said in that permit to the state of Tennessee that the odor can and will be controlled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3007)|
| 0:50:14| They told the people of Knox County, or us, the residents in there, that they would control this odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| Yet they did not control the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| We still got a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| They misrepresented us, the people, not the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| Why is it that they don't do something for us instead of doing something for the company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| Well, that's what we're attempting to do here with this new RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| And on that RFP, I'd like to make a suggestion that if you're going for a compost facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| not be allowed at the saw wave facility because of the residents' close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| And if it does, by all solids, is allowed someplace, I think it's the Forks River or the other place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| Yeah, I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| And, like I said, that's my main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Because, like I said, this financial stuff that we're talking about, and I am concerned for the taxpayers' money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| but ultimately that will not be decided by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| Ultimately that will be decided by a judge when this is litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| What my primary concern is is that we set this contract up to where biosolids cannot be used in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3079)|
| 0:51:29| Because I'll tell you, I've looked on the Internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| and natural resources is not the only person who's had a problem with composting and biosolids close to residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3092)|
| 0:51:40| It just does not seem to be a good activity to have close to where folks are living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3100)|
| 0:51:48| And I'm concerned that we make sure that no matter who goes into this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| that they will not be using biosolids that close to the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Yes, this is for the law director there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| I've sat here, and we've had three problems, the money, the performance bond, and the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3126)|
| 0:52:15| Two of these are directly Knox County's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3135)|
| 0:52:22| The money, we should have been knowing about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| This performance bond, I'm going to suggest for the law department to draw up a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3145)|
| 0:52:33| that any time that a performance bond is released, it has to be in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| and it needs to come before this commission with the reasoning as to vote up or down on the release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3159)|
| 0:52:46| We've got to get some control of our government's finances here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| We're going into a lean year, and yet we're not doing our job in controlling our dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| I can't blame the people out there on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| I really can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| Commissioner Pinkston, if I could comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| We literally deal with, I probably have a couple hundred drainage and road bonds currently that developers have to submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3186)|
| 0:53:15| You might want to look into bonds as they relate to contracts that Knox County has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3195)|
| 0:53:23| Essentially, when I have a performance bond on a subdivision, we go out and do an inspection on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| If the drainage has been installed, the road's installed, for instance, those roads that you all just accepted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| we release that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| I just want to mention that because in many cases people are putting up their own money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| and a 30 or 45 delay to them is significant because we deal with literally lots of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| You may want to have it to apply to the contracts the county enters into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| That's a whole different matter, and certainly I'd be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| I'll go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| You own that, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| I realize we can't stop our government just completely and vote on everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| but these things like we're talking about right now, that's serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| Commissioners, if I could make a point to clarify something that's been mentioned several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| that the nonpayment of revenue shares is a subject of litigation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| And that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| It is a subject of litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| But just to clarify, the issue involved in that litigation is only whether the county has been defrauded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3251)|
| 0:54:18| or whether there's been a violation of the False Claims Act with regard to nonpayment of revenue shares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3258)|
| 0:54:26| What is not necessarily at issue in litigation yet is whether the performance of both parties has conformed to the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3266)|
| 0:54:36| and if not, what should be done about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| This commission can consider and take action with regard to past departures from the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3280)|
| 0:54:54| and what should be done in the future going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| So I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| I understand what you're talking about, but that wouldn't bother either one of these resolutions I'm asking you to put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| And I've made note of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| We've got to get some control over our government up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Apparently we've grown so fast that we don't have these checks and balances in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| I went out last week and I visited the facility, and it just so happened while I was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3320)|
| 0:55:28| there was two loads of bio-waste that was brought in while I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| I mean, they had just come off the truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| And, you know, I am in construction and I have, when we start digging in the dirt, there's a smell that's released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3335)|
| 0:55:48| You know, I mean, it's not anything different than you have on a normal farm in a farming community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3348)|
| 0:55:57| I guess my concern comes from the fact that I really don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| When I was out there, I spent probably an hour and a half out there that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| and there was nothing that I smelled that particular day that, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| was any different than any other agricultural farming community or any area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3373)|
| 0:56:20| When you make mulch, I mean, I know when people come in, they put it around my shrubbery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| I mean, it smells like the country for weeks, you know, until it settles down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3387)|
| 0:56:37| And as far as bio-waste, you know, the attorney for natural resources was out there that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3397)|
| 0:56:44| and, you know, he picked up a handful of it, which, you know, I give him credit for picking it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| I wouldn't personally pick it up, but he picked it up, and I smelled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| And, again, there was two fresh loads that were just dumped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| and there was no different smell than what I smell in regular topsoil whenever it's been turned over at a construction site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3416)|
| 0:57:04| I'm not saying, Mr. Mays, that you don't have some on certain conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3424)|
| 0:57:12| but I guess I'm wanting to try to understand when you notice this smell that's different than it was when I was out there that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3432)|
| 0:57:21| because it had rained the day before, the sun was out, the wind was blowing towards your house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3441)|
| 0:57:29| and I didn't, I mean, I didn't smell anything any different than I do at one of my construction sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| I took a tour of West Lox Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| Their sewers, after they treat that stuff, it's just like soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| It has no smell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| It's just a little musty, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| And that's the way it was the day that I was out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| But you let it sit out in the sun two or three days, then you get the smell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| And I can't remember the gentleman that ran this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| He told me through it and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| I said, well, how come I have such a horrible smell up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| He said, well, once it's exposed to the sun and starts heating up, that's when you get the smell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| He said, some of the facilities keep this stuff on hand three or four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| It starts smelling, then it will take it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| And if you have one load come in that's been sitting out in the sun like that and you're up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| you got the smell right then and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| You don't have to wait three or four days for it to start smelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| It's sort of a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| It was about the resolution that we passed earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| I guess it goes on now to the general commission meeting about barring the county from doing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3519)|
| 0:58:46| with any companies that either the county is suing or they're suing the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| Do we have a law like that in place now or is this a new one that we're proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3531)|
| 0:59:01| I may want to let Mr. Munafoe address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| but it's my understanding that right now as part of the procurement code and purchasing regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| we do have a process in place to debar potential vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| That is done through the finance department, I believe, or it may be the purchasing division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3553)|
| 0:59:20| We don't have anything that I'm aware of that specifically prohibits a potential bidder from bidding on a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| if they're in litigation with or against the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| The reason I'm asking this is that if the RFP is already out and they've made a bid for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3570)|
| 0:59:37| and then this ordinance or resolution passes at the next commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| does this fall under the ex post facto provision where we can't retroactively apply this to a company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| that already has a bid out on a project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| To be honest with you, Commissioner, I'm not sure what the answer to that question is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| That's something that I would have to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| It's my understanding that the RFP was just issued last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| Bids, I don't believe, have been submitted yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| But we would have to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| That's certainly a valid question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| I think you want to say something first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| Yes, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| We do have a debarment clause in our, I want to say, through regulations or code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| It's real important to know which one of those, but I do not have it on hand with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| Typically it's because a vendor or contractor has been convicted of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| There's nothing about litigation in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| I will say, and I spoke to Mr. Owings earlier, depending how this resolution is worded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3642)|
| 1:00:49| it may have to go through two readings before it goes into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| depending on if it's in the regulations or code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| Commissioner, I actually have a copy, I believe, of the purchasing department manual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3661)|
| 1:01:09| the section that deals with debarment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| I don't know if you want me to read part of that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3671)|
| 1:01:22| I guess I'm not so interested in that as I am about this new resolution that's coming forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| and how that would impact someone putting a bid in if they've already got a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| If the bids aren't out and if it takes one or two readings, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| we're talking about a month or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| so probably the bids would be out by the time that it would have the effect of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3697)|
| 1:01:44| And my question was, does this fall under an ex post facto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| It's where something's passed after, you know, the person already has a bid in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| And that's something we'll have to take a look at and we'll answer as quickly as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| You finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| What I want to do is ask the law director to, for Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| and I don't know if it would pass commission but I'm going to try to put it on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| to terminate the contract for cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| And the cause is under section 211 of their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| It says that the contractor has not made revenue sharing payments as per this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3736)|
| 1:02:24| I'll make note of that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| I will point out that the contract also requires a 15-day notice of default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| Notice before it can be terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| So that's certainly something we would have to comply with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| Yeah, I just wanted to, Mr. Daniels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| I have been out to that site on numerous occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| I'm not sure what the atmospheric conditions are that create it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| Because I have been out there, Mr. Mays will call me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| and actually if Sharon Kaywood was here, simply because she lived closer to the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3779)|
| 1:03:06| went down there numerous times before I started going down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| But Mr. Mays will call and, of course, I'll run down to check out the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| Because in the beginning, and I'll confess, Mr. Mays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| I wondered whether he was smelling mulch and just didn't like the smell of mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| But after a couple of visits down there, this is not a mulchy smell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| This is a septic tank, a very sewer type smell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3809)|
| 1:03:36| And it doesn't exist all the time, but under certain atmospheric conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| it makes a stink bomb for that entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| And like I said, we have been trying to speculate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| Of course, when you've got a foul odor like that, rumors run rampant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| And, of course, checking to see if someone was breaking into the site and dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3834)|
| 1:04:00| I know there was a rumor that the porta potty people were dumping illegally there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| that they were breaking in and dumping stuff after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| And so when there was a smell, I would run down there to check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| Could never identify a reason for it, but there are times when the odor is foul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| And what I've found through studying on the Internet is that that is a problem with biosolids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| And almost everywhere that it's been composted close to where human beings are living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3866)|
| 1:04:33| Bruce, is it my understanding that this new RFP that's getting ready to be released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3873)|
| 1:04:41| will contain provisions to where there will not be biosolids used at that particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Yes, sir, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| So, Mr. Mays and Mr. Mays, if that's not used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3889)|
| 1:04:56| do you believe that's going to take care of the issue of the smell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3896)|
| 1:05:04| Go ahead, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| That's something that we tried to get the mayor to do back in 2005| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| when he said it wouldn't go through December of 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| We said we'll stop bringing in the biosolids to see if that corrects the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| Well, three years later we're finally to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| and we're going to stop bringing in the biosolids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| Hopefully it will control the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| But if it does not control our odor problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| is there anything in that RFP that's going to help us keep that odor down or eliminate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3933)|
| 1:05:41| Personally, I don't think if you're going to grind green waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| you're going to grind trees, pallets, and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| You're always going to have a smell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| Now, whether or not that's as Mr. Lambert...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| It won't be the smell that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| And I want to say this and I want to ask natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| How long is it going to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| I mean, there is already material on site that contain biosolids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| How long is it going to take to get rid of what biosolids are already in the mix out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3965)|
| 1:06:13| Well, is that something that will be done quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| I mean, I would think it would take several months, possibly even a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| And one of my concerns with that after a year they can request to use biosolids again is that are we going to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3981)|
| 1:06:31| you know, by the time the biosolids are used up that exist on the property now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| are they going to be coming back asking to use biosolids again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| Let me answer your second question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| In order for them to come back and do any kind of biosolids operation, anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| regardless of who the contractor is, it's got to come back before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| That's in the RFP clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| That's got to come back for this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| Personally, I don't intend to start a biosolids operation either there or forks of the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| unless it gets brought back to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| Of course, I may be gone, but I can tell you I don't want to have to deal with a biosolids issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| without it coming before the commission and making sure we put in the necessary safeguards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| We do have some experience in dealing with composting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| I think one of the shortcomings we had out there quite clearly is we got some stuff from First Utility District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4039)|
| 1:07:26| that was ripe, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| It was not properly processed when it was brought up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| It was not properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| It shouldn't have been up there in the first place due to the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| And I think that's what kicked all this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| That material hasn't been there for quite a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| And I think Mr. Mays has made this statement before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| The problem with the odor has gotten progressively better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| It's certainly not been eradicated, but it has gotten progressively better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| And we've tried to do just about everything that we know to do to do something about the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4074)|
| 1:08:00| I think certain assumptions were made that didn't hold up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| Inversion, for instance, that the air would rise up and essentially go across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| or get high enough that it wouldn't affect property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| Those types of things didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| So that's why in the new RFP is we've elected not to go down to biosolids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| And here again, if we want to revisit that, it's got to come back to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| I don't know what other legitimate safeguard I can put in beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| Commissioner Ivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| I just want to make sure there's not a handshake involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| I mean, that's why we got into some trouble before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| So let's make sure there ain't no handshaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| This permit of the composting issued to the county, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| it's automatically renewed until the county requests a permit be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4123)|
| 1:08:51| I think that's what I read in my 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| What I can tell you this much is that we want to get out of a regulated process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| meaning that I want to get the composting done out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| I didn't answer your first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| Your first question, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| I can't put an ultimate date out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| but certainly we're going to quit taking biosolids on July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| I would think that the compost would need to be out there for at least six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| for proper processing before it leaves the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| But after that, I want to get out from underdoing biosolids out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| the permit requirements, the inspections that are involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| and the things the county has to do to be in compliance with that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| Why are we going to stop taking them July 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| Why don't we stop taking them March 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| I think, in fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| it gives them an opportunity to deal with whatever contracts they may have with other suppliers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| And it starts anew with a new RFP that specifically exempts biosolids from that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4182)|
| 1:09:51| Mike Cohen, would your clients be willing to voluntarily cut off biosolids immediately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4191)|
| 1:10:05| I don't know that I can give you a clear name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| Mike Cohen, 1111 North Shore Suite N400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| I don't know that I can give you a clear answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| I guess there are people that think I don't give clear answers for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| And you're awfully good at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| We have contracts in place with utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| We're in a situation where the contract is being put back out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| There is potentially a resolution before commission to say we can't bid on the new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| I think for us to stand before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| and make any commitment to do one thing or another right now would be not wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4237)|
| 1:10:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Well, I would certainly like to see that stop immediately rather than wait until July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| I just anticipate I'm the one that answers those complaints now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| and those are my citizens out there that are smelling that odor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| and I can anticipate a pretty bad summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4258)|
| 1:11:05| I mean, there's some older folks out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| They don't have many summers left to enjoy their yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| There's some younger folks that those summers are lifetime memories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| that are going to be created or not created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| and so I'm really concerned with the citizens of the Solway area not to be robbed of another summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4278)|
| 1:11:26| because they can't go outside because of the smell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| You know, the other thing I'd point out, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| and I'm not arguing with you, those are all valid points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| My client, Natural Resources Recovery, did not pick the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| Of course, it took over operations of it from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| and there was a belief when Knox County picked the site that the odors would rise, and they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| So I just want to make it clear when we deal with the odor issue that we simply operated at a site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| that we were assigned to by Knox County, not a site that we picked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| When we hired an odor consultant, and I think you've all been supplied copies of that report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| the report actually said the odor problems for a facility doing what we were doing were actually fairly minimal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| but we were doing a good job of managing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| So understand that it is an industry, as you have pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| that anywhere it's operated near homes there have potentially been some issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| but that should not be taken to imply that Natural Resources Recovery has not done a good job of managing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4342)|
| 1:12:31| Also, one other thing I wanted to mention in terms of any violations that were issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| the violations actually wouldn't have been issued to Natural Resources Recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| as we are not the permit holder from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| It's the first facility of the kind in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| so the state has really been learning its way through this process as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| but the permit is held by Knox County, not by Natural Resources Recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| Mr. Cooper, could I ask that Neil Denton speak to you all for just a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| There's not a person in this room that knows more about the history of this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| and the nature of the operations than Neil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| Neil Denton, extension agent here in Knox County, 160 Covenant Circle, Lenore City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4387)|
| 1:13:16| Do you have any questions for me about the site or about the science of the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4396)|
| 1:13:27| Neil, I'm going to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| If I go down to Walmart and buy a 50-pound bag of Hypenex yard mulch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4409)|
| 1:13:37| what would I find on the ingredients of that product?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| I guess what I'm getting at, am I going to see biosolids on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| You can see biosolids on some of the products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| Milorganite is one of the products that's been used for a number of years in horticulture and agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4432)|
| 1:13:58| which is biosolids that are treated in a similar fashion from Milwaukee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| And it's been used as a common fertilizer around all over the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4444)|
| 1:14:11| And it's treated and made in a similar fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4451)|
| 1:14:17| Yeah, but probably not made right next to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| I don't know where it's actually made at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| One of the things that this product has been very, very well received by our landscaping community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4464)|
| 1:14:32| as a product that is needed in our soils and for plant growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| And they make a very good product, a product that has been very useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| And it's something that we need, I think, in the agriculture and the horticulture of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4480)|
| 1:14:47| And natural resources have provided something that is not really available to those industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4487)|
| 1:14:55| And it's been a real boost to some of these industries for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| Mr. Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| I guess my question to Neal is, Neal, you were raised on a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| And I know occasionally when the barnyard gets full of manure, you have to haul it out in the field and spread it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4505)|
| 1:15:12| That puts out an odor, doesn't it, for a certain amount of time, maybe until after it rains or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| What's your personal opinion of this operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| Is that asking a big question whether you can pros or cons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| Well, my personal opinion is they've done a lot to try to control the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| And, yes, there is odor with any organic material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| And one of the things that happens with the odor that the people are smelling is air inversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4533)|
| 1:15:40| And also the atmosphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| When the air above is too heavy, the odor is sent down the slope or held close to the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| And you do get more of an odor than you would expect if it's just a normal day where the odor rises very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4548)|
| 1:15:57| They've done a good job trying to make a good product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| And they make good product that's being used out in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| And odor is something you can't get away from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| I tell people odor is in the nose of the beholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| I mean, I grew up on a farm and our hog lot was 20 feet above our well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| So, you know, there is definitely something you get used to odors and you don't really smell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4576)|
| 1:16:23| But the smells that I have encountered out there have been more of a natural smell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| what you would smell in the soil or in organic wood waste decomposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4588)|
| 1:16:35| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| I haven't finished yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| Oh, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| I just want to agree with what Neal said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| I was out there last week and also I did not notice the smell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| The operation, I think we need an operation like that, whether it's in this community or where we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| It's got to be done somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| I guess my biggest question is how much of this mulch, and Neal, it's probably not your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| it would be somebody from Brewster, has been donated to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| Do they donate mulch, Bruce, to Parks and Recreation, Knoxville Green, Keep Knoxville Beautiful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4618)|
| 1:17:08| Could this be part of their profit they're losing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| I do know that they donate product to various causes, various organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| I don't have that volume that they donate, but I do know they do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| So I know they've probably given a lot of their profits away that should have come back as cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| But I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| Neal, thank you for your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| Neal, I know you deal a lot with the University of Tennessee, Knox County and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4655)|
| 1:17:39| The city of Knoxville has a recycling facility similar to what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4659)|
| 1:17:47| Their site, I haven't been on it in a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| but their site is primarily just grinding up woody waste to make a mulch product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| Like Natural Resources, they take stuff from, I guess, Hosdell Powell and First Utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| They don't take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| Not from First Utility, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| Hosdell Powell and some other places in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| I'm not aware if you're saying they're running a composting operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| No, Natural Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| Oh, I thought you were talking about the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| No, the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| KUB, where do they take their?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| KUB has their stuff processed and sent out to large farms and large land tracks, and it's spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4702)|
| 1:18:31| They don't do the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| They do an anaerobic digestion of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| and it's moved off site and stored on the farm for a few days and then spread immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| So it's kind of like it's spread and used on the farm for, I guess, nutrients of the soil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| Yeah, it's an organic fertilizer they use to put out on pastures and also row crop fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4728)|
| 1:18:57| So would you think that's something that we ought to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| if we quit taking it out there at Natural Resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| that these other companies will have a place to take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| They can take it to send it to the farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| Some of them will have a place to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| That's a very expensive operation to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| and the volumes that you have to have to do that are pretty high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| And it's getting harder and harder to find large tracks of farmland with the cost of transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4759)|
| 1:19:25| that makes it real feasible to take it out to farmland and spread it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4765)|
| 1:19:33| Is it a process of what they're going to put on the farm and what to bring out here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4773)|
| 1:19:41| What they're going to put on the farm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| Mr. Mays, could you speak into the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| I was wondering what the difference in the processes were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| You said what they're going to put on the farm and what they're taking to the Natural Resources Recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| There's many different processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| From what I understand here at KEB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| they do an anaerobic digestion where they digest it in water pools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4799)|
| 1:20:06| and then the waste is taken through something called a press where they remove the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4806)|
| 1:20:12| And then it is taken to the farm, I think, is still what they call a Class B product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| which has restrictions on it as to where it can be spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| And they spread it then on large tracks of land, protecting waterways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| So that's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| The Class B is what they take in a Natural Resources Recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| West Knox Utility, that's the same process you just described, West Knox Utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4832)|
| 1:20:38| Well, and they do take a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| but then it is gone through the composting process to take it up the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| So it can be deregulated and used at any site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| If I might ask you a question, isn't a lot of sludge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4851)|
| 1:20:57| there's a large company that subcontracts disposing of sludge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| Let me give my name and address first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| I can't believe I forgot that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| My name is Bradley Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| And according to what I've discovered, there are a lot of people, companies such as Cinegro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4869)|
| 1:21:14| who specialize in disposing of sludge, who not only transport it in boxcars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| but they have large farms that they spread it on out in the southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| And that also this sludge can be limed and treated to Class B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| and is used by sod farmers on a regular basis because when they slice the sod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| they remove some of the topsoil and they do that to replenish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| And that also some landfills use it as a cover for growing grass on the landfill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| after the trash has been covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| Wouldn't that also be an acceptable use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| Because when I'm looking at the volumes that this place processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| according to the tons and stats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| we're only going through about 10,411 tons a year at that facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| which is about 28.5 tons a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4921)|
| 1:22:10| Now, those of you all who are familiar with construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| a gravel truck holds 22.5 tons a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| and it doesn't cover much space if you ever spread topsoil or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| So this facility is getting rid of a little more than one dump truck load a day of sludge for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| Sludge is a dense product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| We're probably looking at about one in a fifth of dump truck loads per day is the amount of sludge we're talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4948)|
| 1:22:36| just to put it in perspective for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| You get the average sod farmer, they haul a lot more than that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4959)|
| 1:22:46| The product has gone through several different types of stabilization, they call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| either through lime stabilization, which does the same thing composting does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4971)|
| 1:22:57| except it's a chemical reaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| The heat heats it up and takes out all the pathogens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| or the things that we might be concerned with when they're using lime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| Then it is applied not as you would apply compost necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| It is spread more like a fertilizer, spread at a low tonnage per acre as a source of plant nutrients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=4992)|
| 1:23:20| and also organic material in the soil at other sites is what's used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| The material that's made at Solway is taken a step further to become a Class A product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| that then can be used in homeowner situations and on lawns and on farms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| without restriction of any type when it's applied to the soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5019)|
| 1:23:47| You finished, Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5027)|
| 1:23:53| You did it on purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| Yes, it's better than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| I just wanted to say as far as the argument over whether this is a woodsy mulch smell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5038)|
| 1:24:06| or whether it's truly a foul odor, I would challenge you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| anyone who questions whether this is a foul odor or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| if you'll give Mr. Mays your telephone number where he can reach you at any hour of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| There are odors that exist there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| It's like a time bomb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| You have to be there when it goes off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| and I'm sure that Mr. Mays would be happy to alert you as to when it's going off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| There is a serious odor problem in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| and you may have to go to the site several times before you'll smell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| or you can take my word for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| Okay, one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| Neil, do you believe the product out there with the bio solids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5088)|
| 1:24:55| if it comes out of there and it's being put in front of subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| and kids are playing in it, catching the buzz and sitting in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| is it safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| Yes, I believe it's safe as long as it's applied in the soil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| and used as a mulch covering and gone through what they call the PFRP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| It's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| Are they doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| Neil, if I might ask you a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| if this mulch had a fecal coliform count hypothetically of 260,000 MPN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5120)|
| 1:25:27| would that be safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| Sorry, I couldn't tell who was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| That's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| I've got some problems that I can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| Me and you both today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| If it had a fecal coliform count hypothetically of 260,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| would that be considered safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| I do not know the regs by heart at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| The regs are for Class A, 1,000 MPN or below, Class B, 1 million or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5145)|
| 1:25:51| Would that be considered safe at 260,000 unregulated in the entrance of a subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5151)|
| 1:25:57| If that's the regs, no, it would not be considered safe at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| If they were wrote a violation for spraying water out of a retention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5163)|
| 1:26:11| that captured the leachate from this composting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| and those ponds had fecal coliform counts higher than 6,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| they didn't say how high, but just in excess of 6,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| and they sprayed it on a finished product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| and hypothetically this finished product had been sold to someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| could that jeopardize the safeness of that material?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| I wouldn't think there would be much chance of that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| And the reason is, is the product is still so biologically active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| and going through such a high heating process, chances are very slim that it could be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5199)|
| 1:26:45| If I were to tell you that I hired a private detective to purchase mulch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5205)|
| 1:26:51| posing as a retail customer, and he went to that facility and purchased mulch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5211)|
| 1:26:57| it was loaded in his truck, he drove straight to a laboratory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| the mulch never left his possession and it never left his site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| He took a sample of that mulch into the laboratory and they tested it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| and it had a fecal coliform count of 260,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| Would that surprise you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| Yeah, that would definitely surprise me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| Would it surprise you if it happened on multiple occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| with counts ranging from 4,500 to 260,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| Well, it would surprise me to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| One of the things to remember about fecal coliform is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| fecal coliform is in all biologic creatures, warm-blooded creatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| and material that's set out can be easily contaminated after the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| I mean, it's in everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| It's in our soil, it's in our landscapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| Everywhere we go, we are contacted with the material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| So before I could really answer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| I would have to know the very specifics of how that was handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| So hypothetically, if some of this pond water with a fecal coliform count that was high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5276)|
| 1:28:05| was sprayed on a finished product, like I see has happened in some of these reports with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5285)|
| 1:28:12| would that reintroduce the bacteria back to the food source?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5292)|
| 1:28:18| Back to the food source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| In other words, would you be reintroducing the fecal coliform back to the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| You could reintroduce them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| We never sprayed finished product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| We used the water which was allowed by TDEC for a long time, and they have changed about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| But the water that ran off of the product was taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| and to aid the process, sprayed back on product that was being treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| and processed under the process as defined by TDEC and EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| But to say that we sprayed that on our finished product is just wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| If this county commission would like to look in their books under tab number nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5334)|
| 1:29:01| which is labeled as the TDEC reports for this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| if you will turn back through those pages to an inspection dated May 25, 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5347)|
| 1:29:17| I'll give you all a few minutes to find that May 25, 2006 inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| At the bottom, you will read under comments, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| they are composting raw wood mulch by adding sewage runoff water from the pond to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| then selling it, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5376)|
| 1:29:42| That is a direct quote from the TDEC inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| I didn't write this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| TDEC wrote this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| They wrote they are composting raw wood mulch by adding sewage runoff water from the pond to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5388)|
| 1:29:56| and selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| In this book here in a little while, we're going to cover some of the lab results of those ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5399)|
| 1:30:05| It won't cover some of the lab results of the mulch that I've had purchased at that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| And by the way, you were told earlier by a gentleman that he thought they may have 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5411)|
| 1:30:17| maybe possibly 20 TDEC violations over the past five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| If you look at this file in 2006 alone, they had 20 violations, just in 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5421)|
| 1:30:30| I just wanted to clear that up for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| By the way, while I've got everybody's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| I've got something I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| No more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| You had a question, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| No, these numbers that are being mentioned here today, parts per million, spores per million, whatever they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5447)|
| 1:30:57| they just don't mean anything to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| I don't have the thresholds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| I don't know if that's excessive, if it's below tolerance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| I understand that and I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| You know, and I'm not somebody that fell off a watermelon truck on the way into town last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| I've studied just about every discipline that has ology at the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5474)|
| 1:31:19| And these still don't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| You know, you might as well be talking to a first grader up here as far as I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| So, you know, I need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| If I might interject just momentarily, respectfully, if I might submit to you this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5490)|
| 1:31:37| If I may submit to you this, if it was completely okay, how come TDEC wrote them up for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5497)|
| 1:31:44| If there was no problem with it, how come they were getting wrote violations for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5504)|
| 1:31:59| I don't know if Mr. Mays is intending to try his case here today or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| That's not why we came here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| We understood that there was a workshop that was going to be focused on a principle issue of revenue share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5527)|
| 1:32:15| You know, if you're going to get into TDEC reports and represent what's in TDEC reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| you ought to have TDEC here and you ought to be listening to TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| If commission wants to delve into all of the dynamics of our five-year history at Solway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5543)|
| 1:32:32| Mr. Mays is a competitor of natural resources and he has a financial incentive to pursue all of this with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5552)|
| 1:32:41| because if the county recovers something from natural resources, he gets a percentage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| So if the agenda here is to present his three-ring notebook of all of his evidence that he says he's built against us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5566)|
| 1:32:54| then we probably need to just go and prepare ourselves for what is his deposition, which is scheduled tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5574)|
| 1:33:03| That's not why we came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| We came here to convey to commission that a revenue share decision had been made back in 2003 by John Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5586)|
| 1:33:14| It's on a tape, if you care to listen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| He's got hours upon hours of phone calls, including some of me, none of which were divulged when he was taping people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5597)|
| 1:33:26| And so I would encourage the commission to recognize where we are and why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5606)|
| 1:33:35| And we've been forthright in trying to respond to inquiries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5615)|
| 1:33:40| We came here in good faith to deal with the issue of revenue share,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| which was a principal concern and rightly so by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| But I rather suspect that this will go on for hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| And, Commissioner Lambert, you've already observed that there's pending litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| There is pending litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| And I assure you all of these matters are going to be delved into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| Mr. Draper, it is true that we were here for revenue sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| but if any commissioner has anything on their mind that they want to ask dealing with the facility, it's allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5647)|
| 1:34:16| That's the reason we've deviated from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| I understand that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| I simply wanted to observe that it was not our intent to come here today to address everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| which Mr. Mays might desire to present to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| This is not the forum in which to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| Commission has every right to inquire and to be informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| But we're not going to try our lawsuit here in this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| I just want to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| Definitely noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| Commissioner Davis, we do need to wrap this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| A lot of us have been here since 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| We've got another meeting after this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| You have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| Insolvency board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| I just wanted to say that, basically, why are we here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| I mean, the RFP resolves probably the odor issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| We've got a telephone call that Mr. Evans clearly states ownership of making the decision about revenue sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5714)|
| 1:35:22| and that probably will have to be decided in a court, if so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5722)|
| 1:35:28| The contract is going to be renewed here in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| It seems to me like we're just talking about the same old things over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| and I don't see us making any progress forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| I went to the facility yesterday, toured the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| I'm impressed with their operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| I don't think that there's anything nefarious or malicious going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| I think that they had honest representation from Mr. Evans that he was acting as an agent of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5750)|
| 1:35:58| and they took his word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| I don't think that they felt like or even were aware of the process of how that works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5761)|
| 1:36:07| that they needed to come to commission to have any sort of contractual negotiations or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5767)|
| 1:36:13| and I feel like this is, we need to wrap this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5773)|
| 1:36:20| Commissioner, if I might answer Commissioner Davis, because it was essentially our, we did request the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| and it was to do exactly what Mr. Draper said was to address, that was the intent of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| was to address the issue of the revenue share, and we requested the workshop for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| If I may just speak for one second, I can stick to revenue sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| and if you give me ten minutes, I'm going to roll through my revenue sharing really quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| and keep it short and sweet for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| You all have a booklet in front of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| I haven't commissioned them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| Well, you know, talk about wrapping it up and what we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| what we have the authority to do is we can terminate this contract with cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5814)|
| 1:37:00| And if someone, you know, we had 12 elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| or we had eight county commissioners get thrown off the commission because somebody said we talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| This is taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| This is money that 140,000, 200,000 could be three or four more teachers in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5831)|
| 1:37:17| It could be three or four more policemen on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| We spent millions of dollars getting this facility ready, and we've not collected anything back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5840)|
| 1:37:27| Now, no one has the right to just say on a handshake deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5847)|
| 1:37:32| and if I'm running a million-dollar company, I don't think I do a handshake deal when I'm dealing with a company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5852)|
| 1:37:38| And I understand your point, but the point is that we're putting them through an incredible amount of litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5858)|
| 1:37:46| and an incredible amount of cost over something that they weren't really aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5866)|
| 1:37:52| and we're faulting them for something that really Mr. Evans needs to take ownership for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5872)|
| 1:37:57| and he can't do that because he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| Well, Commissioner Davis, they knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| It's in this contract right here that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| I understand that it's written in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| So they had to understand it or they wouldn't have signed the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| But that was in one point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| Mr. Evans later on said, don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| He's the one that did not make sure that the collection took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| Now, I agree with Mr. Pinks, and we need to make sure that that doesn't happen again in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| And if Natural Resources owes us money or if we owe them money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| we need to make sure that we're contractually obligated to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| But I don't think that we need to sit here and rake somebody over the coals for two hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5914)|
| 1:38:40| when it was something that I think Mr. Evans did because he felt like in good faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| that they weren't being treated fairly, and he just made a judgment call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| And obviously, it was one that he didn't have the right to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| He should have come back to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| And I understand you're protecting the citizens and the citizens' dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| But I think that we need to let the courts decide with regard to some of these other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| And I think we've talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| Well, Commissioner, I don't mean to cut you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| I don't want to look back in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| I'll let the courtroom and a judge decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| We've got to look at going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| Either this company is making money and they should pay us what they owe us going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| or they need to get out of business and let us have somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| Then we need to talk about from this day forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| We'll let the court decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| Starting today, if they want to continue business in Knox County, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| or I'm going to have a resolution on county commission to try to terminate their contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| today they need to start paying their dollar fifty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| Why do they need to have their contract terminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| Because it says in the contract that this contract can be terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| I don't think that they're acting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| I don't think that their actions result in that because they weren't aware that that needed to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5984)|
| 1:39:51| They were under the impression that that was not how it was to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| But if we want them to pay now, if we want to start paying that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| we need to get Mr. Draper involved in that conversation and John Owings and renegotiate the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| Well, we've got a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| They just haven't went by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| I think I can show that they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| Commissioner Moore, if you're going to have a resolution drawn up, that will be the discussion for this argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6013)|
| 1:40:20| Folks, may I give you a piece of evidence that they knew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| One of the major things in my lawsuit is the statements that were made by John Evans at that time were not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| One of the statements they made is they didn't get the green waste represented in the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| Those numbers that were given to you in this David Draper letter from October the 12th of last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6033)|
| 1:40:40| and the numbers given to Bruce Weitrick do not agree with the numbers that were turned into the state recycling coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6040)|
| 1:40:46| Nick Lytle, in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| Now, according to his numbers, they got more than the green waste and the wood waste represented in the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| And according to Natural Resources' own letters dated April the 13th, 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| they got more waste than what was represented in the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| I've got conflicting numbers on all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| And some of them, they prepared both documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| Now, you all have a letter in front of you from David Draper, Lewis King, October 12th, 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6069)|
| 1:41:15| and they reported that they had a total sales of 29,512 yards for 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6075)|
| 1:41:21| That was reported after they found out we were after them on this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| But before we pointed out to them we were chasing this money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| they had already turned over to Sarah Hart, the green waste recycling coordinator, 47,738 yards of sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6088)|
| 1:41:36| Now, we have multiple sets of books and multiple sets of numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| Let me address that real quick so that it doesn't get too confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| because you can get bogged down in this pretty fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| is that the sales that they reported to Knox County, there's two types of sales they were doing up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6104)|
| 1:41:51| Some product they were bringing in as a wholesale product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| For instance, they had pine bark mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| They had colored mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| And I may be wrong about all the products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| When they reported sales to Knox County, they did not include those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| However, when we did a report to the state, those numbers were included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| because that's material that is being diverted from the landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| Because that pine bark, instead of going to the landfill, is going to somebody's yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6133)|
| 1:42:17| But when they reported sales to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| they did not report product that they brought in at a wholesale level and turned around and did a retail sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| They reported product that they essentially made from green waste and or compost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| Those sales were reported to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| They had discussed this matter previously with John Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| and essentially that's what he told them to do was to report the sales of product that they were processing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| not the wholesale product they were bringing in there, hence the discrepancies in the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| However, in reporting to the state, who wants a total number, we add the two together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6165)|
| 1:42:51| They probably still differ by plus or minus five percent, but that's the reason for the discrepancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6171)|
| 1:42:57| For the past two years or at least a year and a half, they manufactured their dyed mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| That doesn't hold water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| But also, if you look at the April 13, 2007 letter, they reported 7,002 yards of miracle mulch sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6182)|
| 1:43:10| And when you look at the David Draper letter, they're only reporting about 5,600 yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6190)|
| 1:43:15| There's about 1,400 yards skimmed off the top there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| I've got more examples of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| In addition to them getting the green waste, they also made a statement they never got their permit at the Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| They have a permit at the Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| Mr. Hayes, I'm going to give you five minutes to say what you have to say about revenue sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6208)|
| 1:43:34| That's what the issue is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| We need to come to a close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| Is there sales tax charged on the mulch when it's sold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| I suppose there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| That would be a good place to start if we looked at the sales tax records because I think that's going to be fairly accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6227)|
| 1:43:57| Mr. Draper, can you all get the sales tax records and make those available to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| so we can see a real picture of how much sales were done out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6242)|
| 1:44:10| I mean, we're just hearing two separate stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| and I know most folks above all else make sure their sales tax numbers are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| Whatever source, whatever the numbers, they're going to come to light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| I'm telling you, we have strayed so far here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| Yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| I'm going to take his deposition tomorrow, and I'm going to understand all his theories and all his paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6267)|
| 1:44:33| And we have an obligation under our contract to provide you documentation, and it will be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6273)|
| 1:44:39| And if the resolution is entertained that you're going to terminate us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| the first thing you're going to get back from us is a letter saying you're in breach of contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| And what the law director's memo that was published to you has said is we ought to get in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| and negotiate our differences and be done with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| and have your checks and balances to make sure it doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| But this is not a one-way street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| And, you know, you can listen to it all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| But it's in litigation, and we're going to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| But it's a two-way street, and we are not the only party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws080317forum?start=6310)|
