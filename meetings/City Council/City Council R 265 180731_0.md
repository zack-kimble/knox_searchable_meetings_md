| 0:03:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| We have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| So for the mayor's report tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| First, I want to remind everyone again that this Thursday, August 2nd, is election day for Knox County general election and for the state and federal primaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=196)|
| 0:03:27| There were more than 45,000 ballots that were cast during early voting, including absentee votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| That's great, but it's only about 19% of the registered voters in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| So I encourage everyone to vote on Thursday if you haven't already early voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| And if you have already voted, encourage your friends, family, members, and coworkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| On the last day of early voting, I had one of my family members get in the car and I drove him down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| So they didn't have to park, didn't have to worry they could run in and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| So let's encourage everybody to get out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| The polls will be open on Thursday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| If you're not sure where your polling place is, you can find information online at KnoxVotes.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=242)|
| 0:04:09| KnoxVotes.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| So remember, on Thursday, you have to go to your actual polling place, not to one of the early voting locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| They won't be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| Okay, we have an exciting groundbreaking that will be coming up next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| On Thursday, August 9th, at 10 a.m., we'll break ground for the first phase of our Magnolia Avenue streetscape project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=262)|
| 0:04:31| The ceremony will take place in front of the Cat Employee parking lot at the northeast corner of Magnolia Avenue and Jessamine Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=271)|
| 0:04:39| The first phase of the two-phase project will make upgrades to a section of Magnolia Avenue between Jessamine and Myrtle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=279)|
| 0:04:47| Improvements will include landscape center medians with designated left-turn lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| new stamped crosswalks designated on-street parking, traffic signal upgrades, street trees and landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| LED pedestrian and street lighting, and wider sidewalks and bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| This phase is scheduled to be finished by the fall of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| And at that time, the second phase will begin, which is from Myrtle Street to Bertrand Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| This is a long-awaited project, and I hope everyone can join us for the groundbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| Again, that is at 10 a.m. on Thursday, August 9th, at the corner of Magnolia and Jessamine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| And now I would like to ask Jesse Mayshark and Eric Freeland to come down here so we can see them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=327)|
| 0:05:39| And I know Council knows this, and we sent out a release on July 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| I can't believe we did that on my birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| That was not a happy birthday present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| But we announced that Jesse Mayshark, who has been with the city since December of 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=353)|
| 0:06:02| so when I first began, Jesse was our deputy director of communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| That's when Angela Stark was our director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| And so Jesse has been with us throughout the entire administration to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| and Jesse has tendered his resignation effective Friday, August 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| Maybe we can turn the clocks back or the calendar back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| But as you all know, he's had 20 years in journalism, and that's one of the reasons why I hired him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=384)|
| 0:06:35| It was a key reason because of his extreme knowledge, his depth of the issues, his understanding of policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=395)|
| 0:06:44| his understanding that for government to be good in communications, we had to be transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| We had to have high standards for that transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| And he's just been an unbelievable senior director of communications and government relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=415)|
| 0:07:02| He also worked with our state legislature, handled our federal issues too when they came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| Prior to being with us, he had been a reporter for Metropulse, the New York Times, the Knoxville New Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=428)|
| 0:07:16| and No Depression. I'm not familiar with that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| It's a music magazine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| Well, which brings me to the point, he's also our chief cultural officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| I've always called him that because he knows music, he knows all the bands, he knows so many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| Pop culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| He knows not just pop culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| Anyway, I always called him our chief cultural officer because he knew so much and added that to our work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=459)|
| 0:07:49| He really kind of helped the Poet Laureate program to begin, working with Lisa Zenni at the Arts and Culture Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| and really all things arts and culture related, Jesse has a love for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| So we have been, I feel like, I know I have, and I think the whole administration has benefited from having Jesse here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=481)|
| 0:08:09| for these six and a half years, and we wish him a lot of luck in his new adventure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| He'll be announcing that soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| But you are going to be terribly missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| He worked with every department, built a great communications team to work with every department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=499)|
| 0:08:27| And I just want to personally, in front of everybody here, thank you, Jesse, for the outstanding work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| Of course, communications there, you know, that phone is on 24-7 and literally, you know, seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=514)|
| 0:08:43| So you have been outstanding, and we will miss you dearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| I just want to very quickly say thank you so much for those words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=529)|
| 0:09:08| And, you know, for the last six and a half years, this has been just a terrific experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=548)|
| 0:09:15| I've really loved working in government as somebody who came into it with background as a reporter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| sometimes seeing government not function at its best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| It was great to be part of a team led very much by the mayor, but then with all of the people who you brought in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| and working for Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| I told Bill last week that working with him every day was sort of like getting a free college degree in political science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| And David, I mean, the whole team, the thing that's been impressive to me here is just the dedication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| the knowledge, and the innovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| And I tell people that, you know, people don't necessarily think of local bureaucracies as great centers of innovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| but the thing that I've seen here is a lot of encouragement for people to have ideas and to pursue them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| And I think, you know, there's examples in every single department in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| where people have thought creatively about how to better serve the people of Knoxville, which is what we're here to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| So it has been a tremendous privilege, and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| And I especially want to say thanks to the communications team that I've had here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| It's been just a great group of people to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| And one of the things that makes it easier for me to leave is that I know that things are in very good hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=628)|
| 0:10:35| with Eric Vreeland, who's going to be stepping into the role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| Thank you. And Jesse, so you know, now you step into the role like Eddie Maness and Christy Branscom did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| as the unpaid senior advisor. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| My cell phone number is staying the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| All right. And then I also now want to recognize Eric Rico Vreeland, who joined us in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| So when Jesse moved up to the senior director, we brought in our deputy director, Eric Vreeland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| He had been with the New Sentinel as a reporter and editor for 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| So he brought a ton of experience, somebody I also knew for a long time because of his role with the New Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| And he did a fabulous job as our deputy director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| So when Jesse announced that he was leaving, though we're sad to see Jesse leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| we are confident that Eric can step right into the role and do a great job for this last year and a half that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=689)|
| 0:11:37| And then for as long as the next mayor wants you, the next mayor would be smart to keep you on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=697)|
| 0:11:45| But anyway, I want to welcome publicly Eric to this new role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| He's already jumped in as Jesse is cleaning out his desk and passing on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| Eric's already jumped in, taking charge on several different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| And of course, he has to fill the number two spot as well. So he's working on that. Eric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| Well, thank you, Mayor and Bill and David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Like Jesse, it's one of the most rewarding jobs I've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| The integrity and the conscientiousness of city staff is just amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=735)|
| 0:12:23| And I think people in the public that interact with the guys cleaning up on Market Square or picking up brush on the side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=743)|
| 0:12:32| I think that professionalism is a well-earned reputation that people see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=752)|
| 0:12:39| And it's a pleasure to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| You know, one of Eric's specialties now is he can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about Fountain City Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=760)|
| 0:12:48| He worked very closely. He's one to dig in on the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| Every street closure, the Cumberland Avenue project when we did that, I mean, he really digs into the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=772)|
| 0:12:59| and then figures out how to communicate them in a way that people can understand when it's the complications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| So I really look forward to continuing to work with you and to work with you in this new role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| Eric. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| All right. You know, they're not usually in front of the cameras and behind the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| So I thought I'd just do that to them tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| OK, that's that's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=802)|

| 0:17:32| but I just wanted to add to some of the comments that I made last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| and thank you for indulging me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1056)|

| 0:17:43| and she just wasn't able to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1063)|

| 0:17:50| and particularly to Patrick Birmingham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1070)|

| 0:18:05| which is a historic Civil War site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| and there are some features and artifacts that they're interested in cataloging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| but also for the resources to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| So Ms. Faulkner wanted to make sure that I mentioned that before the vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1100)|

| 0:18:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1108)|

| 0:18:50| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| I just wanted to ask Becky to kind of give us these next three or CDBG grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| and then the next one after that is an ESG grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| and talk a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| We had a conversation about it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| but I just kind of want to reiterate some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Yeah, what we talked about were our performance criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| for the grants that we provide to different entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| and so every grant has expectations that we build into the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| and those are the numbers of people to be served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| or households to be served or houses to be repaired, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| So we do establish performance criteria in every one of our projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| We track that, and then we actually submit those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| through a federal grant system to the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| So they see exactly who's been served, the demographics of that population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| In this first one, they're in different sections in the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| but the numbers to be served in this item is 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| In the next few, in the next one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1203)|

| 0:20:18| 125 homes will be repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1218)|

| 0:20:26| which is a CAC program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| 170 households will receive rapid rehousing services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| And then for our lead grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| we have established the goal of 160 homes that will be remediated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| from lead-based paint and healthy homes hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| So any other questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| Well, I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| I think that's real important, and your staff monitors that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| and makes sure that that is delivered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| and to meet those guidelines and the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| So, you know, for that, I thank you for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| and taking care of those details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| and assuring that this money is well spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| and used appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| Yeah, Ms. Wade, so with the Item A specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| do you know how long we've been involved in that particular program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| I've never heard of that one before, so I just wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| The training program, this is our third year funding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| Okay, and so ballpark, we've had, I saw in the documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| the goal is 20 graduates or 20 certificate recipients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| So we had about 20 in the past each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| The goal is 31 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| I think it's been a little less in the previous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| It was just getting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| David Ault is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| If he could provide some more detail, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| Well, I can go ahead and ask my question for Mr. Ault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| So I just was curious how participants are recruited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| I know some of the programs are things that individuals could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| and apply for on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| So obviously, your program is providing support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| to get these folks enrolled and support beyond the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| So David Ault, 9957 Tierra Verde, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| So first, I always want to thank the Council and the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| and Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| So three years ago, we started a program with an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Could we train disadvantaged young adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| in construction and needed jobs in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| So we started with that as an idea, as a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| and we presented that to Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| And the idea was that we're recruiting some young adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| that are often overlooked in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| Lots of barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| If you'll notice in some of our data and statistics we collect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| a good majority of our young adults are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| So that's been a partnership with CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| and some of the funding and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| that we partner together to work and identify young adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| that are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| So our recruiting efforts go to the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| and a lot of young adults that are high school dropouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| or aged out of the system without a degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| without a high school diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| So these are some of the most at-risk young adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| in this community that we're taking on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| So it's a pretty heavy lift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| and we've got a great community of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| So trauma and addiction are big pieces of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| But job training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| So if we want to make a dent in opiates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| I remember talking to the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| about one of the biggest issues in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| We've got to give hope, and we've got to give jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| And so that's really the genesis of this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| and what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| And what specific aspects of construction trades?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| So it's pre-apprenticeship training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| So these are taking young men and young women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| that may have zero experience in construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| doing a pre-apprenticeship training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| by the Department of Labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| So it's a certification called the Home Builders Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| So there's only two programs in the entire country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| that the Department of Labor recognizes in construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| And we have those trainers that are certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| and certified by the Department of Labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Okay, and then so do we try and get them to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| for additional training beyond that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| The idea is to place them in jobs, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| And so construction, if you think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| construction teaches work ethic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| So this program is much bigger than teaching construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| We're taking on the mentoring role of folks like in your life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| that taught you work ethic, how to get to work on time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| how to dress on time, how to do a resume and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| But, yes, we're placing them in construction jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| That's one of the goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| We're really just placing them in employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| That's the key job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| We're really short on qualified individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| in the trades in this market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| They're cheering us on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| We have a database of employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| They'll take every single graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| that we can turn out from this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| They want our students, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Thank you for the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Any other questions from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1491)|

| 0:26:39| 11E is the resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| to execute any and all documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| necessary to accept a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1603)|

| 0:26:47| to provide property flood, earthquake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| and boiler and machinery insurance coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| for the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| and for an annual premium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| not to exceed $219,815.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1615)|

| 0:26:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| I thought I'd ask Director Fitzgerald| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| a couple of questions about this real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| This, what we're voting on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| allows the city to have a stand-alone policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| which is different than we've had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Christine Fitzgerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Employee Benefits Risk Management Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| We have been a named insured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| under the county's policy in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| and so this, that means we sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| share that policy limit of $500 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| which seems like a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| but our total insured values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| would be over $2 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| So if there were a catastrophic event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| there may not be enough funds to go around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| and there's no really formal arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| on how we would divide any funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| that we may, that they may get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| So having our own policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| I think is a better risk for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| Okay, so this gives us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| gives the city its own policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| the county has its own policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| so that eliminates any confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Okay, and then there's another part to this as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| which I think you may have just touched on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| which is we're doing entire replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| as opposed to a percentage replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Well, with this policy with Affiliated FM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| they removed the margin clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| so the clause that we had under our policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| with travelers said that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| the replacement cost of any damaged property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| would be 115%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| So that sounds like a great number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| but if your property value is underinsured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| you may not recoup the full cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| So removing that clause altogether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| would just ensure our replacement costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| as we have listed on our schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| So a better benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| So the 219,000, is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| how much, is there a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| of what we've been paying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| So this is a little tricky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| like when you look at the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| It's better to look at the rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| that we're being offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| So the rate is cheaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| that we'll pay to Affiliated FM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| But when you determine what your premium is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| it's based on your total insured value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| divided by 100 times the rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| So if you look at some of the documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| that may have been provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| what we got from Affiliated FM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| had a total insured value of like 606 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| and travelers was like 616 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Well, if they made assumptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| on our property schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| as to what those numbers could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| that's what we have to bind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| So it's really hard to compare premium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| and the schedule's kind of fluid too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| As we gain properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| we'll have to do an endorsement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| to either add that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| or remove a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| One example is we're double insuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| the carousel at the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| We need to remove that from our schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| because it's being covered someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| I think it's $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| So that's an endorsement we'll make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| almost immediately after we bind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| to reduce our schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| It does. It does. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| Thank you, Christine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=1811)|

| 0:35:08| for starters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Just over a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| I was sitting on my lawn chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| in my driveway in Vestal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| talking to my daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| It was about 10 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| when a young man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| came up my driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Because it was so dark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| I didn't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| that he had a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| When I got up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| to greet him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| he shot me in the torso| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| and then he ran away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| I believe one reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| I'm here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| able to tell you this story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| in this story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| only one shot was fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| One reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| that only one shot was fired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| neither I nor my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| own a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Another reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| only one shot was fired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| my next-door neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| who does own a gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| did not realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| that the pop sound he heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| that night was gunfire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| If he had known that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| he has already told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| that he would most likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| have come out of his house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| looking to shoot the shooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| If I or my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| would have had a gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| or my neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| had drawn on that shooter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| I think we all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| that likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| there would have been more shots fired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| more people shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| more tragedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2200)|

| 0:36:45| or somebody else's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| As I was shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| I went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| The shooter paused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| to look at me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| for a couple seconds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| before he turned and ran off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| into the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| I thought those were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| the last couple seconds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| of my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| because I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| he was going to finish me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| Instead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| he turned and he ran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| I strongly believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| if he had seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| that I had a gun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| he would have felt obligated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| to finish me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| I'm glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| the shooter didn't get shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| Still don't know who he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| I'll never be able to identify him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| in a lineup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| It was too dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| I came away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| from this experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| this much more than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| More guns equals less security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| I don't know all the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| of the resolution you're about to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| but I know it's being labeled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| as approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| a grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| applying for a grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| for very large sums of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| from the Trump administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| quote-unquote school security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| Of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| no one in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| opposes school security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| including me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| I have a seven-year-old grandson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| who goes to South Knox Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| He was there that night, incidentally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| We gathered him up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| Luckily, he was in my house at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| so he didn't see anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| like my daughter did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| We gathered him up and went to the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| We're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| I believe I survived this incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| in part to tell you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| about the consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| of our insecurity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| related to violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| We cannot expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| to be more secure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| in our persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| and our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| One minute, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| I've worked in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| of economic, social, and racial justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| for most of my adult life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| so I think I might know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| a thing or two about security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| that the community organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| I've helped build over the past 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| called SEED,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| is nothing stops a bullet like a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| Every week at SEED,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| we have young people coming into our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| ducking bullets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| by looking for help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| getting a stable, well-paying job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| More guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| does not equal more security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| More jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| equals more security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| I wish the young man who shot me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| had been shot himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| by my neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| by the police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| by another desperate young person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| I wish he had heard about SEED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| I saw the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| for the first time this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| about what you're about to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| I don't know how relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| or realistic it is to ask counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| to hit the pause button on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Really, I'm just looking for a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| to take the conversation about security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| to another level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| We in the nonprofit world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| are so often told to be true to our mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| and not get into the habit of chasing grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| that are not really about our mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| Please conclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| I shall conclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| I wonder if this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| I truly believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| if we spent the half million dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| at stake in this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| and offered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| instead did two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| Put it towards more job programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| and established a gun buyback program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| it would provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| at least as much security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| in the school and the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| as what this grant purports to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| I just want to ask Chief Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| to give us a summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| of what this is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| and what we're trying to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| and what it's going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| This grant is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| through the COPS Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Stop School Violence Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| School Violence Prevention Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| or SVPP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| It's a grant that we're applying for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| in conjunction with Knox County School Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| A small part of the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| will be used by the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| for training and grant administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| In fact, that's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| The training that we will go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| actually half of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| is in de-escalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| De-escalation, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| The rest of it will be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| by Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| mostly for training and equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| No weapons, no additional personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| So that's pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| what the grant's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| The matching portion will be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| by Knox County Schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| So none of the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| are to go toward...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| Your email that I got forwarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| from somebody else after 5 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| was that some of it would go to equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| What type of equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| I have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| Actually, it's Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| that's doing that portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| So they probably need to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| So what we're voting on is training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| that is de-escalation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| thank you, I'm glad I'm not the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| Yeah, half the training is actually de-escalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| It's actually a school resource officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| annual conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Okay, and are we providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| school resource officers from city funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| in the schools within the city bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| I know a former KPD officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| is over that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| and there's a mixture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| of sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| and city KPD officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| There is a mixture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| We had, gosh, I can't remember the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| it was after Columbine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| had got into school security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| We actually have, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| 12 officers assigned right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Normally we have about 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| We're in the middle and the high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| We work in conjunction with Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| to provide security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| and we actually do training together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| so that we're all on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| when something happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Okay, so we're not providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| or if an incident happens, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| Okay, because Paducas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| if I'm saying that correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| is this Paducas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| He assigns who goes where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| Is that how that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| that's not your purview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| Chief Thomas, there are right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| in the elementary schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| and the middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| one SRO officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| and in the high schools two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| You know, I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| what Chief Paducas has in the elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| I couldn't tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| I know as far as KPD officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| we have one in the high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| in most high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| A couple of them we have to overlap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| with the middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| so they cover a middle school and a high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| In the application I saw that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| both boxes were checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| that there might be more personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| that will be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| I don't have the application before me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| being funded through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| If it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| it would be through the county schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| but I don't believe that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| And then the training is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| just for the SRO officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| and the travel expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| all that is just SRO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| For the city, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| What I'm wondering about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| first off, everybody's concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| about school safety and our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| That's of utmost importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| What ends up happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| with the presence of SRO officers though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| is that the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| the rate of arrests within the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| and the school children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| instead of it being a teenage misbehavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| it ends up becoming an arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| And in the pursuit of protecting us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| from a potential shooter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| it does end up getting children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| into the school to prison pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| And that's a very large concern of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| especially as all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| there are going to be a lot of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| coming in from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| I'm wondering if we are planning ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| for how we're going to address that too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| as we increase security for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| Okay, I'd have to address specific incidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| but we are there to relationship build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| as well as provide security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| If there is a, if the law is broken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| we do address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Now that doesn't happen very often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| that I'm aware of but it does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| If you'd like to give me a specific incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| I'll be glad to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| I know that's not the intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| but that's what I see happen as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| When I was campaigning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| I was standing outside of a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| and watched a middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| watch two teenage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| teenager black students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| leaving in a police car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| And when I later inquired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| about what had happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| it was a school fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| which when I was in middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| that happened all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| and nobody was leaving in a police car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| So I can't look into that specific situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| I know when I was in middle school and high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| that's the way we worked out our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| Unfortunately with the prevalence of weapons now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| it sometimes escalates far beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| what I ever experienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| So I can't address that without knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| And then I'm wondering about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| training the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| instead of just police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Yeah, that would be up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| the Knox County School System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| Thank you, Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| I have a question for Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| or whomever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| My understanding is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| this is just to allow the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| to submit a grant application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| We're voting to allow the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| to submit the grant application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| Yes, that's what this vote is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| And so my understanding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| that if the funds are received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| a subcontract will need to be entered into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| Subrecipient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| A subrecipient grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| A subrecipient grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| That would come to this council for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| So that would be a second approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| And then beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| to subaward those grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| to Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| I know this to be true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| because I go to all these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| that will have to go to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| And then if approved at the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| it will go to vote with County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| And then if approved by County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| it would go to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| And in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| it would be reviewed by the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| I can't speak to the first part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| because you have greater expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| in what happens with the schools than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| I can assure you that that's what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| If there's a contract that goes to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| it'll come to us first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| Now you're talking about the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| The county's process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| So I just wanted to outline that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| and thank Mr. Held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| so much for being here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| because I think the points that you raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| about bringing a very valid perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| to the conversation about an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| that is so important to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| the safety of our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| and the safety of our community at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| that is a very important discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| and your perspective is so valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| The reason I outline the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| is because I think sometimes we forget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| that there are other bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| and this will come before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| So I'm grateful that perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| is coming to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| and we get to hear it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| and I hope that those other bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| will hear that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| as the process moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| So thank you for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=2951)|

| 0:50:33| who has a similar contract for ongoing services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3033)|

| 0:52:18| My wife is a police officer with KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| And right before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| she got her law degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3144)|

| 0:52:28| we got married| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| and we started trying to have a baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| It took us a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| and it took us in vitro fertilization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| but after a failed attempt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3161)|

| 0:52:57| are parents of triplets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| What runs through your head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| when you find that out is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| how am I going to afford this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Am I going to be able to pay for their college?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| Am I going to be able to buy their food?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| Do I have to buy a new house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| Do I have to buy a new car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| Do I have to buy multiple cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| Yeah, so once you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| as a father...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| We have our EMS people standing by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| Once you get over being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| kind of self-centered in those thoughts as a father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| you start thinking about your wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| and your soon-to-be children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| Is she going to be okay through this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| How big are those babies going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| Is anybody in danger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| And yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| so once I got through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| I started thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| okay, I can work through all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| and I started looking into the parental leave program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| at the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| I didn't expect that to be a barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| to this experience for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| The city offers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| and I just checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| to make sure I wasn't misinterpreting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| the city of Knoxville offers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| four months of unpaid leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| Within that four months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| you can use up all your sick leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| you can use up all your vacation times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| but that's what I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| That's what the city offers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| to the women working for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| is four months of unpaid leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| My wife is guaranteed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| to have a cesarean section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| I didn't know what that meant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| so I started looking it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| I hate to use the term research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| but I researched this on YouTube.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| I watched the procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| and a cesarean section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| is just a euphemism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| for cutting a foot-long hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| in your stomach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| and then cutting through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| a foot-long hole in your uterus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| and pulling, in my wife's case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| three babies out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| You have to have blood on standby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| and you're likely to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| After that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| I'll have three babies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| and they're guaranteed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| to be born at least five weeks early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| They're all going to be premature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| underweight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| and they're all going to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| four weeks in a neonatal intensive care unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| What the city is offering my wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| is four months of unpaid leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| My wife's extremely lucky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| because she's part of a two-income household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| She's also extremely lucky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| because she comes from a family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| that's very supportive, very loving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| and has the means to help her along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| if she doesn't have a regular paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| I can't imagine what it would be like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| for any woman working for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| without those advantages in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| That's what I'm urging you to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| is to change this parental leave policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| I can't look at young women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| and urge them to come work for this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| in an honest way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| If I looked at a young woman and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| hey, come work for the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| you're really well qualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| because I'm going to have to tell her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| if you plan on having a family in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| your livelihood's going to be at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| So, yes, I don't expect the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| any time soon to become a European country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| where you get six months or a year paid leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| regardless of your gender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| But it would be a great start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| if you could incorporate into your next budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| Know that you have women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| and that you need more young women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| in this city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| Realize that they're going to, on average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| going to have 1.8 babies in their lifetime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| in their career, and budget for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| I worked out the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| It's not onerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| I think it does fit in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| And, yeah, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| So thanks for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| Thank you very much, Mr. Brett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| And good luck to your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| Okay, next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| That's quite a life-changing event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| that is about to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| So now we'll hear from the second person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| signed up, which is Lori Clenaris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| Thank you for being here, Ms. Clenaris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| Please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| Lori Clenaris, 719 Latrell Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| I'm the owner of Cafe 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| and I want to thank you for your opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| for this opportunity to come talk to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| I kind of want to share with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| what it's like to be an owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| on Market Square these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| Every day, I am confronted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| with the aggressive homeless situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| And let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| The police force and the city workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| that work Market Square do their very best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| They are very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| They are very accommodating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| But they are overworked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| and cannot in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| handle the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| that has become unbearable, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| Just this past weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| I had two guests leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| because they did not appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| the homeless gentleman sitting on the bench| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| yelling profanities at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| And I, as an owner and as a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| don't feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| calling the police to handle somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| who's yelling profanities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| when there's so many other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| for the police to be doing, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| This past month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| I've had three written reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| on TripAdvisor and Yelp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| all saying how great their experience was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| but they would never return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| because they don't want to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| the situation on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| The other problem we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| is the ever-growing unsupervised youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| Two weeks ago, I had a full patio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| Some youth ran around the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| through firecrackers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| There was a stampede of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| running from the patio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| tables overturned, dishes broken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| running into the restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| because they thought it was gunfire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| I had hysterical women crying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| I had a full restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| and I was trying to deal with this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| called the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| It was about 45 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| before they were able to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| At this point, the youth were long gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| but if you go on Market Square on the weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| there is many, many unsupervised youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| all over the square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| Sunday morning, I got a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| from a guest who was there Saturday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| He said they were leaving the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| He had a great experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| but a gentleman on the bike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| who I did call about later that night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| because I saw him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| was literally blocking the passing of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| as they were trying to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| and demanding money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| This gentleman gave them money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| because his wife was terrified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| and they said, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| they would not be back to Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| So I'm letting you all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| the property owners on Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| that have invested lots of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| time, energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| and effort to build up downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| are now being confronted with a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| that is becoming truly unbearable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| You cannot sit on the patio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| at Cafe Four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| without being cursed at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| yelled at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| confronted for the food on your table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| Honestly, I have become a police force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| walking through my restaurant on the patio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| trying to shoo them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| I have paid homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| to move to the other side of the square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| tripled that with the buskers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| that have become obnoxious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| the ones that have amplifiers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| that are there when the police are not around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| And again, I am not criticizing the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| They are doing the very best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| But it has become an overwhelming problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| And unless you're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| I don't think you can imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| what we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| The police have encouraged us to call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| and when I feel like it's a dangerous situation, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| But I'm not going to bother them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| with just obnoxious gentlemen or women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| who I feel like I can brush along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| But I'm saying that all the energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| that has been put in to build up downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| is being diminished by this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| And I think it's gotten to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| where it's escalating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| and something needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| So I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| And are you going to be here for a few minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| I'll be glad to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Okay, maybe we can get the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| and police and Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| I see Rick is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| Have a little huddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| I will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| CBID just recently hired a security guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| And bless his heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| he's an elderly gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| And I can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| it's ineffective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| We'll be finished in just a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Okay, council, that is the end of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| If there's no other business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| then we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180731?start=3731)|
