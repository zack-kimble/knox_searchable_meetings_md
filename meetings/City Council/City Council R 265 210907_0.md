| 0:11:07| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Mr. Brace, I'm not sure if you can answer it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| I don't know who it would go to, but how do – is there a set maintenance plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=672)|
| 0:11:22| How do we work our way down making property improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| Chief Sharp, you may need to answer, but I didn't know if it came from you or from operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| So one of you take a stab at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Yeah, it's both of us working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| We started this several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Our stations, we have several of them that were built in the early 60s, some even earlier than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| but really didn't have a whole lot of maintenance done on them over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| So we started a project where we're trying to renovate each station over a year to two years to try to get one station done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=708)|
| 0:11:57| so that as we work through, eventually we'll get to all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| We've already renovated three, and this is our fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| And it's based primarily on the needs of the station, which is in the worst condition and needs the most improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=724)|
| 0:12:11| I assume that's the case, but I thought it would be nice to hear this on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| that there is a prioritization list based on need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| and we're working our way through all fire stations to get them up to current standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| And when do we think that should all be completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| I know you said how many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| Yeah, if we could get one done a year, I mean we're still 15 years out to get them all renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| Which begs the question of then they'll all be behind again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| Yeah, and so that's really my longer question in terms of how do we do the deferred maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| not have so much deferred maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| And I know equipment changes and everything changes in trying to keep up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| So I'm glad that we're thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| It just sounds like we may need to move a little faster if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| Yes, it was put off for a remaining year. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=787)|

| 0:13:14| I have a similar question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| Understanding maintenance is hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| How often do we consider new stations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| How often do we build new stations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| As population increases, how often do we recalibrate our footprint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| Yeah, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| We have not had a new station built since the early 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| And we're actually looking at that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| We're working on a project with MTAS to look at our fire station need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=821)|
| 0:13:49| and looking to see where we may need some additional stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| And that's a project we're working on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=833)|

| 0:14:29| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Yeah, I think this is, let's see, a question for Chief Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| Just how does this question end up being used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| Is this something that we're sharing and using with Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| That this is coming through a grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Yeah, this is part of the Homeland Security grant, which has been in process since about 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| It's a state grant that then distributes to the different Homeland Security districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| And then each county, based on the population, gets a certain amount of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| And so then each first responding agency within that county then gets a certain piece of that pie too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=905)|
| 0:15:13| And so this is the amount that the Knoxville Fire Department has been allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| So we use it for either, it depends on what the emphasis is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| but either for hazmat equipment or urban search and rescue equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| I see that, so it's equipment that does, like, gas detection, search and rescue, I'm assuming, like, holes in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=930)|
| 0:15:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| So this could be used on any hazmat incident or any structural collapse or any major disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| It's just equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| We have an urban search and rescue team that specializes in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| And then we also have a hazmat team that specializes in dealing with any hazardous material emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=955)|

| 0:19:18| for their continued leadership for this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| and for council's continued support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| This is a huge and a very important investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| in a major permanent affordable housing development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| right in the heart of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| I go by there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| It's so exciting to see the progress being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| And this is a site that used to have 129 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| that had gotten quite dilapidated over the decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| And our city investment supports the development of 438.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| So we're going from 129 to 438 affordable homes for families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| with a guaranteed right of return for all former residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| And as you know, the location is just amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| It's really walking distance to an elementary school, a middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| to the Change Center, to jobs, to transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1204)|

| 0:20:19| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Yeah, so I think it's just important to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| this particular expense is for the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| Is that like sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| Is that stormwater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Ms. Wade, maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| Yes, Director Becky Wade of Housing and Neighborhood Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| Collaborate on what all is included in the infrastructure part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| I'm Becky Wade, Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| Yes, Ms. Ryder, all of the above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| Utilities, sidewalks, lighting, green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| and included in this phase is the extension of a boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| that will cross First Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| and connect the site with Georgia Avenue in the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| Which was cut off previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Well, yeah, there's no way to get across the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| So is it a bridge that will cut the vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Jim Hatfield from KCDC is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| and he could provide some more detailed information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1280)|
| 0:21:29| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Jim Hatfield, KCDC 901 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| So to answer your question about the bridge specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| this would be a new bridge extending the boulevard that is currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| you can see it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| It's not paved yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| It will be paved in the next couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| but it would be extending that over First Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| and connecting with Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| So for both vehicle and pedestrian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| So we're in the design stages or about to enter the design stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| The idea would be to have a greenway on one side of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1317)|

| 0:22:02| and then the bridge for vehicular traffic as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| all part of the same structure across First Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1329)|

| 0:22:12| Any other questions for Mr. Hatfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| I'm really pleased to see the way the corner has been redesigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| It's much more pedestrian friendly up where it hits Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| It looks great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Seeing no further questions, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1347)|

| 0:22:53| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| We have some people signed up to speak to this on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| First, Marjorie Thigpen Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| You're signed up to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| If you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| get your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| My name is Marjorie Thigpen Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| and I live at 5606 Green Valley Drive in Holston Hills in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| My husband and I bought our home in Holston Hills in June of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| and I'm here tonight to urge you to vote yes to the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| to build affordable housing on the Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| I have spoken to many of my neighbors who also urge you to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| We are asking you to vote yes for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| Number one, it will just be good for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| In the 14-plus years that I have lived in Holston Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| the property that we are talking about has sat vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| and has continued to deteriorate over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| Nice, well-cared-for apartments will be a welcome improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| to the potential nuisance that now sits at that address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| The second reason is that people need affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| so that families are not stressed and neighborhoods are stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| People all over our city need affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| and I have heard some in my neighborhood say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| why should we build more affordable housing in East Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| Why not build it in Sequoia Hills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| Well, I hope that when a developer does acquire property in Sequoia Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| or another West Knoxville neighborhood and wants to develop affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| the city will fund that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| and the city council people representing those districts will push for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| and I know many in West Knoxville that will come out to support affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| But tonight we are not talking about Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| We are talking about Chilhowee Hills and Holston Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| and many other neighborhoods in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| And the fact is that many more families in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| are struggling to afford housing and are getting priced out of a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| that they have lived in all their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| This is not because people are not working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| This is because wages in our city are incredibly low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| and jobs that are essential for our day-to-day living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| And here's an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| I'm thinking about the people who work at the Kroger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| just across the street from the property we are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| In the checkout line a month or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| the checker, a young man in his mid-20s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| was so excited that he could apply to live in the new affordable apartments on Holston Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| He couldn't believe that he would be able to afford rent on his own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| He is a good employee that I have seen regularly in that store for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| Another night in the checkout line, I had worked a very long day and evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| and was feeling very tired and heading home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| And I was commiserating with the woman checking me out about how we were both so tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| And I asked her, what time do you get off and get to go home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| And she said she would be leaving there to go to her second job at McDonald's at 10 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| And I said, oh my gosh, you have two jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| And she said, no, I have three jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| I pick up shifts at the Dollar General when I can also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| This is a woman with a husband, also working, and children at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| And she had worked at that point in that Kroger for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| Hardworking parents should be able to afford housing without working three jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| And it is not just people working at the Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| It's janitors in our schools, daycare providers, bank tellers, receptionists in offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| These are examples of people who are often earning less than 50 percent of the area median income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| paying too much for housing, who will benefit from this affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| The third reason that I ask you to vote yes to this funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| is that I want to continue to live in a welcoming neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| that does not have a mindset of fear and scarcity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| There is enough for all of us to live and do well together in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| I have heard that some are worried about increased crime and decreased property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| I am a homeowner, and of course I want my property to hold its value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| and hopefully one day even get a good return on my investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| But we can care about our investments while also caring for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| And plenty of studies show that this is possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| that affordable housing does not increase crime and decrease property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| And I'll tell you, though, about my own experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| When my husband and I were starting our family, we lived in Houston in affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| On one side of the apartment complex, there was an old, well-established neighborhood of single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| and on the other side, a small strip mall, including a grocery store and a drugstore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| I can't help but think about this apartment complex because of the way it was situated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| even though the density was much greater of those apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| So between my husband working part-time, small loans for medical school, and my part-time job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| we could afford our apartment and still have time and resources for our infant and toddler daughters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| In the apartment above us and beside us, single mothers were raising elementary-age kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| senior citizens on fixed income lived across the courtyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| That affordable housing gave my family our start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| and let others live and work without having to struggle too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| We used the nice parks in the adjoining neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| My daughter got to go to a really good school in kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| Crime was not a problem in our neighborhood, and over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| property values of those homeowners have skyrocketed while the apartments remain affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| Vote yes to this resolution. We need more affordable housing in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| It will benefit all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Next person signed up to speak is Ms. Elizabeth Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| Ms. Johnson, if you could state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| and you'll have up to five minutes to talk to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| My name is Elizabeth Johnson. I live at 3923 Linden Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1715)|

| 0:28:46| I currently live less than one mile from the proposed affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| I urge you to vote yes to fund this important affordable housing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| I am the co-president of Justice Knox, a coalition of 19 faith congregations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| who are pushing for the development of affordable housing all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| Tonight, though, I want to focus on my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| I have lived there all my life, and I know many other families that have also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| I know families through my church and other families that I grew up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| that own homes and rent homes in the Chihuahua neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| Austin Hills, and surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| We need affordable housing in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| Incomes are low, and hardworking families are paying more than 30% of their low income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1776)|
| 0:29:43| and sometimes more than 50% for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| If we want to have a safe, healthy community, families cannot be making these choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1787)|

| 0:29:58| or pay for their cars to get to work or all of the things that their children need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1798)|
| 0:30:05| When I retired a few years ago, I could not find a house or an apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| that I could afford to rent in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| even though I had worked all my life and got a small pension from FedEx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| My adult daughter, who is a small business owner, owning and running her own hair salon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| could not find an affordable place either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| So we chose to live together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| But what if something happened to me or her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| I would need an apartment just like the ones that you are proposing on Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| In my work with Justice Knox Ministry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| I've had the opportunity to listen to other people's stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| and experiences related to affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| A young man in his early 30s in my congregation who grew up in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| works a good job but is scared to start a family because the cost of living is so high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| I know of a grandmother from another congregation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| who had to sleep on the floor of a family member's house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| because she could not find affordable housing or apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| And she had a Section 8 voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| And she worked full time as a daycare provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| but could not find housing that she could afford outright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| or one that would take her voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| I could tell you many other stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| Housing is the key to a healthy community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| Please vote yes to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Next person signed up to speak on this item is Carrie Nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| Ms. Nicely, you can start by stating your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| and you have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| My name is Carrie Nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| I live at 5912 Holston Hills Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| and I would like to speak in opposition to this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| Let me make it clear that I agree with my neighbors who just spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| that affordable housing in our city is an extreme crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| Just a few short years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| Knoxville was the most affordable place to live in the entire country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| That has drastically changed in a few short years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| And with the recent eviction moratorium, that's likely to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1951)|
| 0:32:41| I'm not naive to the ongoing problem of homelessness populations in our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| and that the KCDC's shortest waiting list is four to six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| I'm speaking in opposition to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| because this is a long forgotten part of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| It is not the heart of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| It is the very, very outskirts of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| There is no community development that's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| and there are people in this neighborhood that need help now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| People who own homes who are just this close to losing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| There are no jobs in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| so transportation will be an issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| As a former substitute teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| I can say that the schools in this area struggle greatly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| and need our support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| So I'd like to ask who benefits from this housing project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| because it's not the residents that currently live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| that are suffering in poverty already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| We are not supporting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| It's not the schools with crumbling infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| large classes in desperate need of parental and community support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| It's not the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| because there are vacant properties all along Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| Who profits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| A property developer profits from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| We will be giving him $2 million to develop this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| and charge people rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| We are not subsidizing rent for people who live in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| and we are consolidating low-income and poverty-stricken areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2063)|
| 0:34:32| As somebody that has lived in East Knoxville my entire life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| as a graduate of Vine Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| I care greatly and passionately about the people in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| I am not worried about crime rates increasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| like people have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| That is not my intention of speaking in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| People in this area are priced out of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| People in this area are priced out of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| because the city money is continually given to developers instead of residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2102)|
| 0:35:10| If we are not investing in property ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| and we are not investing in the people that already live in our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| we will not see a rise in our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| So I ask if this does pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| what is the city going to do to develop this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| What is the city going to do to help the vacant lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| that have housed many homeless encampments throughout the last year and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| What is the city going to do to develop crumbling sidewalks in the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| What is the city going to do to bring support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| to the people that could potentially live in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| Without support, we are not giving people a step up in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| We are just continuing to charge them rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| and put money into the pockets of our wealthiest members in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| So I strongly ask you to reconsider this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| I just want to say that I believe this is a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| Coming from the Affordable Rental Development Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| which you all have been very supportive of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| it's going to turn a vacant and blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| that's along a CAT transit line into 80 affordable rental apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| I also want to recognize that the contract that you're voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| has income limits and an affordability period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| that reflect the parameters of the Affordable Housing Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| So thanks to Justice Knox and the financial partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| and housing and real estate and other people who participated in that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| I think this is one of the things that we've been working on very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| So thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| I want to thank the speakers that came to talk to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| And I also agree that this blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| has been an eyesore in our community for too many years, too many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| And I personally pass by it every day when I leave home to go to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| and when I come home every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| That is how close it is to where I live and my part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| And so to see this being now utilized to provide affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| two- and three-bedroom housing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| I think it is going to be a great addition to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| to be able to allow folks to have, and families potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| to have a safe environment to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| Walking distance to schools, the library, CAC East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| grocery stores, pharmacies, physician's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| There are two churches, one next door and one in walking distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| And probably one of the best Mexican restaurants in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| Habanero's, across the street, that I might add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| But again, this is a start when we talk about redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| when we talk about affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| and spreading it out across our communities and our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| And so I personally am very excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| to finally see something positive being done with this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| because it has sat and deteriorated for far too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| And so because of that and what it's going to bring to affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| I will be supporting it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| Yes, I would underline a lot of what my colleague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| Vice Mayor McKenzie said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| And I strongly support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| I think it's a good step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| It is taking blighted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| It's getting it back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| And the proximity of it, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| the infrastructure is close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| It's on a bus line with ease of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| There's opportunities, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| for employment along the corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| and the fact that there's a commercial area there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| where people, as my colleague said, can walk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| And I think this is the kind of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| that we should definitely support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| So I'll be voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| Thank you. Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| I want to address some of the questions that one of the speakers had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| Becky Wade, would you come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| Can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| I think you have a packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| If you could speak into your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| We get a little bit more detail a little earlier than most folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| I wanted to make sure that the public's aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| of some of the income restrictions that are associated with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| as it relates to average median income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| Can you describe the subsidy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| or subsidized vouchers that are accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| or the dynamic associated with holding rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| at a certain percentage of income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| as it relates to the average in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| and how long that has to be sustained as part of this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| Sure. Becky Wade, Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| All 80 units that are to be developed are affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| That means that they're income restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| People moving in there have to have incomes at or below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| 80% of the area median income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| But then it's further restricted that 40% of those units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| are restricted even further to 60% AMI or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2435)|
| 0:40:43| The entire development is allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| and oftentimes does take housing choice vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2447)|
| 0:40:54| from tenants who bring those, and those pay the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| And so that income criteria for housing choice vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| is at 50% of area median income or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| So while it serves a range of incomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| it is focused primarily on the lower end of the spectrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| Also, the affordability period for the development is 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| So this will remain a solid, affordable housing development for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| And I believe as part of the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| average median income is recalculated every year or every so often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| and therefore rents have to stay within proximity to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| throughout the 30-year term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| Yes. The rents are set annually by HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| So those are fair market rent values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| Those are federal requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| I was just going to say I support this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| And to speak to some of the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| the city does not develop property, does not develop housing itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2519)|
| 0:42:06| It helps incentivize people to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| That's what this fund is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| Private developers are taking a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| We are incentivizing that this not be market rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| that it be affordable housing by giving this $2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| to help keep it affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| So I think that is the way the city invests in rehabilitating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| and renovating and rejuvenating parts of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| So there's economic factors that go in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| and this is the way the city tries to incentivize people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| to build what we would like them to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| Yeah, I have a couple of questions for Ms. Wade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| and maybe anybody who's representing the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| So the affordability period that you just touched on is 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| In the past, some of the projects that have been funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| not by this fund because we haven't had this much of a fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| were typically industry standard was 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Yes, we've had some at 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| The new ordinance that was passed by City Council in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| has required a 30-year affordability period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| Any development that's receiving tax credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| has to keep it affordable for 15 and often re-evaluates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| and basically refinances that for an additional 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| So 30 years is not uncommon at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| for low-income housing tax credit developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| I want to touch on a couple of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| that may be all over the place here for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| that got brought up by one of the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| I just want to point out that I've received zero e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| in opposition to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| So there's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| One of the things I would like for Ms. Wade for you to touch base on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| that aren't specific to this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| are investments in homeownership in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| and in commercial development in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| We have a façade grant program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| We have programs for people to do owner-occupied rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2677)|
| 0:44:44| The things that I hear out of East Knoxville and Holston Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| are about the blight of the Stovers property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| The Holiday Inn property has been there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| People are really wanting to see these properties redeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| and not blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| So can you touch on kind of high-level different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| like I just mentioned and whatever I might not have mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| of ways that we invest in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| including the Burlington funding that we approved tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| Yeah, I can't speak specifically about the Burlington funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| although I can say that the city's invested in various businesses in Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| through the façade improvement program over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| I believe there are maybe six or seven buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| that have been improved on the exterior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| because of the city's commercial façade improvement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| And we also invest in individual homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| through our owner-occupied rehab program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| We do that all over the city, East Knoxville included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| for low-income homeowners who need improvements done to their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| We do that with emergency repairs, minor repairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| and whole house repairs that brings the entire property up to code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| We pay rent while they are living somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| while their house is rehabilitated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| and then they come back home and can live there the rest of their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| in a very stable, sustainable home that's energy efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| So we do invest in these other properties other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| I hope that answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| Yeah, I think it's important to talk about that in relation to this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| and kind of tie everything that's going on in East Knoxville together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| So from the concern of folks in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| that properties out there aren't getting invested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| like the Stovers property as a specific, those are private properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| The city has programs where someone could come to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| with a proposal to redevelop that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| if someone were moving forward to do that for commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| or other investment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| Yeah, I'm going to let Ms. Welch address that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| Yes, Councilwoman Ryder, if there were commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| that there were an owner interested in redeveloping that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| and they came to us with a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| we certainly would want to sit down with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| and talk about how we could partner with them on that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| Okay, because I get a lot of questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| why is no one investing in certain properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| or the vacant and blighted commercial properties along that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| And so I think it's important that we put it out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| that there are programs if someone has an interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| or is there ways that we can, we have programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| where we can incentivize investment in those vacant and blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| that are sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| If there's an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| Yes, Councilwoman Ryder, if there is an interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| and yes, we would want to sit down with that owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| We have programs that can assist property owners with redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| It is a partnership, so it requires partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| and investment on the private sector end as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| Councilmember Ryder, I just wanted to add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| obviously the city's main investments across the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| including East Knoxville are in infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| and incentivizing and catalyzing and facilitating private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| And we've already been discussing some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| But we also as a city go above and beyond that invest in the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| We support community schools, many of which are in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| We support workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| So people can improve, so we can help provide people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| with some help with housing and affordability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| but also help them improve their skills and talents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| so they can earn more money and be able to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| eventually buy their own homes and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| So I just wanted to mention, you know, we have investments in parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| and greenways in East Knoxville, Morningside Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| East Knoxville Greenway, Magnolia Avenue streetscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| other infrastructure type projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| but investing in the people side of things is important too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| And we do that to go above and beyond what we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| required our fundamental goals are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| So just wanted to mention that because I think that's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| and sort of alluded to in the earlier discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=2966)|

| 0:53:19| the staff made a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| planning commission heard it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| and they recommended approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| but based upon the wrong reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| One-year plan amendment requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| require a significant change in the development pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| or the completion of a public improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| In this case, the development pattern has changed recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| along Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| Parcels have been developed or are being developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| from vacant land to office or commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| However, that pattern is along Westland Drive only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| and it doesn't extend as far back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| as the land for which this zoning is requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| The proposed request expands the boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| of non-residential zoning and land use classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| deeper into the parcel beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| where these designations transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| into residential properties on adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| And most importantly, the reason given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| by planning commission to approve this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| was recent changes in the property adjacent to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| which is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| But on September 24th, 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| Knox County Commission approved requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| of the adjacent property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| for a change in the sector plan, a change in the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| to allow storage units to be placed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| And that was done before your applicant came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| six months later and approached this body saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| I want the same equivalent changes in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| And you all did in March of 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| add a one-year plan change and a sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| and rezoned this applicant's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| that was right next to Westland Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| to allow equivalent zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| and equivalent sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| to allow him a commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| in fact, the highest commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| CH1, highway commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| Now, that was in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| This year, your applicant has come back and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| I want to take the back part of my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| and I wanna change it to office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| Pushing that back, pushing that office zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| back into the residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| that is the South side of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| And there's nothing that's changed to warrant that change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| that sector plan change or that zoning amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| You have a zoning court section 16.1.3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| subsections one through three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| that have conditions that must be met for all rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| And it must be necessary because of substantially changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| or changing conditions in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| There has been nothing that has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| since March of 2019 that allows such a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| Rezoning should be based on the entire range of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| So to take this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| and to push the zoning into an office zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| South of the creek, pushes it into the residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| where my clients, Ms. Boyce, Mr. Woodall live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| and have neighbors that live back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| And to push that zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| back into the residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| does not meet the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| does not meet the one-year plan amendment requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| And it also would interject uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| office uses back into residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| such as daycare centers, broadcasting facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| drug and alcohol treatment facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| financial institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| All of these are allowed back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| And what you've got is you've got an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| that's down in a hole on the South side of the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| that your applicant wants to change to an office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| It simply doesn't meet those requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| and it must meet all of the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| It says the proposed amendment shall not adverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| That concludes your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| I'm done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| And so I would request that you would deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| the proposed sector change and the office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| Ms. Boyce, you've signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| If you wish to speak, you may, if you don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| that's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| And Mr. Woodall, also you signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| If you, if either of each, if you want to take a turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| you may, if you decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| There is no rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| This is not a zoning appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| This is just your opportunity to speak that you speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| and then there's no rebuttal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| All right, council members, they are declining to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| So it's your turn to discuss this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| That concludes public forum on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| Mayor, I think the developer hadn't had a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| I might call on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| Did you all not sign up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| If council members have a question for someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| we don't have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| Can you tell me what their names are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| Is there someone here who's the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| Would the applicant like to come and discuss your position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3541)|
| 0:59:10| You could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| Andy Turner, 1440 Zachary Taylor Road, resident of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3553)|
| 0:59:22| Dr. Smith purchased the property several years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| and I just came in to be a partner this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| And kind of our goal with this plan is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| and if you've seen the property on a map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| it's a very narrow, small property, a lot of setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| And our intention, or my intention is to put an office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| I'm an orthodontist and I'd like to have an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| I actually live in, my property touches the same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3593)|
| 1:00:01| There's four homes that touch the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| and three of us have no issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| But as we looked at the size of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| that we could put onto the location with the setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| we needed some more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| So by adding office in the back would allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| to kind of, to have more office space back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| so I could have maybe a lab and a few other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| Yeah, but we're looking at something low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| There's not gonna be any traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| This is just a doctor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| And quite frankly, I mean, I live, my family lives there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| my kids, we live right next to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| I have no intention on having anything loud and crazy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| right next to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| Any further questions for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| Mr. Turner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| I've got some questions for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| Okay, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| Director Brooks, we've had some discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| about staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| Can you talk to us about what staff did recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| in your review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| Yes, Amy Brooks, Knoxville, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| You know, as has been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Planning Commission did recommend approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| of all three applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| but staff recommendation to Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| was to deny the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| So staff did not recommend approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| for the plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| because we did not find any of the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| for an amendment could be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| And the same would apply for the rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| And additionally, if you look at the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| there's a line of separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| between the commercial and residential land use classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| and the properties along the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| of Westland Drive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| In addition of the office zone on this portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| of the real property would extend the boundary deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| into the site and encroach into that residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| Okay, and can you go over with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| the way that staff came to that conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| what you reviewed and looked at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| In terms of the criteria that we used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| So in terms of the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| and this would apply for the one-year plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| So changes of conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| warranting amendment of the land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| introduction of significant new roads or utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| that were not anticipated in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| and make development more feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| We found no changes to either one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| An obvious or significant error omission in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| And then trends and development population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| or traffic that weren't reconsideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| of the original proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| And so this is the one where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| you know, as staff, we didn't recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| that the change in use along Westland Drive there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| was enough to warrant an additional extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| into further into the ag zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| but that's where the planning commission found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| that those changes did warrant a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| and a one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| Is, Director Brooks, the change that you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| was that something that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| as Mr. Klein talked about just a minute ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| prior to the rezoning that council approved back in 2019?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| The planning commission referenced specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| the new self-storage facilities that were being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| And those would have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| would have come after the 2019 rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3812)|
| 1:03:42| So those occurred after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| but those do occur along the boundary there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| at Westland Drive, not back where the residential part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| Well, you know, I remember these negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| with these same parties from back in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3841)|
| 1:04:07| so two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| I think staff's recommendation here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| is certainly impactful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| And, you know, I also struggle to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| what the change is that's occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| And I think I'll open it up to my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| to have some discussion too before I make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| Council Member Testerman and then Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| Just in looking at the maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| I think I struggle a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| only because looking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| obviously at the other three corners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| which is talked about at this intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| you've got office zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| But having the backside of that property, which is LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| I guess I struggle with that too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| in the sense that is anybody really going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| build a house, you have to drive through a commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| you have to drive through a commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| to get to it and the west side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| but it's Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| I just don't see that that's a very enticing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| piece of property for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| And to that point, you know, office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| you know, we know is generally a good transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| between residential and commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| and to that point, I just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| I'm struggling with why that would not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| you know, an appropriate use of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| It's such a small sliver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| That said, I understand the stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| the hilltop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| I would like to ask, you know, at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| the cost of construction to mitigate those circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| may be prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| I don't know that, but the onus would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| on the developer and obviously not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| So I just, it's such a small piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| that looks like they found a use for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| since the rezoning two years ago as a good transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| but Director Brooks, you may wanna offer something to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| but I'm kind of struggling to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| you know, why it would be so inhibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| Council Member Testament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| I don't know that I can add anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| but I know those are the same conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| that were had at Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| You know, what else could I do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| So what all the points that you brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| are all the points that the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| debated as well before they came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| to their recommendation of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| One is a follow on to Councilman Testament's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| What can be built in an area under hillside protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| I guess Director Brooks, if you could answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| They would need to run a slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| to determine how much of the site that they could disturb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| So, I mean, in terms of what they can build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| you know, the only limitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| of the hillside and ridge top plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| would be the limitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| of what the disturbance limits would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| So it's not related to the type of building or the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4054)|
| 1:07:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4061)|
| 1:07:41| Mr. Swanson, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| Legally, how does the specific change in condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| cited by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| impact this body's decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| I'm not sure I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| Well, the specific change in condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| cited by the Planning Commission for its decision was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| because of changing conditions adjacent to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4081)|

| 1:08:07| If this body disagreed with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| as a change in condition that qualifies for rezoning this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| Yeah, it's really up to this body to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| whether the conditions that are required to be met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| in order for a zoning change are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| You're not bound by what the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| You're not bound by what the Planning Commission finds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| nor are you bound by what the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| staff recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| You are to look at it with your own eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| and determine whether the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| as set out in the code are sufficiently met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| so that you feel comfortable in voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| either for or against it, as the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| Okay, so you're not bound by the previous decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| Okay, so the explicit specific change in condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| of the self-storage unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| we're not limited to that criteria, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| And I watched the Planning Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| and this is, I think, a reasonable use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| However, I think consistency-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| it doesn't meet the criteria of the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| as far as I can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| I do think people should be able to build on their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| whatever their zoning allows for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| However, when this body has to consider rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| we have to consider what could happen on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| after this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| And so while I definitely support an office on top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| adjacent office to an existing dental office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| I have concern about ignoring the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| for future development on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| So I have a bit of concern at this moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| about what could happen if we rezone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| if that opportunity falls through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| or if something happens afterwards, so that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4194)|

| 1:10:14| No, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| Okay, motion on the floor is to deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| so a yes vote is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| All those in favor, please say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4221)|

| 1:10:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4231)|

| 1:10:41| because it's not possible to change the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| without changing the underlying plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| Next two items are moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210907?start=4246)|
