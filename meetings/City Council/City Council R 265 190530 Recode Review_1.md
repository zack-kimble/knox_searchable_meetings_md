| 2:33:20| a permitted in the commercial, the CG, CH, or CR, rather than that special use in the CH?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9200)|
| 2:33:28| Is that what you said, Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9208)|
| 2:33:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9210)|
| 2:33:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9211)|
| 2:33:32| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9212)|
| 2:33:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9213)|
| 2:33:34| So, to some neighborhoods, office is a buffer zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9214)|
| 2:33:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9217)|
| 2:33:38| But in my neighborhood, with an S on the end of it, CG is our buffer zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9218)|
| 2:33:43| We don't have a buffer zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9223)|
| 2:33:44| We have no such thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9224)|
| 2:33:46| So, when we start saying, well, let's put it not in O for somebody's neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9226)|
| 2:33:51| but we could put it in CG because that's not a buffer zone, it is our buffer zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9231)|
| 2:33:55| And I will say, from experience, you know, one of the problems with some of these facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9235)|
| 2:34:04| is that they're not regulated, they're not accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9244)|
| 2:34:07| I know Councilwoman Singh-Perez and I've had that conversation regarding, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9247)|
| 2:34:11| the meetings that existed last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9251)|
| 2:34:16| It's all across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9256)|
| 2:34:18| There's well-intended people, but there's no regulation because there's anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9258)|
| 2:34:21| any of us could decide we're going to do one of these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9261)|
| 2:34:25| And what's happened in my neighborhood is we had somebody who was running a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9265)|
| 2:34:29| with five residents and no accountability whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9269)|
| 2:34:32| and they broke into people's homes in the middle of the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9272)|
| 2:34:37| and actually didn't steal things, they did very strange things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9277)|
| 2:34:42| went through their doors, we'll put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9282)|
| 2:34:46| And then they decided they were doing such an awesome job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9286)|
| 2:34:49| that they decided they'd do a facility with 40 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9289)|
| 2:34:53| And that was the problem for our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9293)|
| 2:34:55| is like you were doing a terrible job with five beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9295)|
| 2:34:57| now you're going to grow to 40 beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9297)|
| 2:35:00| and there's no accountability and there's no regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9300)|
| 2:35:03| So that's where my neighborhoods get apprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9303)|
| 2:35:06| is because we've been the neighborhoods where the real estate was so cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9306)|
| 2:35:11| But you're talking about in C-S-G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| Yes, and I'm just saying if you start saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9313)|
| 2:35:16| well, we've got to put it in a commercial zone, let's put it in C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9316)|
| 2:35:18| that ends up being my buffer zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9318)|
| 2:35:20| and I will say C-H ends up being the buffer zone for, you know, other neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9320)|
| 2:35:25| So, you know, we don't live in an idealistic world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9325)|
| 2:35:29| where everybody gets a buffer strip between their residential areas and their certain types of-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9329)|
| 2:35:34| You're suggesting neither one of these three you think would be appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| If we're talking permanent versus special use, you know, I just have some apprehension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9337)|
| 2:35:44| And I speak from the place of I have three group homes on my block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9344)|
| 2:35:48| and I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9348)|
| 2:35:51| I just, I know, I understand people's concerns because we've lived through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9351)|
| 2:35:56| And it really boils down to the lack of accountability, regulation, and structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9356)|
| 2:36:03| And so, and that's not the city's place to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9363)|
| 2:36:09| And those are valid concerns, and I think we all share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9369)|
| 2:36:12| These are buffer zones for all of us representing our neighborhoods and our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9372)|
| 2:36:17| And so the flip side of that is a lot of these people will transition back in with a family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9377)|
| 2:36:24| That does not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9384)|
| 2:36:25| They end up on the streets, and then we are going to still have that recidivism with crime and reincarceration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9385)|
| 2:36:33| So, again, if that looks like maybe the C-H is the permitted use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9393)|
| 2:36:38| and we look at special use in another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9398)|
| 2:36:45| this is why I appreciate the dialogue and the feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| because I do think that this is an opportunity for us to make some progress as it relates to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9407)|
| 2:36:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9415)|
| 2:36:56| Councilwoman Sincrest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9416)|
| 2:36:57| I'm very comfortable with permitted use, you know, for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9417)|
| 2:37:02| NPC to see is it a buffer zone or not, or, you know, where it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9422)|
| 2:37:06| I think that's absolutely fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9426)|
| 2:37:08| And as this is a living document, as rules change with licensing and accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9428)|
| 2:37:16| we can make some changes to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9436)|
| 2:37:18| So you're comfortable with which?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9438)|
| 2:37:21| Permitted uses for halfway houses, permitted uses from C-G down to C-R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9441)|
| 2:37:31| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9451)|
| 2:37:32| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9452)|
| 2:37:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9453)|
| 2:37:34| So you're saying have those for permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9454)|
| 2:37:35| Councilwoman Ryder is saying have them not permitted, have them special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9455)|
| 2:37:41| I just want to understand the various opinions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9461)|
| 2:37:43| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9463)|
| 2:37:44| I'm saying it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9464)|
| 2:37:45| I mean special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9465)|
| 2:37:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9466)|
| 2:37:47| You're suggesting special use for the C-G, C-H, and C-R,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| so they would have to be reviewed, go through review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9470)|
| 2:37:57| Councilwoman, do anyone else want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9477)|
| 2:38:02| Or would we be more comfortable with C-H being permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9482)|
| 2:38:07| and then maybe C-R being special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9487)|
| 2:38:11| and then we come back at a later date and reevaluate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9491)|
| 2:38:14| Just as a note, in terms of intensity of the zone and the bills from C-G to C-H to C-R,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9494)|
| 2:38:23| C-R is typically a much more intense zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9503)|
| 2:38:29| There are two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9509)|
| 2:38:33| One is positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9513)|
| 2:38:34| It's typically more separated from residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9514)|
| 2:38:37| The other is because it's a more intense district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9517)|
| 2:38:40| it's more intensely developed with commercial or non-residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9520)|
| 2:38:44| Even as a permitted, looking at it one way, building up as a special use in C-G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9524)|
| 2:38:50| special use in C-R, or C-H and maybe a permitted use in C-R,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9530)|
| 2:38:55| sounds good if you want separation from the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9535)|
| 2:38:58| but then you're putting this facility as a permitted use in a district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9538)|
| 2:39:02| where it's more intensely developed with non-residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| which may be a disadvantage to the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9545)|
| 2:39:08| I'm sorry to further muddy the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9548)|
| 2:39:11| but just to give you a feel of what we've gone through for a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9551)|
| 2:39:17| trying to identify locations for pretty much all these uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9557)|
| 2:39:23| Where are they appropriate in what context?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9563)|
| 2:39:26| So you're saying in C-R it would be a disservice to the halfway house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9566)|
| 2:39:31| It depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9571)|
| 2:39:34| There are some places in C-R where it may be a great addition to that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9574)|
| 2:39:41| and have uses and places of employment where the residents could walk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9581)|
| 2:39:47| and it could be a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9587)|
| 2:39:50| In another C-R, maybe next to the roadway that services the boat rental place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9590)|
| 2:40:00| It's just challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9600)|
| 2:40:07| I'm just trying to provide some direction, but again, as a living document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9607)|
| 2:40:12| it may be special use in C-G, C-H and a permitted use in C-R| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9612)|
| 2:40:18| and we can look and see if that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9618)|
| 2:40:21| And if it doesn't, we can come back again and adjust it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| Is permitted use in an office too far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9625)|
| 2:40:30| Is special use in an office too far for a halfway house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9630)|
| 2:40:36| Is that going too far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| No matter what answer I give, I'm going to make somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| It's going to be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9641)|
| 2:40:44| Well, there's a lot of offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9644)|
| 2:40:46| There are houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9646)|
| 2:40:47| I mean, there's just a lot of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9647)|
| 2:40:49| I would be, I think, more comfortable as a special use in the office district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9649)|
| 2:40:53| I think because of its nature, it was a smaller scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9653)|
| 2:40:56| and it's a special use in the office in C-G and maybe even C-H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9656)|
| 2:41:02| but as the zone intensity increases, allow it as a permitted use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9662)|
| 2:41:06| and see if there's any desire to locate in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9666)|
| 2:41:10| Where are they permitted now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9670)|
| 2:41:14| I'm going to let Peter answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9674)|
| 2:41:16| I know typically they're used on review in the districts in which they're permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9676)|
| 2:41:23| so they currently go through a review process with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9683)|
| 2:41:27| That is a public review and public notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9687)|
| 2:41:33| I don't think they're well defined now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9693)|
| 2:41:36| We had an issue with the definition of the Owen Ross McNabb Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9696)|
| 2:41:40| that's out off Western Avenue, how to define that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9700)|
| 2:41:44| because our current code doesn't clearly define halfway homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9704)|
| 2:41:50| I make a motion that we, for a halfway house, special use in C-G and O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9710)|
| 2:42:01| And what about C-H and the others you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9721)|
| 2:42:05| It's already in C-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9725)|
| 2:42:07| Right, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9727)|
| 2:42:08| It's already in C-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9728)|
| 2:42:09| C-G and O, just make a motion and debate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9729)|
| 2:42:13| Motion for special use in C-G and an O office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9733)|
| 2:42:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9739)|
| 2:42:21| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9741)|
| 2:42:24| Can I make an amended motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9744)|
| 2:42:27| Can I provide a little bit of context?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| Sure, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9749)|
| 2:42:30| I did a quick search of our current ordinance for halfway houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9750)|
| 2:42:35| and these are the districts in which they are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9755)|
| 2:42:38| O-2, civic and institutional district, O-1, C-4, C-3, C-2, C-6, and R-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9758)|
| 2:42:51| with various levels of oversight, whether they're a use on review or use by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9771)|
| 2:42:58| Those are the districts that they're permitted in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9778)|
| 2:43:00| As of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9780)|
| 2:43:01| Today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9781)|
| 2:43:02| O-2, O-1, C-4, C-3, C-2, C-6, and R-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9782)|
| 2:43:07| So what we're doing with recode is we are restricting them down from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9787)|
| 2:43:22| I'm going to make an amended motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| I'm making a motion to add halfway house by special use to, I'm adding C-N because if it was in R-2, C-G, C-H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9804)|
| 2:43:38| permitted in C-R, and special use in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9818)|
| 2:43:53| First off, I don't think we have that many C-Ns for one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9833)|
| 2:43:56| and I'm not familiar with where they are and what they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| so I'm not comfortable at this moment with C-N being so blind as to what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9839)|
| 2:44:09| I'm not saying a definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9849)|
| 2:44:13| The one that comes to mind most readily is Persona Taco on Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9853)|
| 2:44:21| That area is C-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| Actually, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9863)|
| 2:44:27| Sequoia Hills is C-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| The commercial district in Sequoia Hills is C-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| My house is C-N, where I live is C-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9872)|
| 2:44:42| I'm pretty sure there's a halfway house for women coming out of incarceration in the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9882)|
| 2:44:53| which I think you're probably R-2 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9893)|
| 2:45:02| I just want to make some allowance for that it was allowed in R-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9902)|
| 2:45:09| If it has been allowed in R-2, that's what I'm trying to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9909)|
| 2:45:14| That's why I was stretching it into neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9914)|
| 2:45:18| and if it is areas like right on the edge of neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9918)|
| 2:45:21| that might be a good place for the neighborhood and for the person trying to rehabilitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9921)|
| 2:45:31| Gerald, excuse me for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9931)|
| 2:45:35| Yes, Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9935)|
| 2:45:38| Gerald, so existing halfway houses, and we don't know how many there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9938)|
| 2:45:43| and who's running them at the moment, would they be grandfathered in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9943)|
| 2:45:47| They would be grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9947)|
| 2:45:48| If they've been permitted, then they would be grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9948)|
| 2:45:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9953)|
| 2:45:57| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9957)|
| 2:45:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9958)|
| 2:46:03| I think this is a really good discussion about the halfway house, and I'm glad we're having it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9963)|
| 2:46:11| I don't think we've had enough time to really look at where these different districts are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9971)|
| 2:46:18| because the map could change, and that might change what we're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9978)|
| 2:46:23| So what I was going to recommend is that we ask Gerald to come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9983)|
| 2:46:30| with where halfway houses are now and how that would translate into recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9990)|
| 2:46:40| so that we can kind of have a better picture of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10000)|
| 2:46:45| I'm just not comfortable voting on it at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10005)|
| 2:46:48| because we may be talking about areas where I may have neighborhoods that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10008)|
| 2:46:55| hey, that's just what we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10015)|
| 2:46:57| Hey, that's where I live, and that's next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10017)|
| 2:47:01| Well, some of their children may have gone to jail and need a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10021)|
| 2:47:04| And I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| I think we should have this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10026)|
| 2:47:07| I think it's a good discussion to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| I guess I'm not ready to vote on that right this second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10029)|
| 2:47:14| because we're not really sure where we're going to be talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10034)|
| 2:47:19| So this could be something that in this interim period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| that we bring back some recommendations that have some conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10042)|
| 2:47:26| about where the existing ones are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10046)|
| 2:47:28| knowing the range that we've had here in the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10048)|
| 2:47:34| and then put this off to a future meeting to come back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10054)|
| 2:47:38| Is that something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10058)|
| 2:47:39| That's basically what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| So you pull back your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10060)|
| 2:47:44| Oh, I rescind my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| And yours, Steve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10068)|
| 2:47:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10069)|
| 2:47:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10070)|
| 2:47:51| I just want to give a little background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10071)|
| 2:47:55| So past, in the existing code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10075)|
| 2:48:00| and I can't tell you off the top of my head which part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10080)|
| 2:48:03| but there was an attempt in the past to address concentration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10083)|
| 2:48:09| And that is because, again, being from one of the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| that was deemed not desirable at one point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10091)|
| 2:48:16| full city blocks were purchased and converted to halfway houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10096)|
| 2:48:20| So we had large concentrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10100)|
| 2:48:22| And that is where some of the problems came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10102)|
| 2:48:27| is that you have large concentrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10107)|
| 2:48:29| You turn entire city blocks, you change the character of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10109)|
| 2:48:32| And it's not an integration process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10112)|
| 2:48:36| which I know is part of the healing and rehabilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10116)|
| 2:48:40| And it caused various problems within the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10120)|
| 2:48:44| And so there was an attempt in the past to talk about concentration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10124)|
| 2:48:49| and distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| And what happened was that the way it's defined in the current code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10131)|
| 2:48:54| is halfway houses that were on the state list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10134)|
| 2:48:58| And so what happened was when we had this come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10138)|
| 2:49:00| where the one halfway house went from five beds to 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10140)|
| 2:49:03| they all went off the state list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10143)|
| 2:49:06| So nobody met the definition anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10146)|
| 2:49:09| because the definition said if you're on this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10149)|
| 2:49:13| And so then they were like, okay, everybody off the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10153)|
| 2:49:16| And if you want to come back on the list, you come back on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10156)|
| 2:49:18| But if you don't, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10158)|
| 2:49:19| Oh, nobody's on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10159)|
| 2:49:20| Nobody meets the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10160)|
| 2:49:22| So now we can turn entire areas into, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10162)|
| 2:49:28| eight structures in a row become halfway houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10168)|
| 2:49:31| And I don't think that's healthy for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| And that's not the desired goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10173)|
| 2:49:36| The desired goal is integration, is mixed neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10176)|
| 2:49:41| because that's what you're striving for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10181)|
| 2:49:43| So I'm not making a comment one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10183)|
| 2:49:46| I just want you guys to know what's in the existing code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10186)|
| 2:49:48| why it's in the existing code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10188)|
| 2:49:50| and it's because of specific examples in the Central and Broadway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10190)|
| 2:49:55| So just keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| And when you go search our existing code, that's there for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10197)|
| 2:50:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10203)|
| 2:50:04| So, by the way, we are trying to get this air adjusted in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10204)|
| 2:50:08| That's what I'm texting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10208)|
| 2:50:09| Everyone's freezing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10209)|
| 2:50:10| Y'all were smart enough to bring a blanket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10210)|
| 2:50:14| So I might have to go get one out in my car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10214)|
| 2:50:17| We're going to have to share that blanket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10217)|
| 2:50:19| Yeah, you're going to have to share it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10219)|
| 2:50:21| Or you could auction it off probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| So I was just texting, trying to get to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10223)|
| 2:50:26| I know our staff has been trying to get to them as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10226)|
| 2:50:28| so we're trying to get this adjusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10228)|
| 2:50:30| Mr. Roach, did you want to speak to this issue of halfway houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10233)|
| 2:50:34| Just as an example for what we're dealing with here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10234)|
| 2:50:36| there used to be the Midway Rehab Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10236)|
| 2:50:39| It was located right at Fifth Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10239)|
| 2:50:42| and then further out across from Pellissippi State,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10242)|
| 2:50:45| where Pellissippi State is located on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10245)|
| 2:50:48| I worked there for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| So it's, I guess, a mixed area, a residential zoned area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10250)|
| 2:50:58| And none of this – we never heard any of this come up in terms of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10258)|
| 2:51:04| I'm disturbed kind of by the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10264)|
| 2:51:07| Lauren's saying something about the state having a list of halfway houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10267)|
| 2:51:14| But they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10274)|
| 2:51:15| Well, it's not mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10275)|
| 2:51:17| They're not regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10277)|
| 2:51:18| And how in the past did you know that there were halfway houses located wherever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10278)|
| 2:51:25| I've had a halfway house located just above where I grew up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10285)|
| 2:51:31| and it treated – it housed different types of people in different situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10291)|
| 2:51:36| some drug situations, rehab situations, some disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10296)|
| 2:51:41| But it was designated as a halfway house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10301)|
| 2:51:45| So who in the past has had purview over these structures, buildings, businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10305)|
| 2:51:59| I find that kind of odd that that wouldn't already be – there wouldn't be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10319)|
| 2:52:06| Obviously, you guys had to have some information in order to know what you were dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10326)|
| 2:52:13| And as far as the institutions, Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10333)|
| 2:52:17| they recommend and coordinate with certain people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10337)|
| 2:52:23| residence owners or whoever wants to establish a halfway house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10343)|
| 2:52:27| to send the people that come through their programs when they are in need of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10347)|
| 2:52:31| I do know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| So maybe you might want to refer back to them, Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10353)|
| 2:52:38| or any other service provider to get that type of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10358)|
| 2:52:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10362)|
| 2:52:43| Rick, what's your address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10363)|
| 2:52:45| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10365)|
| 2:52:47| 2404 Victoria, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10367)|
| 2:52:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10370)|
| 2:52:52| Mr. Dalvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10372)|
| 2:52:53| Yeah, I don't want to talk about halfway houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10373)|
| 2:52:56| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10376)|
| 2:52:57| We're still on the table, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10377)|
| 2:53:00| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10380)|
| 2:53:01| We're still on this table, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10381)|
| 2:53:02| Yes, but hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10382)|
| 2:53:03| Is there any more discussion on halfway houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10383)|
| 2:53:05| So we're going to continue to visit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10385)|
| 2:53:08| We're going to dig into it, and staff will bring back some recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10388)|
| 2:53:13| If you have other thoughts about it, please reach out to Gerald so we can do this, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10393)|
| 2:53:20| Are we – I'm sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10400)|
| 2:53:23| If we're going to give staff recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10403)|
| 2:53:25| are we happy with the current setup in the current code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10405)|
| 2:53:29| or do we want to adjust it one way or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| What I was hearing was that we didn't want to be more restrictive than we are currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10411)|
| 2:53:37| And part of the study we need, I think, is for you to tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10417)|
| 2:53:41| because the zones have been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10421)|
| 2:53:44| So we might go from seven to four, but it actually might be more places and not less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10424)|
| 2:53:48| Are we looking to get an equivalency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10428)|
| 2:53:50| I think letting us know what the equivalency would be is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10430)|
| 2:53:54| We'll start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10434)|
| 2:53:56| Good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10436)|
| 2:53:57| Thanks, Peter, for asking for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10437)|
| 2:54:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10440)|
| 2:54:02| Mr. Delvopi, just for the record, you are standing between us and pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10442)|
| 2:54:08| I don't want to put any pressure on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10448)|
| 2:54:09| A ten-second wonder, Nick Delvopi, Crestwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10449)|
| 2:54:12| On page 9.2, I think this is more cosmetic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10452)|
| 2:54:16| it seems to me it says that domestic violence is allowed in all the residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10456)|
| 2:54:21| I bet that's shelters or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10461)|
| 2:54:23| Could we put a word in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10463)|
| 2:54:25| It's probably happening, but we shouldn't encourage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10465)|
| 2:54:29| If you look at 9.3, that's the rest of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10469)|
| 2:54:32| Actually, look on the next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10472)|
| 2:54:36| The line went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10476)|
| 2:54:39| The next line is on the next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10479)|
| 2:54:41| But excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10481)|
| 2:54:43| As you did when you were a councilman, you looked at every line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10483)|
| 2:54:47| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10487)|
| 2:54:48| Except the next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10488)|
| 2:54:49| But, yeah, we actually had that joke in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10489)|
| 2:54:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10492)|
| 2:54:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10493)|
| 2:54:54| Anything else on the use matrix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| I didn't even know we barely got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10496)|
| 2:55:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10501)|
| 2:55:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10502)|
| 2:55:03| So there's more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10503)|
| 2:55:04| Here's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10504)|
| 2:55:05| How about if we break for pizza, and then we will come back and see what else there is on the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10505)|
| 2:55:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10512)|
| 2:55:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10513)|
| 2:55:14| So how long do you all want to break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10514)|
| 2:55:17| Twenty-five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10517)|
| 2:55:22| Actually, it's 6.08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10522)|
| 2:55:23| How about 6.30 we come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10523)|
| 2:55:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10525)|
| 2:55:26| Twenty-two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10526)|
| 2:55:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10527)|
| 2:55:28| If we can get everyone back in the room, we will start in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10528)|
| 2:55:42| Now that it's warmer and we've all eaten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10542)|
| 2:55:44| Can we turn on the air?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10544)|
| 2:55:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10545)|
| 2:55:46| We might have to turn the air back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10546)|
| 2:55:52| We'll bring the coffee out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10552)|
| 2:55:53| Do we have coffee here, Will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10555)|
| 2:55:56| Coffee and tea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10556)|
| 2:55:57| Where's the coffee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10557)|
| 2:55:58| Over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10558)|
| 2:55:59| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10559)|
| 2:56:01| I think people came just for the pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10561)|
| 2:56:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10574)|
| 2:56:15| We'll notice who left after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10575)|
| 2:56:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10589)|
| 2:56:30| We will call the meeting back to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10590)|
| 2:56:33| Thank you for the pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10593)|
| 2:56:36| Council and the Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10596)|
| 2:56:40| It was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10600)|
| 2:56:43| I think it was just the right amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10603)|
| 2:56:44| I think there was just a few more pieces, although some people are still out there, so they may be eating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10604)|
| 2:56:50| Also, there is coffee to my left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10610)|
| 2:56:54| If somebody wants some coffee, come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| We'll just keep serving until it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10616)|
| 2:57:01| Actually, we'll go back and try to find some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10621)|
| 2:57:05| End of the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10625)|
| 2:57:10| Actually, I think I have some of those little ones up in my office, so we'll run up and get them if we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10630)|
| 2:57:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10637)|
| 2:57:18| Budget amendment for coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10638)|
| 2:57:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10643)|
| 2:57:24| So we're going to – there's some more items in the use matrix in order to complete Article 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10644)|
| 2:57:34| And what I'm going to suggest as we get into each of these is if we get really intense into any one topic on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10654)|
| 2:57:42| or as we move forward, the sooner we recognize that we need more work to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10662)|
| 2:57:48| and then we can send it with suggestions to staff, then the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10668)|
| 2:57:52| Because if we can get through all of these, then during the six weeks or so before we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10672)|
| 2:57:59| maybe seven weeks, I haven't counted – before we meet again at the earliest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10679)|
| 2:58:04| then we can get a lot of – we can make a lot of progress, I hope, on those issues that might still be sticklers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10684)|
| 2:58:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10691)|
| 2:58:12| So we are still on Article 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10692)|
| 2:58:15| We're on page – well, I don't know what page you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| I'm going to call on Councilman Ryder because she's got a few she wants to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10697)|
| 2:58:23| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10703)|
| 2:58:24| 9-2 is the beginning of the matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10704)|
| 2:58:27| 9-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10707)|
| 2:58:29| Actually, if we will turn to alphabetically, 9-4, matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10709)|
| 2:58:41| Everybody's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10721)|
| 2:58:42| That needs to be here, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10722)|
| 2:58:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10723)|
| 2:58:44| Gerald, so kennel is a special use in CG, and I've had some feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10724)|
| 2:58:50| So CG is the new C-3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10730)|
| 2:58:53| I don't want to belabor kennels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| Basically, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10735)|
| 2:58:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10736)|
| 2:58:57| So historically, we only allowed kennels in C-4, which is the equivalent of C-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10737)|
| 2:59:05| So is there –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10745)|
| 2:59:07| Where is kennels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10749)|
| 2:59:10| 9-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10750)|
| 2:59:11| On page 9-4 of the matrix –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| There, the kennel with a K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| Kennel with a K for dogs and cats both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10755)|
| 2:59:18| Only dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10758)|
| 2:59:19| Only dogs to be kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10759)|
| 2:59:21| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10761)|
| 2:59:22| We didn't include the cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10762)|
| 2:59:24| No pigs or fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10764)|
| 2:59:27| Can we strike as a special use kennel in CG unless we've had requests that would be rational for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10767)|
| 2:59:34| We've had no requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10774)|
| 2:59:35| We tried to – this is a kennel, as you can see, is a new addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10775)|
| 2:59:40| and just tried to think through this and say if I lived in Forth and Gillen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10780)|
| 2:59:47| and wanted a place to board my dog for the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10787)|
| 2:59:50| it would be nice to be able to walk my dog to the kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10790)|
| 2:59:54| And especially as a special use, it comes before the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10794)|
| 2:59:57| but if council desires to delete it, I'm fine with that since I don't live in Forth and Gillen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10797)|
| 3:00:06| It's not that we wouldn't have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10806)|
| 3:00:10| We just haven't found a place for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10810)|
| 3:00:12| It's more bikeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10812)|
| 3:00:15| But then I'd have to leave my job because I said when I could bike to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10815)|
| 3:00:20| I know my mission here had been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10820)|
| 3:00:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10824)|
| 3:00:25| Well, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10825)|
| 3:00:26| It's not completed until the code is passed, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10826)|
| 3:00:30| Just for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10830)|
| 3:00:32| So I think the concern is that kennels typically include outdoor facilities with dog runs and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10832)|
| 3:00:40| If that's council's direction, I'm very comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10840)|
| 3:00:44| So is there a motion on that or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10844)|
| 3:00:48| I'd like to make a motion that we exclude or strike the S in the CG under kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10848)|
| 3:00:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10857)|
| 3:00:58| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| Anybody to talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10860)|
| 3:01:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10862)|
| 3:01:03| So the motion is to strike removes a special use for kennels in CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10863)|
| 3:01:11| And I just was going to say, and we did have that instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| There was one around the corner, and there was lots of complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10873)|
| 3:01:17| because it backed up to the residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| So I think in the future, if it comes up, if somebody were to request it, I think it could be a discussion point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10879)|
| 3:01:24| But there might have to be some buffer discussion for residential because that has been a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10884)|
| 3:01:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10892)|
| 3:01:33| Y'all ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10893)|
| 3:01:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10894)|
| 3:01:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10895)|
| 3:01:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10898)|
| 3:01:39| Passes eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10899)|
| 3:01:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10906)|
| 3:01:47| Who voted no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10909)|
| 3:01:50| Who voted no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10910)|
| 3:01:51| Seema.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10911)|
| 3:01:52| Councilwoman Sincerez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10912)|
| 3:01:53| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10913)|
| 3:01:54| I'm sure I didn't vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10914)|
| 3:01:55| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10915)|
| 3:01:56| I'm sure I didn't vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10916)|
| 3:01:57| I did not mark you as no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10917)|
| 3:02:00| Would you like to be marked as no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10920)|
| 3:02:02| No, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10922)|
| 3:02:03| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10923)|
| 3:02:04| Just wanted to make sure we weren't mistakenly allocating your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10924)|
| 3:02:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10928)|
| 3:02:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10929)|
| 3:02:10| So that passed eight to one to remove the kennel S from CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10930)|
| 3:02:15| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10935)|
| 3:02:16| Oh, I didn't push my button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10936)|
| 3:02:18| You just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10938)|
| 3:02:19| I don't see any other lights on, and I know you have some, so go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10939)|
| 3:02:23| Oh, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10943)|
| 3:02:26| You're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10946)|
| 3:02:28| This has come up several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10948)|
| 3:02:30| Office park, eating and drinking establishment, personal service establishment, which are on various pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10950)|
| 3:02:40| and retail goods establishment are all not principal uses in this OP, their accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10960)|
| 3:02:49| So the use matrix is really set up to make this easier for people to figure out what they can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10969)|
| 3:02:56| And I know we've talked about this before, but when you have the P there on each of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10976)|
| 3:03:03| which if you go back to five one, you can see what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10983)|
| 3:03:08| Page five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10988)|
| 3:03:09| Yeah, page five one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| That's where it talks about these as accessory, not principal uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10991)|
| 3:03:15| So I think that the use matrix is one of the highlights of RECO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=10995)|
| 3:03:21| It's making things easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11001)|
| 3:03:24| If you're trying to figure out what's going on and you think I've got this office park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11004)|
| 3:03:29| and I'm going to do retail goods establishment, it's, oh, it's permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11009)|
| 3:03:33| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11013)|
| 3:03:34| If you don't go back to five one, you don't realize that it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11014)|
| 3:03:36| It's an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11016)|
| 3:03:38| So I think before I had mentioned why don't we change that to an A for accessory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11018)|
| 3:03:41| and maybe that's too complicated, but we need to do something here so it's not we're not making things muddier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11021)|
| 3:03:49| for people to try to figure out what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11029)|
| 3:03:51| And I'm trying to remember back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11031)|
| 3:03:53| I believe in one of the earlier drafts we had it noted with basically a footnote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11033)|
| 3:04:00| There was a one beside that P, and then at the bottom of the page it said permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11040)|
| 3:04:05| Is it an accessory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11045)|
| 3:04:07| I mean, I think we did something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11047)|
| 3:04:09| We debated that, and then if you look at 9.2G, it says certain uses are prohibited as stand-alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11049)|
| 3:04:15| and we decided to go with that approach, but I think we, and that's on page 9.1, 9.2G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11055)|
| 3:04:23| but I think leaving that statement in and having a footnote for each of those uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11063)|
| 3:04:28| may be the appropriate way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11068)|
| 3:04:31| Maybe it's a P with an asterisk, and then below it an asterisk says this is not a principal use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11071)|
| 3:04:36| but an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11076)|
| 3:04:38| Prohibited as a stand-alone use must be accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11078)|
| 3:04:44| That was, you know, and I guess we don't want to go to the point of putting an A for accessory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11084)|
| 3:04:50| because then you're going to have a whole new chart, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11090)|
| 3:04:53| I think that's an easy way to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11093)|
| 3:04:55| I hope that would address the concern about people being confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11095)|
| 3:05:01| I think that would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| Do you, are there other instances where we would need to use that same asterisk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11103)|
| 3:05:08| That's the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11108)|
| 3:05:09| That's the only one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11109)|
| 3:05:10| That's the only one I had seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11110)|
| 3:05:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11111)|
| 3:05:12| So my motion would be that under office park, the OP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11112)|
| 3:05:21| in the sections for eating and drinking establishment, personal service establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11121)|
| 3:05:26| retail goods establishment are all indicated with a P with an asterisk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11126)|
| 3:05:32| and at the bottom of each page the P with the asterisk is defined as these are accessory uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11132)|
| 3:05:41| not principal uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11141)|
| 3:05:46| That's your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11146)|
| 3:05:47| That would be the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11147)|
| 3:05:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11148)|
| 3:05:49| Christina, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11149)|
| 3:05:50| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11150)|
| 3:05:51| Could you repeat your motion, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11151)|
| 3:05:54| Well, if I remember what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11154)|
| 3:05:55| Just on the eating and drinking, personal service, and what was the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11155)|
| 3:06:00| Yeah, so if you go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11160)|
| 3:06:02| Retail goods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11162)|
| 3:06:03| Yeah, if you just look at an OP and you go to eating and drinking establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11163)|
| 3:06:07| that would get the asterisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11167)|
| 3:06:09| Then you go to personal service establishment, that would get the asterisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11169)|
| 3:06:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11172)|
| 3:06:13| Then you go to retail goods establishment, that would get the asterisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11173)|
| 3:06:16| And then at the bottom of each of those pages where they appear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11176)|
| 3:06:19| you would have, you know, P with the asterisk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11179)|
| 3:06:25| this indicates an accessory use, not a principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11185)|
| 3:06:31| And I think it may be clear because these are prohibited as a stand-alone use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11191)|
| 3:06:37| and maybe put that instead of as an accessory use because, again, thinking of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11197)|
| 3:06:44| although it's not a good example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11204)|
| 3:06:47| Aubrey's and the office park out at North Shore and. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11207)|
| 3:06:53| Fruitvale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11213)|
| 3:06:54| Fruitvale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11214)|
| 3:06:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11215)|
| 3:06:56| Paper mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11216)|
| 3:06:57| It's not accessory to any business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11217)|
| 3:07:02| It could be a principal use, but it's prohibited as a stand-alone building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11222)|
| 3:07:07| I think that's more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11227)|
| 3:07:09| So you would suggest a different. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11229)|
| 3:07:11| Yeah, a different wording that they're. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| At the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11233)|
| 3:07:15| Prohibited as a stand-alone building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11235)|
| 3:07:19| And I think that's in keeping with the intent of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11239)|
| 3:07:24| So as a stand-alone building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11244)|
| 3:07:26| I could see that, but we'll see what the audience has to tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11246)|
| 3:07:32| The audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11252)|
| 3:07:34| We'll now hear from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11254)|
| 3:07:35| Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11255)|
| 3:07:38| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11258)|
| 3:07:39| As the audience says, Carleen Malone, here's the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11259)|
| 3:07:47| and let me make this very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11267)|
| 3:07:50| We are not trying to keep eating and drinking establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11270)|
| 3:07:56| retail good establishments, personal service establishments out of the OP zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11276)|
| 3:08:02| when serving other businesses that are there as accessory uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11282)|
| 3:08:05| Here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11285)|
| 3:08:08| If you try to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11288)|
| 3:08:09| If you look at the language, everything related to OP zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11289)|
| 3:08:15| and these three uses says they are accessory services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11295)|
| 3:08:21| Accessory services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11301)|
| 3:08:23| If you look at the definition of. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11303)|
| 3:08:25| This is what we need to get straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11305)|
| 3:08:27| The matrix says it's only for principal and temporary uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11307)|
| 3:08:32| The principal uses are permitted and special, and the temporary uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11312)|
| 3:08:40| It does not address accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11320)|
| 3:08:42| Here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11322)|
| 3:08:43| The definition of principal use is the main use of land or structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11323)|
| 3:08:48| as distinguished from an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11328)|
| 3:08:52| So you can't kind of sort of be both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11332)|
| 3:08:55| They're like distinguished from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11335)|
| 3:08:58| They're not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11338)|
| 3:09:00| So here's the problem if you just say they're principal uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11340)|
| 3:09:04| but have to be in the same building with other principal uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11344)|
| 3:09:09| You've just defined Westtown Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11349)|
| 3:09:12| That's not an office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11352)|
| 3:09:14| So I think we need to figure out. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11354)|
| 3:09:18| I mean, if somebody went to Mr. Ahrens and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11358)|
| 3:09:20| I want a permit to open an eating and drinking establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11360)|
| 3:09:24| it'll be in. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11364)|
| 3:09:26| It won't be a separate building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11366)|
| 3:09:28| but there's no other use there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11368)|
| 3:09:31| are you going to give them a permit if they're a principal use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11371)|
| 3:09:35| And if I come in and say, but it says it's an accessory service. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11375)|
| 3:09:39| These are the kinds of, the very kinds of disputes we don't want to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11379)|
| 3:09:45| So I think we have to be. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11385)|
| 3:09:47| I think they should be accessory uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11387)|
| 3:09:49| and I think they should be in the same building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11389)|
| 3:09:52| That allows them to exist without any special permissions or anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11392)|
| 3:09:57| but they're clearly there to serve the main, the principal use of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11397)|
| 3:10:02| which should be the principal uses of Office Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11402)|
| 3:10:06| So I think you're either going to have to get rid of the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11406)|
| 3:10:11| that says they're accessory services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11411)|
| 3:10:15| but you can't call them a principal use and an accessory service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11415)|
| 3:10:18| because that just is self-contradictory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11418)|
| 3:10:26| Here's Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11426)|
| 3:10:28| What do you think about changing on page 5-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11428)|
| 3:10:32| instead of calling it an accessory service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11432)|
| 3:10:35| it's a service accessory to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11435)|
| 3:10:40| Is that the distinction we're looking to try and create?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11440)|
| 3:10:44| I don't know what that distinction is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11444)|
| 3:10:46| I mean, I guess I would have to take time to think about the change in wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11446)|
| 3:10:50| I'm just saying if principal and accessory are distinguished from each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11450)|
| 3:10:55| we need to decide what these uses are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11455)|
| 3:10:57| What about supplementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11457)|
| 3:11:01| Well, what's the definition of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11461)|
| 3:11:04| I don't have it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11464)|
| 3:11:05| I mean, I think what we're getting at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11465)|
| 3:11:07| it's very similar language to our current industrial zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11467)|
| 3:11:10| where retail and services need to be accessory to the industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11470)|
| 3:11:18| Let me pull up the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11478)|
| 3:11:19| Yeah, but they're not considered principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11479)|
| 3:11:21| They're not listed in a chart as a principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11481)|
| 3:11:25| There's no chart in our existing ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11485)|
| 3:11:28| Maybe that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11488)|
| 3:11:31| According with it, it's very bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11491)|
| 3:11:34| In I-2, it says a retail or service use only when it directly serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11494)|
| 3:11:39| or is auxiliary to the needs of industrial plants or employees thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11499)|
| 3:11:45| I'm assuming we're trying to get something of similar language in the OP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11505)|
| 3:11:50| Yeah, and again, I don't know how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11510)|
| 3:11:53| I just don't think you can list it as a principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11513)|
| 3:11:57| We have no problem with the language that says they're accessory services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11517)|
| 3:12:02| These things are accessory services in an office park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11522)|
| 3:12:05| which is similar to what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11525)|
| 3:12:07| The problem comes in when you then list it as a principal use on the matrix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11527)|
| 3:12:12| because then that does not match the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11532)|
| 3:12:15| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11535)|
| 3:12:16| Right, and that's why I think we talked about making the change with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11536)|
| 3:12:22| it's too difficult to make an A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11542)|
| 3:12:25| so we can make a P with an asterisk and then define what that is below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11545)|
| 3:12:30| And I think the question is what the asterisk definition at the bottom was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11550)|
| 3:12:37| And, Gerald, you had said that you're not a freestanding structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11557)|
| 3:12:41| I'd be happy to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11561)|
| 3:12:43| Okay, this must be accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11563)|
| 3:12:48| I'd even do that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11568)|
| 3:12:51| and repeat this accessory service for employees of the business that's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11571)|
| 3:12:57| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11577)|
| 3:13:01| What are we trying to accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11581)|
| 3:13:02| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11582)|
| 3:13:04| What we're trying to accomplish is to show that an office park can have a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11584)|
| 3:13:09| so that the employees don't have to drive off-site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11589)|
| 3:13:12| and impact residential neighborhoods or the streets to eat lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11592)|
| 3:13:16| and can actually eat lunch in the hour or 45 minutes or 30 minutes they're allocated for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11596)|
| 3:13:21| I think that's what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11601)|
| 3:13:23| I think some of the comments are actually taking something that is fairly good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11603)|
| 3:13:28| and pretty straightforward and confusing it so much that I'm beginning to be confounded myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11608)|
| 3:13:35| I think what we're doing is we're saying that on 5-1 it's clear this is an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11615)|
| 3:13:40| When you go to the use matrix, it says P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11620)|
| 3:13:43| It's easy to confuse that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11623)|
| 3:13:44| So the solution to that is do an asterisk and then define what it is on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11624)|
| 3:13:49| And I'm comfortable doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11629)|
| 3:13:51| I think that's a great solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11631)|
| 3:13:52| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11632)|
| 3:13:53| So what we need is the language for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11633)|
| 3:13:54| So based on the comments you were hearing, did you have some suggestion on making additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11634)|

| 3:14:20| If we'll look at page 9.1, section 9.2D, why don't we put an explanation there first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11660)|
| 3:14:27| It says for accessory uses, see Article 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11667)|
| 3:14:29| Put another sentence that says P asterisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11669)|
| 3:14:32| Wait, wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11672)|
| 3:14:33| What page are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11673)|
| 3:14:34| We're on page 9.1, just a predicate to the matrix, which is introducing the matrix and what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11674)|
| 3:14:41| And I think under 9.2D or somewhere like that, since it references only accessory uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11681)|
| 3:14:48| put another sentence that says P asterisk shows that there are some accessory uses tied to an existing principle use or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11688)|
| 3:14:58| and they're marked with a P asterisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11698)|
| 3:15:00| Then if he has his footnote, the chart's introduced and warned you ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11700)|
| 3:15:04| I mean, the other alternative is to just, you know, bone up and add another letter to the top of the chart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11704)|
| 3:15:10| and say that AC means accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11710)|
| 3:15:13| But you could help define it in 9.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11713)|
| 3:15:18| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11718)|
| 3:15:19| 9.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11719)|
| 3:15:25| I don't like the idea of asterisks and go to the bottom of the page and look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11725)|
| 3:15:29| I think the chart needs to be the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11729)|
| 3:15:32| I mean, you've got to make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11732)|
| 3:15:34| Going to asterisks and over and flipping over, I don't know, I don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11734)|
| 3:15:40| The asterisks would be at the footnote would be at the bottom of the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11740)|
| 3:15:43| So I look at it and I see P, and then I've got to read the asterisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11743)|
| 3:15:47| I mean, I'm just saying, it just seems like it could be clearer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11747)|
| 3:15:52| Why not give it a special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11752)|
| 3:15:54| Why can't it be a special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11754)|
| 3:15:58| Why change the language back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11758)|
| 3:16:01| It's about special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11761)|
| 3:16:03| Then you get the decision of whether to approve it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11763)|
| 3:16:08| You need flexibility in these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11768)|
| 3:16:10| Office parks, I'm telling you, are struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11770)|
| 3:16:13| And from a business standpoint, we need options on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11773)|
| 3:16:17| And to start saying, oh, no, you can't have this, you can't have that, I'm telling you, they're struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11777)|
| 3:16:21| So there's other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11781)|
| 3:16:23| There's other new uses coming along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11783)|
| 3:16:25| And I don't see restricting it as a really good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11785)|
| 3:16:28| And I don't like the asterisks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11788)|
| 3:16:30| Okay, well, I'm comfortable with the special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11790)|
| 3:16:32| If that addresses Councilmember Roberto's problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11792)|
| 3:16:36| I think we can get to the issues that Ms. Malone addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11796)|
| 3:16:46| I think we just have to be clear about that's the issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11806)|
| 3:16:50| It's not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11810)|
| 3:16:52| I'll speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11812)|
| 3:16:53| And I'm not sure if a special use is the right way to go or if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11813)|
| 3:17:00| it's not a principal use, just take the P out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11820)|
| 3:17:06| Or, I mean, I guess the other question is, if we did another letter, like accessory AC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11826)|
| 3:17:15| would you have a lot of other places where you'd have to add the AC onto there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11835)|
| 3:17:21| Or would it only be these four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11841)|
| 3:17:23| There would be a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11843)|
| 3:17:24| Then we'd create a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11844)|
| 3:17:28| Well, change your definitions on 5.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11848)|
| 3:17:30| Instead of saying accessories, by special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11850)|
| 3:17:34| Then it's back to you to make the zoning administrator to make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11854)|
| 3:17:38| We wouldn't even have to change that definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11858)|
| 3:17:40| and 5.1 would just identify it as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11860)|
| 3:17:43| It's a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11863)|
| 3:17:45| I mean, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11865)|
| 3:17:46| It's a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11866)|
| 3:17:47| At least you've got an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11867)|
| 3:17:52| I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11872)|
| 3:17:53| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11873)|
| 3:17:55| I'll listen to the rest of the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11875)|
| 3:17:57| Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11877)|
| 3:17:59| Right now we're saying, instead of in the office park changing P to P asterisk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11879)|
| 3:18:05| that it would be changed to special use, join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11885)|
| 3:18:09| Yeah, that's what Councilman Wall said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11889)|
| 3:18:12| That's Councilman Wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11892)|
| 3:18:13| So, Councilman Ryder, did you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11893)|
| 3:18:16| I don't even know what to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11896)|
| 3:18:18| Well, doesn't that make it a stand-alone use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11898)|
| 3:18:22| Elsewhere in the ordinance it says it can't be in a stand-alone building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11902)|
| 3:18:26| so that would be one of the review criteria for the special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11906)|
| 3:18:29| We would assure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11909)|
| 3:18:30| We would assure that it primarily serves the employees of the businesses in the business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11910)|
| 3:18:39| We can't restrict someone from driving in and going to a shop that's in a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11919)|
| 3:18:46| That may be primarily for the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11926)|
| 3:18:51| but trying through its design, its location, to ensure that it primarily serves the employees of that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11931)|
| 3:18:57| I think those types of things could be reviewed during the special use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11937)|
| 3:19:02| I agree with Councilmember Wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11942)|
| 3:19:05| Does that make it easier for the business, the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11945)|
| 3:19:10| To make it a special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11950)|
| 3:19:12| To make it a special use, and they have to go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11952)|
| 3:19:14| If it's just permitted as an accessory use, isn't that less process for the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11954)|
| 3:19:20| If we can get everyone to agree on what an accessory use is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11960)|
| 3:19:24| I don't think anybody disagrees on what an accessory use is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11964)|
| 3:19:27| I think the whole discussion point at the beginning was that it's an accessory use, but it says it's a P in the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11967)|
| 3:19:35| We discussed this last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11975)|
| 3:19:37| We can take it out of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11977)|
| 3:19:39| Just tell us what to do and we'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11979)|
| 3:19:42| A, letter A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11982)|
| 3:19:45| The problem with the A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11985)|
| 3:19:46| I don't think that, because then we end up, well, what about my garage, an accessory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11986)|
| 3:19:55| You don't have a garage as a. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11995)|
| 3:19:58| I know it's not a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=11998)|
| 3:20:00| I think that was the discussion the last meeting was then why is it in the chart at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12000)|
| 3:20:04| We'll just take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12004)|
| 3:20:07| Because it's confusing, because it says it's P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12007)|
| 3:20:10| Well, I think then we take it out, and then the purpose statement of the office use that says that those things may be accessory to the office use would rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12010)|
| 3:20:23| and Peter and his successors would see that those are used permitted as accessory to the service or the businesses in the business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12023)|
| 3:20:36| Because we're not trying to stymie the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12036)|
| 3:20:39| We're fine with the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12039)|
| 3:20:41| It's just the inconsistency in the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12041)|
| 3:20:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12043)|
| 3:20:44| That was the only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12044)|
| 3:20:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12045)|
| 3:20:46| If it was a special use, and so we change it from a P to an S, like Council Member Wall said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12046)|
| 3:20:56| and somebody wanted to put in a retail goods establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12056)|
| 3:21:04| they would have to go through an approval process where somebody would be able to tell them this is actually only supposed to be an accessory use, not a principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12064)|
| 3:21:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12075)|
| 3:21:17| So we would accomplish the clarification that we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12077)|
| 3:21:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12083)|
| 3:21:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12084)|
| 3:21:25| It's correct at the expense of time and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12085)|
| 3:21:28| So the problem with doing it that way is that the owner now has to jump through some hoops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12088)|
| 3:21:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12093)|
| 3:21:34| To deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12094)|
| 3:21:36| Which is not the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| Which is not the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12098)|
| 3:21:39| I mean, the idea is the matrix is a good addition, and we want it to be clear, and that's the problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12099)|
| 3:21:46| Not whether the use is there or not, whether it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12106)|
| 3:21:50| I would, trying to sort out the easiest way, the least hurdles for the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12110)|
| 3:21:58| I'm going to pose again basically what Council Member Ryder said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12118)|
| 3:22:02| Just take it out of the don't identify it as a permitted use, principal use in the office park district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12122)|
| 3:22:09| The purpose statement of the office park that says those are provided as an accessory and serving them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12129)|
| 3:22:18| And that already says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12138)|
| 3:22:19| And maybe that's the best way to do it because it's not a principal use, so why have Ps there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12139)|
| 3:22:24| I think that's the easiest way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| Do we have a couple people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12147)|
| 3:22:29| Do you want to hear from them right now on this, or do you want to speak to it, Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12149)|
| 3:22:33| I was just going to say maybe this is one of those issues that we should table and go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12153)|
| 3:22:38| I think we might be close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12158)|
| 3:22:40| If not, then I'm going to agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12160)|
| 3:22:42| I think we're starting to get close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12162)|
| 3:22:45| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12165)|
| 3:22:46| Let's keep that idea in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12166)|
| 3:22:48| Sir, please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12168)|
| 3:22:51| Yes, this is Michael Stinson, 1401 Cuesta Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12171)|
| 3:22:54| And just because I do have a few questions here, I would like to just ask if it's okay if I retain my time while I'm waiting for a response on the questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12174)|
| 3:23:02| Well, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12182)|
| 3:23:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12183)|
| 3:23:05| When I was looking through some of this, one of the things that I was catching is I'm trying to find out if there is any protection from residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12185)|
| 3:23:13| or business owners from the recode if they actually find out that their property is now nonconforming with these new guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12193)|
| 3:23:21| Okay, so you're asking a totally separate question from what we're dealing with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12201)|
| 3:23:25| Is that what you're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12205)|
| 3:23:26| Well, I was trying to find out the best way to kind of get this in because it kind of ties into both business and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12206)|
| 3:23:36| There's an article on nonconforming coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12216)|
| 3:23:39| Yes, the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12219)|
| 3:23:42| There's the state vesting law, which is repeated in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12222)|
| 3:23:46| Everything is grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12226)|
| 3:23:47| Yeah, if you'll actually hold on to your question for Articles 15.3 and 17, those are on vesting rights and on nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12227)|
| 3:23:57| And we can get to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12237)|
| 3:23:58| We'll be discussing that when we get to those articles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12238)|
| 3:24:02| Okay, because I was actually trying to find a grandfather clause, and you're saying that that's actually a grandfather clause?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12242)|
| 3:24:08| The nonconformity section of Article 17 is what you're referring to when you say grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12248)|
| 3:24:16| The vesting rights are when the rights are frozen in place based on when an application is filed versus when a new code goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12256)|
| 3:24:24| Okay, so with that actually being the case with the grandfather clause, is there a time limit on that for how long it lasts for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12264)|
| 3:24:31| I mean, I'll defer to counsel, but that almost sounds like something we should probably say for Article 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12271)|
| 3:24:38| We may have other folks with the same questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12278)|
| 3:24:40| Yes, if you don't mind, sir, we'll get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12280)|
| 3:24:43| We're on nine now, and we need to finish this and keep moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12283)|
| 3:24:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12288)|
| 3:24:49| So we will get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12289)|
| 3:24:50| And if for some reason you can't stay with us long enough, then we can contact you, you know, talk to Gerald right there or to Christina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12290)|
| 3:24:59| and they can call and talk to you about that if for some reason you can't wait until we get to that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12299)|
| 3:25:03| All right, I'll try to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12303)|
| 3:25:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12305)|
| 3:25:06| I hope you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12306)|
| 3:25:07| Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12307)|
| 3:25:10| Really quick on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12310)|
| 3:25:11| Just to be really clear, in the current code, eating and drinking establishments, I know it's restaurant and bar, are permitted in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12311)|
| 3:25:20| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12320)|
| 3:25:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12322)|
| 3:25:23| And office park as well, whatever it currently is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12323)|
| 3:25:27| It's P, it's permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12327)|
| 3:25:29| And so we're taking it out of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12329)|
| 3:25:36| I understand the accessory use that we're talking about, but I wanted to echo Councilman Wallace's statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12336)|
| 3:25:43| and also bring up that we have asked for a comparison chart on this use matrix to see what uses have been changed from P to S,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12343)|
| 3:25:51| S to P, or eliminated or added in, because that's a really big change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12351)|
| 3:25:55| and I think we need to provide some more flexibility in these commercial zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12355)|
| 3:25:59| especially brick-and-mortar stores and all of the issues and struggles they're having with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12359)|
| 3:26:04| versus Internet sales and virtual businesses and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12364)|
| 3:26:08| So I would recommend we put P back in in O and office park for eating and drinking establishments as a principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12368)|
| 3:26:15| I think it would be great, you know, in an office park, a larger area, you have an eating and drinking establishment that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12375)|
| 3:26:22| It's not taking up the whole place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12382)|
| 3:26:24| It's one building or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12384)|
| 3:26:26| It's actually walkable from the neighborhoods too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12386)|
| 3:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12388)|
| 3:26:29| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12389)|
| 3:26:32| Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12392)|
| 3:26:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12393)|
| 3:26:34| I don't think eating and drinking establishments are allowed in the O1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12394)|
| 3:26:40| They're probably allowed in maybe the O2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12400)|
| 3:26:44| I don't know that they're allowed in – are they allowed in O3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12404)|
| 3:26:49| I'm looking them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12409)|
| 3:26:52| Now, again, we have no problem with them existing as an accessory use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12412)|
| 3:27:01| and our question is exactly what Councilwoman Ryder pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12421)|
| 3:27:07| If they're accessory, they should not be listed as a permitted use on a chart that only allows principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12427)|
| 3:27:16| not accessory uses, principal and temporary uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12436)|
| 3:27:19| The other thing is the ability to rezone property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12439)|
| 3:27:25| if it's going from office to more commercial uses remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12445)|
| 3:27:32| If we're going to allow all commercial uses as principal uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12452)|
| 3:27:38| eating and drinking establishment, retail sales, personal service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12458)|
| 3:27:42| how is that different – and say it's office – how is that different from a commercial zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12462)|
| 3:27:48| If somebody wants a zone that primarily has that and also office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12468)|
| 3:27:53| it ought to be zone commercial, not office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12473)|
| 3:27:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12478)|
| 3:28:01| Mayor, I think I have a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12481)|
| 3:28:04| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12484)|
| 3:28:05| We'll give it a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12485)|
| 3:28:06| I'm going to make a motion that under eating and drinking establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12486)|
| 3:28:10| personal service establishment, and retail goods establishment in the OP, we remove the P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12490)|
| 3:28:30| It's an accessory use, not a principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12510)|
| 3:28:32| The chart is for principal uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12512)|
| 3:28:34| It's not a principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12514)|
| 3:28:35| Take the P out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12515)|
| 3:28:36| Leave it blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12516)|
| 3:28:38| They look up the section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12518)|
| 3:28:39| They see that it's an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12519)|
| 3:28:41| It solves the clarification problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12521)|
| 3:28:44| Just as a comment, hotel is a permitted use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12524)|
| 3:28:47| which also allows eating and drinking establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12527)|
| 3:28:53| Sort of getting into weeds here about retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12533)|
| 3:28:57| You can have a hotel as a standalone principal use in an OP zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12537)|
| 3:29:03| Eating and drinking establishment, going back to Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12543)|
| 3:29:08| would be an accessory to the principal use of the lodging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12548)|
| 3:29:13| I think that is the most logical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12553)|
| 3:29:19| Councilman Roberto's approach is the most logical way to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12559)|
| 3:29:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12563)|
| 3:29:25| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12565)|
| 3:29:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12566)|
| 3:29:27| So the motion, and was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12567)|
| 3:29:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12569)|
| 3:29:30| Motion under eating and drinking, retail goods, personal services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12570)|
| 3:29:34| and office park OP to remove the P that shows it as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12574)|
| 3:29:40| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12580)|
| 3:29:41| Do you want to speak to that, Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12581)|
| 3:29:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12583)|
| 3:29:44| I just want to clarify for Ms. Roche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12584)|
| 3:29:46| 03, office park district, uses permitted, professional business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12586)|
| 3:29:50| governmental offices, clinics, medical dental, radio, TV, recording studios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12590)|
| 3:29:55| art gallery, museum, public and private schools, telegraph, barber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12595)|
| 3:29:59| beauty, accessory buildings and uses customarily incidental and subordinate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12599)|
| 3:30:04| recreational uses of recycling, personal gardens, community gardens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12604)|
| 3:30:07| market gardens, wireless communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12607)|
| 3:30:09| Uses permitted are review marinas, assisted living, call centers, churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12609)|
| 3:30:13| methadone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12613)|
| 3:30:14| I make no comment on how logical they are, but I don't see restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12614)|
| 3:30:17| I just was answering your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12617)|
| 3:30:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12619)|
| 3:30:20| And it goes to my point that we really need that comparison chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12620)|
| 3:30:23| I think it would help out a lot in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12623)|
| 3:30:25| And we're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12625)|
| 3:30:26| And that is Yeoman's work and a heavy lift, and I appreciate it at the 11th hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12626)|
| 3:30:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12629)|
| 3:30:30| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12630)|
| 3:30:31| The person I assigned that to was not my best friend anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12631)|
| 3:30:40| That person is not looking for another job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12640)|
| 3:30:44| But thank you, Ms. Rocheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12644)|
| 3:30:46| We are working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12646)|
| 3:30:47| Yes, Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12647)|
| 3:30:48| Before we vote, if you look on page 5-2, the following use restrictions apply to the OP district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12648)|
| 3:30:55| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12655)|
| 3:30:56| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12656)|
| 3:30:57| 5-2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12657)|
| 3:30:58| 5-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12658)|
| 3:30:59| Daycare centers are listed in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12659)|
| 3:31:02| So I think Councilman Roberto might want to amend his motion to include removing the P from daycare centers in OP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12662)|
| 3:31:14| Good catch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12674)|
| 3:31:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12675)|
| 3:31:16| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12676)|
| 3:31:17| And daycare centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12677)|
| 3:31:19| I'm amending that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12679)|
| 3:31:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12680)|
| 3:31:21| He's accepting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12681)|
| 3:31:22| And our scribes have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12682)|
| 3:31:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12685)|
| 3:31:26| Councilwoman, before the vote, so if I want to open an eating establishment in an OP district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12686)|
| 3:31:33| what hoops do I have to jump through now if the P is gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12693)|
| 3:31:37| If it's not permitted to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12697)|
| 3:31:39| You would just have to make sure, and I'll try to speak for Peter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12699)|
| 3:31:43| that it's not a comply with some of the standards and not in a stand-alone building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12703)|
| 3:31:52| You would have to somehow prove to Peter or his employees that it's accessory to the businesses there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12712)|
| 3:32:01| primarily serves the employees of the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12721)|
| 3:32:06| And that would be his discretion and your argument in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12726)|
| 3:32:16| I'm going to go back to Section 5.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12736)|
| 3:32:20| Regulations are found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12740)|
| 3:32:23| Comply with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12743)|
| 3:32:25| Let's keep talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12745)|
| 3:32:27| Say that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12747)|
| 3:32:28| You're asking how we're going to regulate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12748)|
| 3:32:30| We're going to just go back to Section 5.2 on page 5-2 and follow the regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12750)|
| 3:32:39| which are spelled out pretty clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12759)|
| 3:32:46| So in 5.2C, the following use restrictions apply to the OP district, daycare centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12766)|
| 3:32:52| eating and drinking establishments, personal service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12772)|
| 3:33:02| We're just going to make sure they're integrated into a larger building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12782)|
| 3:33:10| So my example would be, and we've used this example previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12790)|
| 3:33:15| the Arbery's there that kind of sits in the middle of that office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12795)|
| 3:33:20| It's a stand-alone building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12800)|
| 3:33:22| But are we saying that if I wanted to open an Arbery's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12802)|
| 3:33:26| I would now have to be inside an established office building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12806)|
| 3:33:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12810)|
| 3:33:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12814)|
| 3:33:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12815)|
| 3:33:37| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12817)|
| 3:33:38| Oh, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12818)|
| 3:33:39| Amy, do you want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12819)|
| 3:33:41| Well, I just wanted to point out a couple of examples, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12821)|
| 3:33:44| in town where we have these in single-use buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12824)|
| 3:33:47| The Atrium Building at Wise Garber has a restaurant, the Lunchbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12827)|
| 3:33:52| Anybody can stop by there as part of a single office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12832)|
| 3:33:56| Cherokee Mills on Sutherland had a restaurant in there for quite some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12836)|
| 3:34:02| and can serve anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12842)|
| 3:34:04| I think it would be pretty hard for him to decide, okay, how many are primary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12844)|
| 3:34:09| Is there 50 plus one coming in here every day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12849)|
| 3:34:13| I also want to talk about retail goods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12853)|
| 3:34:15| I'm thinking Knoxville Comprehensive Breast Center is located in Dow Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12855)|
| 3:34:20| It's an office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12860)|
| 3:34:22| But they also have, inside the imaging center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12862)|
| 3:34:25| have a retail store for women who have experienced mastectomies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12865)|
| 3:34:32| I think the flexibility is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12872)|
| 3:34:35| I think we can point to a lot of good examples and good businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12875)|
| 3:34:40| but we don't want to constrain it, again, so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12880)|
| 3:34:45| We've got really good examples of businesses that have flourished in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12885)|
| 3:34:49| and I don't think we want to use this to constrict them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12889)|
| 3:34:55| Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12895)|
| 3:34:58| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12898)|
| 3:35:00| First, I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12900)|
| 3:35:02| I believe last time we met, 14, 15, 16 days ago, that we looked up the Aubrey's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12902)|
| 3:35:07| and it is not zoned OP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12907)|
| 3:35:09| I think it's zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12909)|
| 3:35:11| I feel like we looked it up, but that's just one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12911)|
| 3:35:14| But I think what Ms. Roche just said, and if I understand an accessory structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12914)|
| 3:35:20| if it's an accessory use in an office park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12920)|
| 3:35:22| does it have to be within an existing building like Cherokee Mills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12922)|
| 3:35:27| or the Lunchbox or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12927)|
| 3:35:29| Can it be its own freestanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12929)|
| 3:35:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12931)|
| 3:35:32| That is what the standard for the office park is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12932)|
| 3:35:34| Those uses, the daycare, the personal services, the retail goods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12934)|
| 3:35:40| and the eating and drinking establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12940)|
| 3:35:43| 5-2 states that such uses are prohibited as standalone structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12943)|
| 3:35:51| Such uses must be integrated into larger office buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12951)|
| 3:35:57| within an office park district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12957)|
| 3:35:59| And some of this will obviously come down to how those different areas are zoned or mapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12959)|
| 3:36:05| Which is what Ms. Malone pointed out, that they could be zoned for such if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12965)|
| 3:36:11| like the Aubrey's is zoned for whatever, for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12971)|
| 3:36:15| And this standard about them being prohibited in standalone buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12975)|
| 3:36:19| was added in an earlier draft in response to some of the concerns you've heard this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12979)|
| 3:36:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12986)|
| 3:36:27| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12987)|
| 3:36:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12988)|
| 3:36:29| Just to clarify, what we're voting on right now is removing the P from those uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12989)|
| 3:36:38| under office park in the matrix, which is not going to prohibit those uses in the office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=12998)|
| 3:36:44| It is just going to clarify that they're permitted, but they're accessory uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13004)|
| 3:36:50| Accessory uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13010)|
| 3:36:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13011)|
| 3:36:52| I'm hearing a separate discussion now, and I could be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13012)|
| 3:36:54| about something that we actually already went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13014)|
| 3:36:58| but we might have to revisit it around those uses being in standalone buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13018)|
| 3:37:03| versus integrated into a larger building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13023)|
| 3:37:06| So I just want to make sure that I'm clear about what we're voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13026)|
| 3:37:10| and didn't want to get confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13030)|
| 3:37:13| The motion is about clarifying the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13033)|
| 3:37:17| The use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13037)|
| 3:37:18| It's not about what you should or should not be doing in the office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13038)|
| 3:37:22| Right now it says it's a principal use when it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13042)|
| 3:37:25| It's an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13045)|
| 3:37:26| There could be a discussion about whether you should do that or not in an office park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13046)|
| 3:37:30| but that's independent of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13050)|
| 3:37:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13052)|
| 3:37:33| So let's vote on that particular motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13053)|
| 3:37:36| Are we finished discussing that motion then about removing the P?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13056)|
| 3:37:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13061)|
| 3:37:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13062)|
| 3:37:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13063)|
| 3:37:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13064)|
| 3:37:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13065)|
| 3:37:46| There's a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13066)|
| 3:37:47| One no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13067)|
| 3:37:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13068)|
| 3:37:49| So it passes 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13069)|
| 3:37:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13070)|
| 3:37:56| Anything else on the use matrix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13076)|
| 3:38:02| Councilwoman River, did you have another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13082)|
| 3:38:06| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13086)|
| 3:38:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13087)|
| 3:38:08| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13088)|
| 3:38:09| I'm trying to be fast here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13089)|
| 3:38:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13090)|
| 3:38:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13093)|
| 3:38:15| So parking lot in the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13095)|
| 3:38:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13101)|
| 3:38:22| What's your number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13102)|
| 3:38:23| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13103)|
| 3:38:24| I'm finding it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13104)|
| 3:38:25| 9-5 at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13105)|
| 3:38:28| The parking lot had principal use next to it, and it struck principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13108)|
| 3:38:35| And then in the definition for parking lot, principal use also got struck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13115)|
| 3:38:41| I guess the confusion is, are these free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13121)|
| 3:38:44| Because it has it as a special use in CG, special use in CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13124)|
| 3:38:48| So are those, like, parking lots not as principal uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13128)|
| 3:38:52| No, they're principal uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13132)|
| 3:38:53| It was a reiteration because the top column, the heading for that column is principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13133)|
| 3:39:00| It's just a typo, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13140)|
| 3:39:01| Basically a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13141)|
| 3:39:02| If I call something that's a principal use, then say it's a principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13142)|
| 3:39:05| So they're freestanding lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13145)|
| 3:39:07| They would be freestanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13147)|
| 3:39:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13148)|
| 3:39:09| And the standards for the parking ordinance apply to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13149)|
| 3:39:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13151)|
| 3:39:12| Even though they don't have a building and they are the principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13152)|
| 3:39:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13154)|
| 3:39:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13155)|
| 3:39:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13156)|
| 3:39:17| Maybe I don't have another question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13157)|
| 3:39:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13160)|
| 3:39:21| And then storage yard outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13161)|
| 3:39:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13168)|
| 3:39:29| So storage yard outdoor is a secondary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13169)|
| 3:39:35| But then we also have outdoor storage on page 1011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13175)|
| 3:39:40| And I don't mean to muddy the waters by going to another section, which is an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13180)|
| 3:39:46| I'm just trying to understand the difference in the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13186)|
| 3:39:50| And one of the questions about it is storage on page 95 of the matrix, storage yard outdoor secondary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13190)|
| 3:40:00| So that's an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13200)|
| 3:40:03| It's listed as a special use in a CG, but CG is our replacement C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13203)|
| 3:40:10| So we're now going to have outdoor storage yards in CG is what the proposed is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13210)|
| 3:40:18| That was one of the ones I believe when I went through that I said there was a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13218)|
| 3:40:21| We had heard concerns about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13221)|
| 3:40:23| And we wanted the commission or the council's direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13223)|
| 3:40:28| Please pull the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13228)|
| 3:40:29| Can you get the mic closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13229)|
| 3:40:30| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13230)|
| 3:40:31| This was one of those proposed uses on which the staff had received comments and expressions of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13231)|
| 3:40:40| We'd like the council's direction on whether storage yard outdoors as a secondary use should remain as a special use in the CG district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13240)|
| 3:40:56| And that would be like the Mayo Garden Center that has a lot of merchandise stored outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13256)|
| 3:41:05| Well, and then so to further confuse that, if I turn to figure out which page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13265)|
| 3:41:13| On page 94, there's greenhouse nursery retail is a special use in all residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13273)|
| 3:41:21| So I'm trying to maybe I'm confusing things by putting those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13281)|
| 3:41:28| I'm not sure what the relationship is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13288)|
| 3:41:30| Well, you brought up Mayo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13290)|
| 3:41:32| Mayo is not a greenhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13292)|
| 3:41:33| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13293)|
| 3:41:34| But Stanley's is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13294)|
| 3:41:35| Stanley's is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13295)|
| 3:41:36| And Stanley's is designated residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13296)|
| 3:41:39| And that is the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13299)|
| 3:41:41| The main reason that the greenhouse nursery is shown as a special use in a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13301)|
| 3:41:46| We did not want to make Stanley's non-conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13306)|
| 3:41:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13313)|
| 3:41:56| Also, we did not feel that heavy commercial or any commercial zoning would be appropriate in the middle of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13316)|
| 3:42:05| I guess my question is, and this is a map question for Councilwoman Welch, why is Stanley's zone residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13325)|
| 3:42:12| Why wouldn't they be like CN or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13332)|
| 3:42:18| I have to answer that question right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13338)|
| 3:42:20| They're zoned residential now, and we just continued that residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13340)|
| 3:42:24| CN is actually designated for small areas for more retail, more traditional retail located within the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13344)|
| 3:42:34| small areas, small stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13354)|
| 3:42:37| Greenhouse nursery is a very special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13357)|
| 3:42:44| And the Stanley's live on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13364)|
| 3:42:46| Well, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13366)|
| 3:42:48| I'm aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13368)|
| 3:42:49| I recall when I was in, just before I started school here, I worked at Kenzie Gardens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13369)|
| 3:42:57| which was a nursery greenhouse in the middle at that time of Holston Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13377)|
| 3:43:02| And I think traditionally those started in residential neighborhoods and either expanded or moved out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13382)|
| 3:43:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13393)|
| 3:43:14| So going back to storage yard outdoor secondary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13394)|
| 3:43:18| What makes that different than outdoor storage as an accessory use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13398)|
| 3:43:23| It's noted on page 1011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13403)|
| 3:43:30| Accessory would be like the Sunbelt rental where they have a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13410)|
| 3:43:38| Peter may correct me, and he's welcome to, but they have a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13418)|
| 3:43:43| They operate out of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13423)|
| 3:43:45| But they also have some of the equipment stored outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13425)|
| 3:43:49| The storage yard outdoors as a principal use, that's all they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13429)|
| 3:43:54| They have outdoor storage and may or may not have a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13434)|
| 3:43:59| And if they have a building, it's a small building that may allow one person to oversee the storage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13439)|
| 3:44:07| But on page 9-5, there's storage yard outdoor as a principal use, but then there's storage yard outdoors as a secondary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13447)|
| 3:44:14| They're both listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13454)|
| 3:44:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13456)|
| 3:44:17| So is storage yard outdoor secondary use different than outdoor storage as an accessory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13457)|
| 3:44:25| The difference, if it's accessory, it's subordinate in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13465)|
| 3:44:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13469)|
| 3:44:30| Versus a secondary, which can be quite sizable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13470)|
| 3:44:34| It's not size limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13474)|
| 3:44:36| If it's a secondary use, we're splitting hairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13476)|
| 3:44:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13480)|
| 3:44:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13481)|
| 3:44:43| Special use, not secondary use, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13483)|
| 3:44:46| That's what we're talking about in the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13486)|
| 3:44:48| Secondary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13488)|
| 3:45:00| The reason the secondary use is identified is we're locating where folks, like if Sunbelt has a massive yard full of equipment, that's not accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13500)|
| 3:45:11| Because if you look in the definition of accessory, it's going to be subordinate in size to the principal structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13511)|
| 3:45:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13518)|
| 3:45:19| So the equivalent in our current zoning storage yard outdoor secondary use would be in a C-4, not in a C-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13519)|
| 3:45:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13525)|
| 3:45:29| I'll have to look that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13529)|
| 3:45:33| Storage is permitted in the C-3 if it's, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13533)|
| 3:45:37| Accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13537)|
| 3:45:38| If it's accessory and not screened from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13538)|
| 3:45:41| And screened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13541)|
| 3:45:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13548)|
| 3:46:07| S means special use, but then it says secondary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13567)|
| 3:46:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13570)|
| 3:46:13| How about, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13573)|
| 3:46:16| How about I'd like to make a motion to strike the special use S in the matrix chart from C-G for storage yard outdoor secondary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13576)|
| 3:46:31| The motion is to strike special use from C-G on storage yard outdoor secondary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13591)|
| 3:46:37| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13597)|
| 3:46:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13598)|
| 3:46:44| Was there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13604)|
| 3:46:49| That's on 9-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13609)|
| 3:46:52| There was a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13612)|
| 3:46:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13613)|
| 3:46:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13614)|
| 3:46:59| While they're looking, you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13619)|
| 3:47:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13621)|
| 3:47:02| Carly Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13622)|
| 3:47:03| I'd like to say if C-3 becomes C-G, and if C-G is supposed to be pedestrian friendly, reminiscent of old business districts, and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13623)|
| 3:47:16| I would think that's the last place where you would want a storage yard secondary that can be larger than the building on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13636)|
| 3:47:24| if I understand Mr. Aaron's distinctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13644)|
| 3:47:30| Accessory storage is one thing, but secondary storage yard where the yard can be bigger than the building does not look like the C-G zone description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13650)|
| 3:47:49| Pedestrian friendly, reminiscent of old business districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13669)|
| 3:47:58| Storage yard doesn't come to mind in that picture, and I would really ask that Councilman Ryder's motion is supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13678)|
| 3:48:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13689)|
| 3:48:12| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13692)|
| 3:48:15| Are you all ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13695)|
| 3:48:16| Repeat what's being struck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13696)|
| 3:48:18| We're on page 9-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13698)|
| 3:48:20| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13700)|
| 3:48:21| Storage yard outdoor secondary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13701)|
| 3:48:24| If you look at the S under C-G, it was actually added in this draft that's in the blue and underlined there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13704)|
| 3:48:32| Because it's not accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13712)|
| 3:48:33| There aren't standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13713)|
| 3:48:34| It could be any size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13714)|
| 3:48:42| Still got to go through the review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13722)|
| 3:48:46| Still got to go through the planning and get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13726)|
| 3:48:52| It's not automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13732)|
| 3:48:58| No, but they're still eligible for, according to page 10-11, outdoor storage accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13738)|
| 3:49:07| The following uses are permitted outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13747)|
| 3:49:10| Non-residential uses are permitted outdoor storage as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13750)|
| 3:49:15| It has multiple uses, and then it has some standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13755)|
| 3:49:22| Outdoor storage must comply with the following provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13762)|
| 3:49:25| No outdoor storage is permitted in any public right-of-way or located so that it obstructs pedestrian or vehicular traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13765)|
| 3:49:30| Outdoor storage is prohibited in a required setback in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13770)|
| 3:49:35| No required parking area may be used as outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13775)|
| 3:49:39| I mean, I think part of it, it seems very redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13779)|
| 3:49:45| I think the key here, and I'll state that the reason this was put in was staff received a request from some developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13785)|
| 3:49:54| to allow outdoor storage as secondary use, as a principal use in C-G, and felt that was too extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13794)|
| 3:50:02| Again, we get comments that special use, trying to compromise and make everybody mad, so that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13802)|
| 3:50:10| And the key is that as an accessory use, it has to be incidental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13810)|
| 3:50:16| As Peter said, typically the accessory areas for outdoor storage are smaller than the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13816)|
| 3:50:23| and as a secondary use, it could be built or bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13823)|
| 3:50:27| Again, point out Mayo, and I think their outdoor area, especially in the spring, is larger than their indoor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13827)|
| 3:50:40| Call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13840)|
| 3:50:43| I've got an answer for you, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13843)|
| 3:50:45| I don't know what the answer is to, but go ahead. Tell me the question to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13845)|
| 3:50:47| Outdoor storage in C-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13847)|
| 3:50:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13849)|
| 3:50:50| It is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13850)|
| 3:50:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13851)|
| 3:50:52| It must be incidental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13852)|
| 3:50:53| Yes, that means it's accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13853)|
| 3:50:55| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13855)|
| 3:50:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13856)|
| 3:50:57| It means it is related to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13857)|
| 3:50:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13859)|
| 3:51:00| For the purpose of this example, I'll talk about a small contractor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13860)|
| 3:51:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13865)|
| 3:51:06| Which they don't really work out of there, but they've got a sizable yard with building materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13866)|
| 3:51:14| The building materials are incidental to the primary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13874)|
| 3:51:17| They're permitted to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13877)|
| 3:51:19| It can be larger than the building, but in C-3, there are protections of setbacks and screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13879)|
| 3:51:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13887)|
| 3:51:28| Under recode, we define accessory uses as subordinate in area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13888)|
| 3:51:35| So they're smaller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13895)|
| 3:51:38| I'm running out of space. I don't know where I'm going with this, but I wanted to give you a context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13898)|
| 3:51:45| 140 characters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13905)|
| 3:51:47| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13907)|
| 3:51:48| One of the differences between a secondary use is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13908)|
| 3:51:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13913)|
| 3:51:54| So what you're describing to me, outdoor storage, in our current C-3 code, does have some standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13914)|
| 3:52:01| It has standards for setbacks and screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13921)|
| 3:52:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13924)|
| 3:52:05| But does this have any standards to it, like our current C-3 outdoor storage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13925)|
| 3:52:12| As a secondary use or as an accessory use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13932)|
| 3:52:14| As a secondary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13934)|
| 3:52:15| I just described that it has some standards as an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13935)|
| 3:52:19| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13939)|
| 3:52:20| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13940)|
| 3:52:25| I think that's the crux of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13945)|
| 3:52:28| Let me look at 9.3 cc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13948)|
| 3:52:40| Oh, that's after the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13960)|
| 3:52:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13962)|
| 3:52:43| But you get there by reference in the use matrix, the column all the way to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13963)|
| 3:52:48| So you'll see on page 9-19 that in commercial districts, a class B buffer yard per section 12.9 and a solid wall or fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13968)|
| 3:53:00| a minimum of six feet and a maximum of eight feet in height, is required along all lines of the storage yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13980)|
| 3:53:08| including any storage yards, as an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13988)|
| 3:53:13| So there are some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13993)|
| 3:53:14| But not storage yards as an...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13994)|
| 3:53:16| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13996)|
| 3:53:17| How about storage yards as a secondary use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13997)|
| 3:53:19| That's what led us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=13999)|
| 3:53:20| That's what led us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14000)|
| 3:53:21| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14001)|
| 3:53:22| Those standards apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14002)|
| 3:53:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14004)|
| 3:53:25| So they're kind of the same and it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14005)|
| 3:53:27| No, the standards as proposed in here, class B buffer and the fence, are much...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14007)|
| 3:53:34| More stringent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14014)|
| 3:53:35| More stringent than the existing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14015)|
| 3:53:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14017)|
| 3:53:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14019)|
| 3:53:42| I withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14022)|
| 3:53:44| How about I withdraw my motion first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14024)|
| 3:53:46| And then that cancels out your second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14026)|
| 3:53:49| So you're withdrawing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14029)|
| 3:53:50| I'm withdrawing my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14030)|
| 3:53:51| Okay, withdrawing that to strike the yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14031)|
| 3:53:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14034)|
| 3:53:55| Get people ready to vote on it, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14035)|
| 3:53:57| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14037)|
| 3:53:58| Which way were you going to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14038)|
| 3:54:00| I was going to vote no, I'll tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14040)|
| 3:54:02| You want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14042)|
| 3:54:05| Doesn't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14045)|
| 3:54:06| They withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14046)|
| 3:54:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14047)|
| 3:54:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14048)|
| 3:54:09| Anything else on the use matrix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14049)|
| 3:54:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14054)|
| 3:54:15| I'm going to declare that finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14055)|
| 3:54:18| So, yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14058)|
| 3:54:19| We have now gone halfway through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14059)|
| 3:54:21| We are on ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14061)|
| 3:54:24| Everybody give yourselves a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14064)|
| 3:54:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14066)|
| 3:54:28| Coffee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14068)|
| 3:54:29| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14069)|
| 3:54:30| Just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14070)|
| 3:54:31| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14071)|
| 3:54:32| You're not going to blow my bubble here, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14072)|
| 3:54:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14075)|
| 3:54:36| Vehicle rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14076)|
| 3:54:37| And this, I think, was added to draft five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14077)|
| 3:54:40| Enclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14080)|
| 3:54:41| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14081)|
| 3:54:44| What page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14084)|
| 3:54:45| What page are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14085)|
| 3:54:46| 9-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14086)|
| 3:54:48| 9-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14088)|
| 3:54:50| It's in the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14090)|
| 3:54:51| The matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14091)|
| 3:54:54| Vehicle rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14094)|
| 3:54:55| 9-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14095)|
| 3:54:56| 9-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14096)|
| 3:54:57| Enclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14097)|
| 3:54:59| And if you read the definition, it's an establishment that rents automobiles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14099)|
| 3:55:03| vans, including incidental parking and servicing of rental vehicles, a motor vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14103)|
| 3:55:08| A rental establishment may maintain an inventory of the vehicles for sale or lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14108)|
| 3:55:13| either onsite or a nearby location, and may provide onsite facilities for the repair and service of the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14113)|
| 3:55:18| Sold or leased by the dealership vehicle rental does not include truck rental establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14118)|
| 3:55:23| or a rental of heavy equipment, which is considered part of heavy retail rental and service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14123)|
| 3:55:28| The question is, what does enclosed mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14128)|
| 3:55:31| It would mean that all the operation would have to be within a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14131)|
| 3:55:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14136)|
| 3:55:37| Can we then change enclosed to indoors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14137)|
| 3:55:43| On the use matrix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14143)|
| 3:55:45| On the definition of vehicle rental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14145)|
| 3:55:49| And then I would not have a problem with it staying in CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14149)|
| 3:55:53| But I don't know what enclosed means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14153)|
| 3:55:55| I think that's simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14155)|
| 3:55:58| Change the definition to indoor from enclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14158)|
| 3:56:01| Change the term to vehicle rental indoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14161)|
| 3:56:04| I can't hear you, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14164)|
| 3:56:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14165)|
| 3:56:08| Trying to address Ms. Malone, I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14168)|
| 3:56:10| Trying to look in turn, I know, speak in turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14170)|
| 3:56:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14172)|
| 3:56:13| I think that would make it more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14173)|
| 3:56:15| I have no issue with making it vehicle rental indoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14175)|
| 3:56:21| And that would just be on the use matrix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14181)|
| 3:56:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14183)|
| 3:56:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14184)|
| 3:56:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14185)|
| 3:56:26| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14186)|
| 3:56:27| Is there a motion to change to indoors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14187)|
| 3:56:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14193)|
| 3:56:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14194)|
| 3:56:41| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14201)|
| 3:56:42| Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14202)|
| 3:56:43| Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14203)|
| 3:56:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14205)|
| 3:56:46| So the motion is to change the name to indoors on the use matrix on page 9-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14206)|
| 3:56:50| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14210)|
| 3:56:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14212)|
| 3:56:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14213)|
| 3:56:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14214)|
| 3:56:55| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14215)|
| 3:56:56| I'm going to ask one more question about matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14216)|
| 3:56:57| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14217)|
| 3:56:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14218)|
| 3:56:59| You would have to ask your colleagues if they will listen to another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14219)|
| 3:57:02| Green, I'm so, so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14222)|
| 3:57:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14224)|
| 3:57:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14225)|
| 3:57:06| I want to revisit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14226)|
| 3:57:07| No, I'm teasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14227)|
| 3:57:08| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14228)|
| 3:57:09| 9-5, self-storage facility enclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14229)|
| 3:57:13| Could that also be indoors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14233)|
| 3:57:15| Is there a reason why that's enclosed just for consistency of language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14235)|
| 3:57:19| We use the term outdoor consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14239)|
| 3:57:23| Would that get the meaning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14243)|
| 3:57:25| Is it defined in the definitions that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14245)|
| 3:57:28| I think it's on page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14248)|
| 3:57:37| I'm looking for continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14257)|
| 3:57:39| Actually, the only thing that it does take self-storage facility enclosed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14259)|
| 3:57:46| so we would have to change the term in the definitions and on the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14266)|
| 3:57:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14271)|
| 3:57:52| It's defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14272)|
| 3:57:53| The other wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14273)|
| 3:57:54| I'm not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14274)|
| 3:58:00| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14280)|
| 3:58:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14281)|
| 3:58:02| I'm going to leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14282)|
| 3:58:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14283)|
| 3:58:04| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14284)|
| 3:58:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14285)|
| 3:58:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14286)|
| 3:58:07| Anybody else want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14287)|
| 3:58:09| I barged my bubble on the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14289)|
| 3:58:16| Arlene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14296)|
| 3:58:19| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14299)|
| 3:58:23| Temporary storage container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14303)|
| 3:58:28| Where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14308)|
| 3:58:39| What page is it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14319)|
| 3:58:40| It's on page 9-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14320)|
| 3:58:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14322)|
| 3:58:43| Down toward the bottom of the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14323)|
| 3:58:45| Temporary outdoor storage container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14325)|
| 3:58:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14327)|
| 3:58:48| Why are they not allowed in CG, CH, CR, DK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14328)|
| 3:58:54| If you read the definition, you know, in OP and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14334)|
| 3:58:57| If you read the definition, you know, it's for temporarily storing stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14337)|
| 3:59:04| while you're fixing or doing whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14344)|
| 3:59:08| And I guess it makes us somewhat suspicious since they're not listed as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14348)|
| 3:59:13| temporary in those zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14353)|
| 3:59:15| Are they meant to be permanent in those zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14355)|
| 3:59:18| Because, as you know, we've had a problem with those where temporary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14358)|
| 3:59:25| containers become replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14365)|
| 3:59:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14370)|
| 3:59:31| Replace building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14371)|
| 3:59:39| That was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14379)|
| 3:59:41| So, I mean, I guess we just don't understand, given the definition of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14381)|
| 3:59:45| and given where they're allowed, why are they not allowed in other places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14385)|
| 3:59:49| Is there a reason for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14389)|
| 3:59:53| That either of us or either Mr. Aarons and I are aware of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14393)|
| 3:59:59| You're not aware of them existing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14399)|
| 4:00:00| No, I'm not aware of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14400)|
| 4:00:02| Because I'll take you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14402)|
| 4:00:03| I've been by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14403)|
| 4:00:05| Wasn't that a song?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14405)|
| 4:00:10| You're not aware of why these are blank in this matrix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14410)|
| 4:00:14| Yeah, I'm not aware of why it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14414)|
| 4:00:18| Let's make temporary everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14418)|
| 4:00:20| Yeah, outdoor storage centers temporary in all zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14420)|
| 4:00:24| Okay, that's a motion by Councilman Lawless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14424)|
| 4:00:27| And second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14427)|
| 4:00:33| That's to make on page 9-6 under temporary outdoor storage container| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14433)|
| 4:00:38| in the zones of CG, CH, CR, and DK, you would add T to the matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14438)|
| 4:00:49| I said all zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14449)|
| 4:00:51| Oh, in all zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14451)|
| 4:00:52| Sorry, all zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14452)|
| 4:00:53| It goes all the way to open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14453)|
| 4:00:55| Okay, all zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14455)|
| 4:00:57| Do we want them in open space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14457)|
| 4:00:58| I would keep them out of open space and natural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14458)|
| 4:01:03| So not the last two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14463)|
| 4:01:07| Councilman, it's your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14467)|
| 4:01:08| You've got buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14468)|
| 4:01:09| You've got businesses that are in open space, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14469)|
| 4:01:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14474)|
| 4:01:16| Country club?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14476)|
| 4:01:17| Parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14477)|
| 4:01:18| Country club?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14478)|
| 4:01:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14479)|
| 4:01:21| Maybe open space but not natural area, natural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14481)|
| 4:01:25| Maybe not natural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14485)|
| 4:01:26| Okay, I'll take it out of natural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14486)|
| 4:01:28| So you want to add it in open space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14488)|
| 4:01:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14489)|
| 4:01:30| You've got businesses in country club or whatever in open space, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14490)|
| 4:01:36| Okay, so this adds to all the zones except natural area in A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14496)|
| 4:01:43| Did you want to speak to that, Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14503)|
| 4:01:48| Somebody call for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14508)|
| 4:01:50| Here, I'll turn off my light for a second and then I'll turn it back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14510)|

| 4:01:55| I'm ready to vote on whatever it is we have on the floor and then I'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14515)|
| 4:01:58| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14518)|
| 4:01:59| We're ready to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14519)|
| 4:02:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14520)|
| 4:02:01| This is on the temporary, temporary outdoor storage container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14521)|
| 4:02:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14524)|
| 4:02:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14525)|
| 4:02:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14526)|
| 4:02:07| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14527)|
| 4:02:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14528)|
| 4:02:09| Now, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14529)|
| 4:02:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14530)|
| 4:02:11| Don't anybody scream at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14531)|
| 4:02:12| Page 224.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14532)|
| 4:02:15| Peter told me while we were eating pizza he wanted to go back to Chapter 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14535)|
| 4:02:21| Angie ratted you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14541)|
| 4:02:23| No, he was teasing but I'm serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14543)|
| 4:02:27| Temporary outdoor storage containers, I'll start there but I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14547)|
| 4:02:32| I think it's a bad practice to define definitions with the words themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14552)|
| 4:02:36| Unless legal has a different suggestion, for example, this one's temporary self-storage containers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14556)|
| 4:02:43| I would say portable or short-term units delivered to a residence or business to store belongings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14563)|
| 4:02:55| and then picked up and returned to a warehouse until called for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14575)|
| 4:02:58| All of these temporary definitions use the words temporary to define what temporary is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14578)|
| 4:03:07| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14587)|

| 4:03:11| Containers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14591)|
| 4:03:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14592)|
| 4:03:13| Maybe just strike the word temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14593)|
| 4:03:19| Well, if you're going to define a container, you don't define it with the word container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14599)|
| 4:03:24| Which definition are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14604)|
| 4:03:26| So for temporary outdoor storage container, change that to self...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14606)|
| 4:03:35| Would you like staff to provide recommendations at the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14615)|
| 4:03:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14618)|
| 4:03:39| These definitions are, I know, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14619)|
| 4:03:41| We'll work on the temporary definitions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14621)|
| 4:03:43| Without using the word temporary or without using the title of the word to define itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14623)|
| 4:03:48| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14628)|
| 4:03:49| Director Green will be on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14629)|
| 4:03:52| Or whichever staff member is no longer speaking to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14632)|
| 4:03:56| I'll work on them come Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14636)|
| 4:03:59| I'll be on summer break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14639)|
| 4:04:01| So somebody restate the request for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14641)|
| 4:04:09| They're going to define the definitions of temporary and come back with suggested verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14649)|
| 4:04:16| Is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14656)|
| 4:04:17| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14657)|
| 4:04:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14658)|
| 4:04:19| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14659)|
| 4:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14662)|
| 4:04:23| So I don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14663)|
| 4:04:24| We don't need to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14664)|
| 4:04:25| That's just a directive to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14665)|
| 4:04:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14667)|
| 4:04:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14673)|
| 4:04:34| Anything else for the use of nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14674)|
| 4:04:39| I'm really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14679)|
| 4:04:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14680)|
| 4:04:41| I think I see nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14681)|
| 4:04:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14683)|
| 4:04:44| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14684)|
| 4:04:45| We are now on Article 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14685)|
| 4:04:49| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14689)|
| 4:04:50| Also, I've scratched all over my document here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14690)|
| 4:04:54| But look, we have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14694)|
| 4:04:56| We'll first ask Gerald to go through Article 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14696)|
| 4:04:59| But we have a couple of staff recommendations for 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14699)|
| 4:05:05| But we'll go ahead and let...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14705)|
| 4:05:07| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14707)|
| 4:05:08| Carleen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14708)|
| 4:05:09| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14709)|
| 4:05:10| You have another nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14710)|
| 4:05:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14712)|
| 4:05:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14713)|
| 4:05:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14714)|
| 4:05:15| I mean, we got through the matrix, but there are other pages in Article 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14715)|
| 4:05:20| I think we covered them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14720)|
| 4:05:24| We had kind of gone through them, hadn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14724)|
| 4:05:28| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14728)|
| 4:05:29| We did the temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14729)|
| 4:05:30| We did the sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14730)|
| 4:05:31| We went all the way through to 9-33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14731)|
| 4:05:38| Well, let me ask about salvage yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14738)|
| 4:05:41| What page is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14741)|
| 4:05:42| 9-18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14742)|
| 4:05:44| 9-18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14744)|
| 4:05:51| They're allowing increased driveway width and number of driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14751)|
| 4:05:58| Where on 9-18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14758)|
| 4:06:00| It starts on the bottom of page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14760)|
| 4:06:02| 17 is item Z, and it continues on page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14762)|
| 4:06:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14766)|
| 4:06:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14767)|
| 4:06:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14768)|
| 4:06:09| 9-18, Article 9, Section 9.3Z, salvage yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14769)|
| 4:06:13| Z3 and Z4 are shown to be deleted, and they got rid of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14773)|
| 4:06:21| As you can see, the limitation on the size of the openings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14781)|
| 4:06:26| I think the reason...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14786)|
| 4:06:30| It may be necessary for some engineering reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14790)|
| 4:06:33| I don't know why you would need more openings, but this is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14793)|
| 4:06:37| The more openings you have, the less effective the screening is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14797)|
| 4:06:41| and the reason...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14801)|
| 4:06:42| And again, some of these things are salvage yards and so on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14802)|
| 4:06:46| are closer to neighborhoods in the older part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14806)|
| 4:06:51| So I guess the question is why are we basically allowing less screening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14811)|
| 4:07:00| It's my understanding that that section was deleted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14820)|
| 4:07:03| because it would be regulated out of Article 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14823)|
| 4:07:07| and be consistent with the rest of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14827)|
| 4:07:10| Which part of Article 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14830)|
| 4:07:19| Which I'm looking forward to getting to, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14839)|
| 4:07:24| Tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14844)|
| 4:07:25| Tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14845)|
| 4:07:26| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14846)|
| 4:07:29| We have more coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14849)|
| 4:07:30| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14850)|
| 4:07:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14852)|
| 4:07:33| So is it in Article 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14853)|
| 4:07:35| Article 11 addresses parking lots and access to right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14855)|
| 4:07:40| and their standards for access and driveway design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14860)|
| 4:07:43| are on page 11-12, section 11.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14863)|
| 4:07:48| Okay, so how about when we get to Article 11, we'll address that, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14868)|
| 4:07:52| But, Ms. Ballone, I think it was just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14872)|
| 4:07:54| The intent was to keep everything consistent and not separate it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14874)|
| 4:07:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14878)|
| 4:08:00| Okay, I'm going to declare that we are moving on now to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14880)|
| 4:08:04| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14884)|
| 4:08:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14886)|
| 4:08:07| Mr. Green, if you would start kind of quickly reviewing...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14887)|
| 4:08:11| I'm going to hit the major ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14891)|
| 4:08:13| The most significant one was in section 10.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14893)|
| 4:08:18| 10-what page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14898)|
| 4:08:20| 10.2 on page 10-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14900)|
| 4:08:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14902)|
| 4:08:23| It was made clear that the lighting facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14903)|
| 4:08:26| It was made clear that the lighting facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14906)|
| 4:08:29| or lighting standards apply only to new lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14909)|
| 4:08:32| and to alterations to existing lighting but exclude routine maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14912)|
| 4:08:39| There were also additional...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14919)|
| 4:08:41| Under subsection B and C, there were additional standards added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14921)|
| 4:08:46| as recommended by members of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14926)|
| 4:08:49| to better regulate light and impact dental properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14929)|
| 4:08:57| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14937)|
| 4:08:59| On page 10-4, there are a couple of changes that deleted the provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14939)|
| 4:09:07| on accessory structures containing cooking and plumbing facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14947)|
| 4:09:12| and I think that was because that was addressed in the building code or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14952)|
| 4:09:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14958)|
| 4:09:19| Because of the ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14959)|
| 4:09:21| ADUs could be an accessory building, so we were saying an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14961)|
| 4:09:24| You can have an ADU, but if that provision remained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14964)|
| 4:09:27| the ADU couldn't have eating and cooking and plumbing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14967)|
| 4:09:33| so we did not want to have a contradiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14973)|
| 4:09:37| And accessory dwelling units on subsection B on page 10-4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14977)|
| 4:09:41| carrying over to page 10-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14981)|
| 4:09:44| The ability of the building official to vary the building codes was deleted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14984)|
| 4:09:52| and there was a requirement for one off-street parking space for the ADU was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=14992)|
| 4:10:01| Again, major changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15001)|
| 4:10:03| Trying to find the next major change would be on page 10-10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15003)|
| 4:10:09| which deals with home occupation, subsection R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15009)|
| 4:10:15| Clarifying, and there will likely be some comments on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15015)|
| 4:10:18| the draft states that no more than one person other than members of the household| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15018)|
| 4:10:24| residing on the premises may be engaged in such occupation in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15024)|
| 4:10:29| So this would allow a contractor to have a home office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15029)|
| 4:10:32| and their employees work off-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15032)|
| 4:10:35| The signs were standards were deleted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15035)|
| 4:10:39| and just reference Article 13 where all the signed standards are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15039)|
| 4:10:45| Item 7, trying to clarify what can be sold from the home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15045)|
| 4:10:52| Only products produced on premises may be physically sold from the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15052)|

| 4:11:00| And finally, a limitation on the square footage of the home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15060)|
| 4:11:03| that can be devoted to the home occupation limited to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15063)|

| 4:11:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15072)|

| 4:11:18| And those are the major revisions to Article 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15078)|
| 4:11:23| The others are primarily clarification and some grammatical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15083)|
| 4:11:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15089)|

| 4:11:39| On number 5, it says Article 10 on the site development standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15099)|
| 4:11:44| If you look on page 10-9 at the bottom, I think we might have discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15104)|
| 4:11:55| I want to revise the end of the sentence from any lot line to say any side or rear lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15115)|
| 4:12:04| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15124)|
| 4:12:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15125)|
| 4:12:06| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15126)|
| 4:12:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15130)|
| 4:12:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15131)|
| 4:12:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15132)|
| 4:12:14| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15134)|
| 4:12:15| Article 10 on O3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15135)|
| 4:12:27| Oh, then we add 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15147)|
| 4:12:28| Then we have to add number 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15148)|
| 4:12:29| So that was O2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15149)|
| 4:12:31| Then we add number 3, which says all structures under this subsection O| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15151)|
| 4:12:36| must conform with that district's corner side setback as a primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15156)|
| 4:12:41| This was Peter's request for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15161)|
| 4:12:47| Do we need a motion for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15167)|
| 4:12:48| Yes, I need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15168)|
| 4:12:49| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15169)|
| 4:12:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15170)|
| 4:12:51| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15171)|
| 4:12:52| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15172)|
| 4:12:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15174)|
| 4:12:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15175)|
| 4:12:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15176)|
| 4:12:57| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15177)|
| 4:12:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15178)|
| 4:12:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15179)|
| 4:13:00| Anything else in 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15180)|
| 4:13:04| Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15184)|
| 4:13:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15185)|
| 4:13:07| On page 10-11, part U as in university, a possible clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15187)|
| 4:13:13| The first sentence, these regulations apply only to outdoor sales and display| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15193)|
| 4:13:18| located on the lot and suggest adding in non-residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15198)|
| 4:13:25| How would you all feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15205)|
| 4:13:32| I'm fine with it because that's where that outdoor sales and display would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15212)|
| 4:13:37| would be a non-residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15217)|
| 4:13:39| So I think that makes it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15219)|
| 4:13:42| I'll make a motion to make that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15222)|
| 4:13:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15224)|
| 4:13:46| Councilwoman Singh-Perez, are you speaking to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15226)|
| 4:13:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15228)|
| 4:13:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15229)|
| 4:13:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15230)|
| 4:13:51| So that's an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15231)|
| 4:13:54| That's page 10-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15234)|
| 4:13:57| Add under 3D in non-residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15237)|
| 4:14:07| She's asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15247)|
| 4:14:08| Mayor, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15248)|
| 4:14:09| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15249)|
| 4:14:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15250)|
| 4:14:11| And maybe this is a question for Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15251)|
| 4:14:14| Under part U1, if you look down at the second line, it actually references| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15254)|
| 4:14:19| non-residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15259)|
| 4:14:21| So I just wanted to point that out before we make a change to a sentence that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15261)|
| 4:14:24| would apply to all four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15264)|
| 4:14:27| You have greenhouses or nurseries located in, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15267)|
| 4:14:33| just trying to get some sort of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15273)|
| 4:14:39| I mean, maybe it's a good idea, maybe it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15279)|
| 4:14:43| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15283)|
| 4:14:44| With the greenhouse operation designated as residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15284)|
| 4:14:48| I would be hesitant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15288)|
| 4:14:53| That may create some issues because their display,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15293)|
| 4:14:58| would you consider the look to our zoning administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15298)|
| 4:15:02| would you consider all the plants at a greenhouse that's outdoor display?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15302)|
| 4:15:13| And for the record, Peter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15313)|
| 4:15:14| I just ordered you your own microphone for future meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15314)|
| 4:15:18| I think they need to be mic'd up like Madonna so they can hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15318)|
| 4:15:21| Oh, everybody has a headset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15321)|
| 4:15:23| I'll give you a headset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15323)|
| 4:15:27| Feeling the love over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15327)|
| 4:15:32| Yeah, you make a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15332)|
| 4:15:34| If you've got a business in a residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15334)|
| 4:15:37| a nursery business in a residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15337)|
| 4:15:40| that would prohibit them from having outdoor display and storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15340)|
| 4:15:45| That is accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15345)|
| 4:15:47| So I don't know if the right thing to do is to rezone to a CN or apparently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15347)|
| 4:15:59| I wanted to say a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15359)|
| 4:16:01| when I look through all the uses allowed in residential zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15361)|
| 4:16:05| that's like the only retail use we're allowing in a residential zone of that type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15365)|
| 4:16:13| Because of one existing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15373)|
| 4:16:15| I think it's weird to put it in every residential zone because of one existing grandfathered use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15375)|
| 4:16:22| Again, it's zoned residential now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15382)|
| 4:16:24| And the concern about designating, it works well in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15384)|
| 4:16:30| I defer to Council Member Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15390)|
| 4:16:32| It's in her district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15392)|
| 4:16:33| But I have to admit, I'm a frequent shopper there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15393)|
| 4:16:39| Our concern was by designating a commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15399)|
| 4:16:43| you've got this huge commercial land area, a metal residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15403)|
| 4:16:49| I hope that Stanley's goes on for another couple of generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15409)|
| 4:16:53| If I were Mr. Stanley, at his age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15413)|
| 4:16:56| and I had 100 acres of commercial area in the middle of a residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15416)|
| 4:17:01| I'd sell it immediately to anybody who would come and buy it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15421)|
| 4:17:05| and go out on the way out to Rutledge Pike and buy 100 acres for a lot less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15425)|
| 4:17:11| and start my business elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15431)|
| 4:17:13| That was our concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15433)|
| 4:17:14| that we did not want to put that large a commercial zoning designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15434)|
| 4:17:18| in the middle of a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15438)|
| 4:17:21| It was challenging for us to figure out how to enable that use to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15441)|
| 4:17:27| with minimal impact to the community overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15447)|
| 4:17:33| It's just we're trying to figure out other things, workarounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15453)|
| 4:17:37| because of that one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15457)|
| 4:17:38| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15458)|
| 4:17:39| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15459)|
| 4:17:40| I think that's what we've spent many hours doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15460)|
| 4:17:45| workarounds for typically one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15465)|
| 4:17:48| I like Ms. Malone, but that's one person commenting a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15468)|
| 4:17:52| and we're working around a lot of her comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15472)|
| 4:17:55| I think it works out good for the community overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15475)|
| 4:17:58| but the specifics are what drive the general in a lot of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15478)|
| 4:18:04| and it's just the nature of the beast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15484)|
| 4:18:06| In her defense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15486)|
| 4:18:07| there aren't a lot of people that are willing to read all of these pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15487)|
| 4:18:11| That's a rare breed right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15491)|
| 4:18:12| Oh, I admire Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15492)|
| 4:18:14| The only fourth district for our council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15494)|
| 4:18:22| Let me just say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15502)|
| 4:18:23| We also allow country clubs and so on in residential, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15503)|
| 4:18:28| I think probably for the same, I mean, they're really not residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15508)|
| 4:18:31| I think it's probably for much the same reason why greenhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15511)|
| 4:18:37| and so on are permitted in residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15517)|
| 4:18:40| You would hate for large tracts of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15520)|
| 4:18:45| to just automatically be able to go to some other use, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15525)|
| 4:18:50| Do I need to remove the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15530)|
| 4:18:52| I was going to withdraw on my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15532)|
| 4:18:54| What was the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15534)|
| 4:18:55| I thought we were on the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15535)|
| 4:18:56| Oh, you made the motion for what he suggested in non-residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15536)|
| 4:18:59| I followed this former fourth district council person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15539)|
| 4:19:02| After thinking about it, do you all think it's good or a bad idea or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15542)|
| 4:19:08| I don't think it may limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15548)|
| 4:19:10| Again, it's addressing a general issue because of a specific case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15550)|
| 4:19:14| but I think it would create challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15554)|
| 4:19:18| Okay, so we're removing that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15558)|
| 4:19:20| I'm removing my motion after Councilman Starr removed his second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15560)|
| 4:19:25| Okay, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15565)|
| 4:19:27| What else in 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15567)|
| 4:19:32| Anything else in 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15572)|
| 4:19:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15573)|
| 4:19:34| Councilwoman Sincrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15574)|
| 4:19:35| I'd like to speak on the home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15575)|
| 4:19:37| I thought we had made some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15577)|
| 4:19:38| Page number, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15578)|
| 4:19:40| 10-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15580)|
| 4:19:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15581)|
| 4:19:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15582)|
| 4:19:44| Microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15584)|
| 4:19:46| I thought that we had made some changes, but I guess I remembered incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15586)|
| 4:19:49| But I don't think we need to limit the people that end up working there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15589)|
| 4:19:57| I think what's important is that there's no change in the appearance of a residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15597)|
| 4:20:02| that there's not traffic, that there's not noise, glare, fumes, odors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15602)|
| 4:20:09| that it's not noticeable or distracting from the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15609)|
| 4:20:15| So I would like to make an amendment to take out number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15615)|
| 4:20:23| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15623)|
| 4:20:24| To totally remove number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15624)|
| 4:20:26| So the motion would be to remove our home occupation number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15626)|
| 4:20:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15631)|
| 4:20:32| No more than one person other than members of the household residing on the premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15632)|
| 4:20:35| may be engaged in such occupation in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15635)|
| 4:20:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15639)|
| 4:20:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15640)|
| 4:20:41| So who wants to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15641)|
| 4:20:42| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15642)|
| 4:20:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15643)|
| 4:20:44| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15644)|
| 4:20:45| So, yeah, you've limited the amount of gross floor area in the home already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15645)|
| 4:20:50| So which limits it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15650)|
| 4:20:51| And really, that's how you're limiting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15651)|
| 4:20:53| So I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15653)|
| 4:20:54| I fully support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15654)|
| 4:20:57| Who else wants to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15657)|
| 4:20:58| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15658)|
| 4:20:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15659)|
| 4:21:01| I don't know, Ms. Roach, if you want to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15661)|
| 4:21:04| You had made some suggestions on here in a message that I had received earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15664)|
| 4:21:12| The issue here was about how many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15672)|
| 4:21:16| And the comment was that, you know, having one person other than the resident of the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15676)|
| 4:21:23| was maybe not enough given some current opportunities that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15683)|
| 4:21:29| And I don't want to put words in your mouth, so I don't know if you want to address some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15689)|
| 4:21:33| I like your words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15693)|
| 4:21:34| They're working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15694)|
| 4:21:35| My words were good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15695)|
| 4:21:36| I really like that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15696)|
| 4:21:39| I think we kind of have a trend tonight that we need to stick with the impacts to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15699)|
| 4:21:45| That's where we need to regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15705)|
| 4:21:48| To be fair, yes, I did put other solutions down there, and I'll speak to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15708)|
| 4:21:53| We need to, I believe, RICO needs to stick with the impacts to the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15713)|
| 4:21:57| the external environmental impacts, and get out of people's homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15717)|
| 4:22:00| I think that's the trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15720)|
| 4:22:01| We have a big trend in the maker city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15721)|
| 4:22:04| I think we should spur that, spur development and really take on that maker city identity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15724)|
| 4:22:14| The gig economy is on the rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15734)|
| 4:22:15| I mean, that number one that Ms. Perez talks about is in the current code, which is old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15735)|
| 4:22:22| which represents an economy that is very different than what we see today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15742)|
| 4:22:26| Specifically to my group that I represent, realtors, their main office is in their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15746)|
| 4:22:32| The brick and mortar real estate offices are not their main office where they do their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15752)|
| 4:22:38| And because of the broad definition back, Lauren, I'm taking one from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15758)|
| 4:22:42| back in Section 2, Article 2, for home occupations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15762)|
| 4:22:46| the city has very broad enforcement and policing powers to regulate any activity you do in your home for economic gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15766)|
| 4:22:54| I would also like to make a suggestion we add in the word commercial there to give a little more teeth to the private property rights we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15774)|
| 4:23:01| So even with the word commercial, you've got broad regulatory power there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15781)|
| 4:23:07| You've got very reasonable and appropriate external environmental regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15787)|
| 4:23:12| and paragraphs back in Section 10, Article 10, R2 through 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15792)|
| 4:23:17| Added in in this last draft, R8, where you've got the gross floor area limited to 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15797)|
| 4:23:25| I would like to see unlimited persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15805)|
| 4:23:27| I think that would be what would accommodate everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15807)|
| 4:23:32| You'd like to see what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15812)|
| 4:23:33| Unlimited persons allowed to be, you know, I mean, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15813)|
| 4:23:35| Do you agree with striking number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15815)|
| 4:23:37| I agree with that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15817)|
| 4:23:39| If U.S. policymakers feel like that's going a little too far, then we definitely need increases in that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15819)|
| 4:23:47| Maybe it could be up to the occupancy limit that we allow, like we talked about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15827)|
| 4:23:51| Maybe it could be up to another number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15831)|
| 4:23:53| We've floated around the number three, so at least, you know, it's kind of an arbitrary number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15833)|
| 4:23:57| but I think it would take care of most of our members, not all, which is unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15837)|
| 4:24:03| But at the very basic philosophical, you know, reasoning behind this and everything that we stand for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15843)|
| 4:24:11| we would agree with that unlimited amount, taking out number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15851)|
| 4:24:16| because you've got other limitations in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15856)|
| 4:24:19| There are other compromised positions, Andrew, that you and I have talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15859)|
| 4:24:22| and had great conversations about, and I think those are, again, compromised positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15862)|
| 4:24:30| but would take care of at least moving this in the direction of where we could go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15870)|
| 4:24:35| So I want to thank you for all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15875)|
| 4:24:38| Thank you, and I'll just say that, you know, I'm not going to be able to support unlimited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15878)|
| 4:24:44| because I think that detracts from what people are expecting in their residential neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15884)|
| 4:24:51| but I would be willing to make some changes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15891)|
| 4:24:55| So my suggestion would be to say that in replacing number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15895)|
| 4:25:01| no more than three people other than the members of the household residing on the premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15901)|
| 4:25:06| may be engaged in such home occupation, then can comply with each provision of this section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15906)|
| 4:25:12| and then add another one that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15912)|
| 4:25:15| the use of the dwelling unit for the home office shall be clearly incidental and subordinate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15915)|
| 4:25:20| to its use for residential purposes by its occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15920)|
| 4:25:24| So by doing that, it's very clear that all will have to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15924)|
| 4:25:29| Traffic, you know, noise, vibration, all these other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15929)|
| 4:25:34| You're also making it clear that, you know, hey, you could have up to three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15934)|
| 4:25:37| but if you start disrupting the neighborhood, then we're going to reduce that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15937)|
| 4:25:43| And then make it very clear, and the language I did in that second part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15943)|
| 4:25:48| is straight out of home offices right now that's currently in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15948)|
| 4:25:53| So I would make that motion instead of making a motion that we just remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15953)|
| 4:25:58| That's the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15958)|
| 4:25:59| My substitute motion would be that, and I can repeat it if you guys want me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15959)|
| 4:26:02| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15962)|
| 4:26:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15963)|
| 4:26:04| So substitute for number one, no more than three people other than members of the household residing on the premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15964)|
| 4:26:12| may be engaged in such home occupation, then can comply with each provision of this section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15972)|
| 4:26:20| and then below that in a new section, the use of the dwelling unit for the home office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15980)|
| 4:26:25| shall be clearly incidental and subordinate to its use for residential purposes by its occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15985)|
| 4:26:35| So sorry, Councilman, one more time if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15995)|
| 4:26:39| Well, if I don't get a second, then I may not need to write it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=15999)|
| 4:26:45| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16005)|
| 4:26:48| The second one, is that what you wanted, Christina?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16008)|
| 4:26:51| If you can start off with the first sentence ending in may be engaged in such occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16011)|
| 4:26:56| May be engaged in such home occupation, then can comply with each provision of this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16016)|
| 4:27:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16035)|
| 4:27:16| Can I get a second one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16036)|
| 4:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16037)|
| 4:27:18| The use of the dwelling unit for the home office shall be clearly incidental and subordinate to its use for residential purposes by its occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16038)|
| 4:27:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16062)|
| 4:27:44| I'll read it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16064)|
| 4:27:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16065)|
| 4:27:46| Yeah, read it and make sure it's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16066)|
| 4:27:48| And then if passed, then we would change all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16068)|
| 4:27:51| You want that as number two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16071)|
| 4:27:53| Or that would just all be part of number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16073)|
| 4:27:55| Yeah, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16075)|
| 4:27:59| So where it starts, the use, that's number two now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16079)|
| 4:28:05| And then we would just, if passed, we'll renumber all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16085)|
| 4:28:07| Yeah, and then renumber the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16087)|
| 4:28:08| No more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16088)|
| 4:28:10| We might wait until to see if it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16090)|
| 4:28:12| They haven't voted yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16092)|
| 4:28:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16093)|
| 4:28:14| They haven't voted yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16094)|
| 4:28:15| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16095)|
| 4:28:16| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16096)|
| 4:28:17| Mr. DelVolpe said it's not green yet, and I just wanted to point out it's not green because there hasn't been a vote on it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16097)|
| 4:28:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16102)|
| 4:28:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16103)|
| 4:28:24| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16104)|
| 4:28:25| Please go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16105)|
| 4:28:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16106)|
| 4:28:27| I'd like to make an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16107)|
| 4:28:29| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16109)|
| 4:28:30| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16110)|
| 4:28:31| Just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16111)|
| 4:28:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16112)|
| 4:28:33| That's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16113)|
| 4:28:34| A substitute motion to a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16114)|
| 4:28:35| I can't do another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16115)|
| 4:28:36| We can't play dueling motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16116)|
| 4:28:40| What did you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16120)|
| 4:28:42| I want to take out one again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16122)|
| 4:28:44| I don't like one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16124)|
| 4:28:45| I like two a lot, a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16125)|
| 4:28:48| But I still think it's their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16128)|
| 4:28:51| As long as they're not bothering anybody, I don't see that it's our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16131)|
| 4:28:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16135)|
| 4:28:56| So when we vote on this, then if it doesn't pass, then we'll back on your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16136)|
| 4:29:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16142)|
| 4:29:03| Other comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16143)|
| 4:29:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16146)|
| 4:29:07| I want to comment on McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16147)|
| 4:29:08| I'll let McKenzie go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16148)|
| 4:29:10| Oh, you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16150)|
| 4:29:11| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16151)|
| 4:29:12| You're so welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16152)|
| 4:29:13| I promise you I won't take as much research time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16153)|
| 4:29:15| I just want a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16155)|
| 4:29:17| I could have sworn I heard you say no more than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16157)|
| 4:29:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16161)|
| 4:29:22| What does it say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16162)|
| 4:29:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16163)|
| 4:29:24| It still says one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16164)|
| 4:29:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16165)|
| 4:29:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16166)|
| 4:29:27| If you start this, the quote, no more than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16167)|
| 4:29:28| No more than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16168)|
| 4:29:29| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16169)|
| 4:29:30| I put the proposal in quotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16170)|
| 4:29:31| It's very, very hard to see up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16171)|
| 4:29:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16172)|
| 4:29:33| I think she's trying to be careful not to make a change and delete anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16173)|
| 4:29:36| She's not editing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16176)|
| 4:29:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16177)|
| 4:29:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16178)|
| 4:29:39| Since my motion is very verbose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16179)|
| 4:29:42| So I also wanted to ask you, so what is your thought process behind the number three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16182)|
| 4:29:50| The current number is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16190)|
| 4:29:52| And when I've talked with folks in the neighborhoods, they've been very comfortable with the number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16192)|
| 4:30:00| The thought about number three is basically incorporating what Ms. Roach had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16200)|
| 4:30:05| And I think that there may be a need to change from one to another number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16205)|
| 4:30:11| and we could kind of decide what that number would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16211)|
| 4:30:15| I'm not married to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16215)|
| 4:30:18| But that's what one of the compromises that we had talked about could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16218)|
| 4:30:27| You probably need to have more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16227)|
| 4:30:29| But I think the point is in this, you could have three plus the people that live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16229)|
| 4:30:35| and that's probably enough because you don't want to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16235)|
| 4:30:39| I think what we're trying to prevent here is that the house next door becomes a business like full on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16239)|
| 4:30:46| as opposed to this is a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16246)|
| 4:30:49| And I think this deals with that and compromises in a pretty good way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16249)|
| 4:30:56| But it is a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16256)|
| 4:30:58| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16258)|
| 4:30:59| And so, you know, I would like to see if you would consider four rather than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16259)|
| 4:31:09| I think it also gets – if you can hire four people, I mean, you start to be able to afford office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16269)|
| 4:31:13| I mean, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16273)|
| 4:31:14| Well, I mean, and that includes yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16274)|
| 4:31:15| So if I have a home occupation, I count as – would I count as one person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16275)|
| 4:31:19| No, you don't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16279)|
| 4:31:20| These are counting other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16280)|
| 4:31:21| Yeah, you don't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16281)|
| 4:31:22| So we basically have four now with a three plus one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16282)|
| 4:31:25| You could have –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16285)|
| 4:31:26| You and Sam could have a business and hire three people, and you have five people working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16286)|
| 4:31:30| Well, I'm good with the three then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16290)|
| 4:31:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16291)|
| 4:31:33| And thank you for that clarification, Councilwoman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16293)|
| 4:31:35| But you've already limited – I mean, that's – you need all those more regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16295)|
| 4:31:39| when you've already limited the floor space to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16299)|
| 4:31:43| I mean, you continue to – I mean, this is something that is much more the trend of home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16303)|
| 4:31:50| You need latitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16310)|
| 4:31:53| I mean, I just think you're already limited to the number of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16313)|
| 4:31:57| There's only so many people you can fit in 25% of the house anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16317)|
| 4:32:01| And you're saying that it is – it's a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16321)|
| 4:32:07| I mean, you're just being redundant and overkill on some of the wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16327)|
| 4:32:11| and trying to be more restrictive in an era that we're in and going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16331)|
| 4:32:15| that we need more latitude to be able to work out a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16335)|
| 4:32:18| And limiting it, you know, three, is it four, is it five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16338)|
| 4:32:23| I don't know, but you've already limited the gross space to be in the house that you can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16343)|
| 4:32:27| So you can't use the whole house anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16347)|
| 4:32:28| So I can limit it – I can't get 50 people in 25% of the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16348)|
| 4:32:33| And I just think you're trying to limit it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16353)|
| 4:32:36| and you've got these other regulations that are already pretty strict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16356)|
| 4:32:41| And trying to limit the number of people and what they're doing in their house is – I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16361)|
| 4:32:47| I think what it is today, it needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16367)|
| 4:32:49| I mean, we need more latitude in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16369)|
| 4:32:55| Okay, Vice Mayor Sawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16375)|
| 4:32:56| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16376)|
| 4:32:59| How – I guess Peter needs to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16379)|
| 4:33:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16381)|
| 4:33:02| But he left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16382)|
| 4:33:06| Conferring with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16386)|
| 4:33:08| How do you enforce this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16388)|
| 4:33:11| How do you enforce the 25%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16391)|
| 4:33:17| I can tell you what we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16397)|
| 4:33:20| We've knocked on the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16400)|
| 4:33:21| We identify ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16401)|
| 4:33:23| We tell them that there was a complaint registered against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16403)|
| 4:33:26| We ask permission to enter their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16406)|
| 4:33:31| The one time that I'm thinking of, they granted us access to their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16411)|
| 4:33:34| They said this is where we have our little home office set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16414)|
| 4:33:38| We said, can we look inside your garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16418)|
| 4:33:41| They said, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16421)|
| 4:33:43| It looked like a residential garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16423)|
| 4:33:44| We said, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16424)|
| 4:33:45| Have a nice day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16425)|
| 4:33:47| It's really – we do everything that we can without forcing entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16427)|
| 4:33:55| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16435)|
| 4:33:56| I let everybody skip me in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16436)|
| 4:33:58| Peter, I have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16438)|
| 4:34:00| How many complaints have you got, and have you got complaints about number of employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16440)|
| 4:34:04| I see hordes of people coming and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16444)|
| 4:34:06| I think they're violating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16446)|
| 4:34:10| Do you get complaints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16450)|

| 4:34:32| Scott Elder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16472)|
| 4:34:34| We're comedians part time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16474)|
| 4:34:36| Mr. Elder, how many complaints do you get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16476)|
| 4:34:39| Do you have people complaining?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16479)|
| 4:34:40| I see five employees going there, four employees, three employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16480)|
| 4:34:43| Rarely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16483)|
| 4:34:44| There isn't a whole home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16484)|
| 4:34:45| Rarely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16485)|
| 4:34:46| But we do get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16486)|
| 4:34:47| And everybody drives, and the ones that we've had, their cars on the streets every day of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16487)|
| 4:34:54| But, I mean, are we – and you saw, yeah, they had five employees coming and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16494)|
| 4:34:59| What type of business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16499)|
| 4:35:01| I don't need you to tell me who and where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16501)|
| 4:35:03| I'm just trying to get a sense of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16503)|
| 4:35:04| Office business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16504)|
| 4:35:05| I think this was a designer, design professional type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16505)|
| 4:35:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16510)|
| 4:35:11| I just think of home occupation more as an incubator type thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16511)|
| 4:35:14| and that's the experience for my constituents is that they outgrew their home occupation use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16514)|
| 4:35:20| They told me they used 10% of their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16520)|
| 4:35:23| and they still use a small portion for some of their late night stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16523)|
| 4:35:27| but they moved and they incubated there, and they grew, and they moved on and rented office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16527)|
| 4:35:32| And I will remind you guys that at the same time we're also talking about how do we fill up the East Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16532)|
| 4:35:37| and we have all these commercial areas that can't find people to rent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16537)|
| 4:35:41| But let's not have residential districts anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16541)|
| 4:35:44| Let's have our neighbor run their office next door and not be an incubator anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16544)|
| 4:35:49| but just literally turn their whole house into an office by day and sleep at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16549)|
| 4:35:54| But we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16554)|
| 4:35:55| We have work-live combos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16555)|
| 4:35:57| We have shared office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16557)|
| 4:35:59| It's like whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16559)|
| 4:36:01| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16561)|
| 4:36:02| I'm not comfortable with no constraints based on the feedback I get from my constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16562)|
| 4:36:07| as well as my constituents that have done home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16567)|
| 4:36:13| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16573)|
| 4:36:16| Home occupations require a use-owner view, so that's how we get the percentage of the floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16576)|
| 4:36:24| That's how we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16584)|
| 4:36:25| That's how you currently do it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16585)|
| 4:36:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16586)|
| 4:36:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16587)|
| 4:36:29| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16589)|
| 4:36:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16590)|
| 4:36:31| I think we are making some progress on this front, and to go from one to four people, I mean, I think is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16591)|
| 4:36:39| And, you know, to me it comes down to eventually if you're hiring all these people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16599)|
| 4:36:44| eventually you can afford office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16604)|
| 4:36:46| You know, we all know that, you know, Bill Gates started his business in his garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16606)|
| 4:36:50| but eventually they moved out, and that's the whole idea of growing a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16610)|
| 4:36:55| Maybe he bought the house next door and expanded there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16615)|
| 4:36:57| You know, he has a big house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16617)|
| 4:36:58| I mean, he could fit a lot of employees in there, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16618)|
| 4:37:01| But, you know, I think that's where it goes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16621)|
| 4:37:04| And also I think if you think about child care, we limit the number of children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16624)|
| 4:37:08| You know, you can say these things, but when you start to get, say you had 10 people working for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16628)|
| 4:37:14| you know, is that traffic that you might expect in a residential neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16634)|
| 4:37:19| So then you've got that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16639)|
| 4:37:20| So, I mean, I think it makes sense and, you know, I'm supportive of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16640)|
| 4:37:25| Okay, so we are so we have a motion, a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16645)|
| 4:37:29| which is to restrict the number of employees in addition to those who live there to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16649)|
| 4:37:43| So that would be three plus you if you live there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16663)|
| 4:37:46| And then we'll vote on that, and then if that passes, that's the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16666)|
| 4:37:53| If it fails, then we go to the original motion, which is to strike it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16673)|
| 4:37:58| This is good discussion, and it pretty much shows exactly where the public is torn between this as council is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16678)|
| 4:38:05| So we'll see what the majority says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16685)|
| 4:38:07| So the motion is on the three, outside employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16687)|
| 4:38:13| And on the number two, and if this passes, then everything else will be renumbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16693)|
| 4:38:18| Stuff that's highlighted, and then we'll renumber the other little sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16698)|
| 4:38:22| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16702)|
| 4:38:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16704)|
| 4:38:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16705)|
| 4:38:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16706)|
| 4:38:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16707)|
| 4:38:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16708)|
| 4:38:29| How many no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16709)|
| 4:38:30| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16710)|
| 4:38:31| Two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16711)|
| 4:38:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16712)|
| 4:38:33| So this passes seven to two, which allows the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16713)|
| 4:38:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16718)|
| 4:38:39| You have moved in the right direction on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16719)|
| 4:38:41| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16721)|
| 4:38:42| Thank you, Ms. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16722)|
| 4:38:43| So that passes seven to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16723)|
| 4:39:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16741)|
| 4:39:02| Anything else on ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16742)|
| 4:39:09| Ms. Malone, did you have something on ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16749)|
| 4:39:12| And then Councilman Roberto's slide is on ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16752)|
| 4:39:19| Yes, page 10-4, Article 10, Section 10.3A, Accessory Structures and Uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16759)|
| 4:39:26| I meant 10-4 is the page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16766)|
| 4:39:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16768)|
| 4:39:29| And it's Section 10.3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16769)|
| 4:39:36| A, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16776)|
| 4:39:38| And it's a chart, A6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16778)|
| 4:39:44| And the question here, if you compare it with what is done in the existing ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16784)|
| 4:39:51| the question is which structures do you want to dominate the residential lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16791)|
| 4:39:58| the residential building or the accessory buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16798)|
| 4:40:06| What RECODE proposes is just simply using the lot, building lot percentage, the 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16806)|
| 4:40:16| And it does not deal with the ratio between the residential building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16816)|
| 4:40:23| and the sum total of all the accessory structures, especially accessory buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16823)|
| 4:40:33| And, again, I'm not talking about ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16833)|
| 4:40:37| I'm talking about how many garages, sheds, barns, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16837)|
| 4:40:44| If you just use the 30% lot coverage, you could have on a 100-by-100-foot lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16844)|
| 4:40:53| on a 10,000-square-foot lot, you could have a house with a 1,200-square-foot footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16853)|
| 4:41:01| and two 750-square-foot outbuildings and one 300-square-foot outbuilding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16861)|
| 4:41:12| So you end up with a total of 1,800 square feet of outbuilding and 1,200-square-foot house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16872)|
| 4:41:23| Now these would have to be in the backyard, but is that what you want for your neighbor's backyard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16883)|
| 4:41:32| In the material sent to you by the community forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16892)|
| 4:41:35| we included the existing ordinance chart from Article V, Section 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16895)|
| 4:41:41| which in addition to the chart that's on page 10-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16901)|
| 4:41:46| also included a column that had the total of the accessory buildings that could be on the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16906)|
| 4:41:54| a total square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16914)|
| 4:41:56| And if you wanted to exceed that, you could go ask for a use on review to have more considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16916)|
| 4:42:04| And, again, the ordinance, and if you haven't seen it from the existing code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16924)|
| 4:42:15| that came from a situation, and I think when I was here at an earlier date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16935)|
| 4:42:20| I said there was one in Island Home area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16940)|
| 4:42:25| That came right after one in the Fountain City, Cedar Lane area, where a man bought a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16945)|
| 4:42:34| He had plenty of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16954)|
| 4:42:36| He built a rental house, two-story rental house, and built a sports facility for his kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16956)|
| 4:42:44| So all the neighbors lived in the shadow of the sports facility, and it was perfectly legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16964)|
| 4:42:50| because we had the 30% lot coverage, but we didn't have a ratio for the size of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16970)|
| 4:43:00| the lot, and the total of the outbuildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16980)|
| 4:43:03| So we would just ask, and it may be something you want to look into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16983)|
| 4:43:07| and come back after the month of June, but look at what is in the existing ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16987)|
| 4:43:17| And I've got a lot to do in June, so if staff is comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=16997)|
| 4:43:21| if council is willing to make the amendment to add that last column from the existing ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17001)|
| 4:43:28| to this table in the new ordinance, and that column states it's headed by maximum building coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17008)|
| 4:43:35| for any combination of buildings or structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17015)|
| 4:43:39| And the standard for each lot size is the building coverage of the primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17019)|
| 4:43:46| So all the accessory structures could not be greater than the building coverage of the primary structure, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17026)|
| 4:43:53| Just to move things along and not give me more to do in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17033)|
| 4:43:57| Finally wearing them down, but nice to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17037)|
| 4:44:03| And there's another column you might also want to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17043)|
| 4:44:06| and that has to do with the ability to get a use on review in cases where it would be warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17046)|
| 4:44:13| I would defer to, I'd give this business to Peter's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17053)|
| 4:44:18| and let them, if they need more, they can request a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17058)|
| 4:44:23| And that is just several in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17063)|
| 4:44:26| I make a, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17066)|
| 4:44:28| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17068)|
| 4:44:29| Can I make a motion that we adopt the column necessary from the chart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17069)|
| 4:44:32| I'm having deja vu right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17072)|
| 4:44:34| I swear we had this conversation already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17074)|
| 4:44:36| Oh, we probably have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17076)|
| 4:44:37| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17077)|
| 4:44:38| We just haven't gotten it changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17078)|
| 4:44:40| Which chart designates the page, I mean the one that we're changing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17080)|
| 4:44:43| It's the chart from Article 5, Section 4 in the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17083)|
| 4:44:48| C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17088)|
| 4:44:49| 4C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17089)|
| 4:44:50| C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17090)|
| 4:44:51| 4C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17091)|
| 4:44:52| Column 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17092)|
| 4:44:53| Column 4, max building coverage for any combinations of buildings or structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17093)|
| 4:44:58| If we could add that column back in, and then if there needs to be a line that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17098)|
| 4:45:03| there doesn't need to be a line for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17103)|
| 4:45:05| No, that's understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17105)|
| 4:45:08| That's a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17108)|
| 4:45:09| If it doesn't, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17109)|
| 4:45:11| They can request a variance if they want to build a giant mega center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17111)|
| 4:45:15| Use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17115)|
| 4:45:16| No, I think let's do variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17116)|
| 4:45:20| We've had both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17120)|
| 4:45:21| We've had applicants request accessory structures larger than what would be allowed on a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17121)|
| 4:45:30| What's an example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17130)|
| 4:45:31| I mean, is it an airplane hanger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17131)|
| 4:45:32| Are they storing their thresher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17132)|
| 4:45:36| Nice cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17136)|
| 4:45:38| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17138)|
| 4:45:39| Because my husband's nice car is tiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17139)|
| 4:45:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17141)|
| 4:45:42| Multiple nice cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17142)|
| 4:45:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17143)|
| 4:45:45| It's rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17145)|
| 4:45:46| Okay, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17146)|
| 4:45:47| I don't know how many people go through the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17147)|
| 4:45:51| I'm not aware of any in the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17151)|
| 4:45:54| It's rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17154)|
| 4:45:55| I'm going to make a motion that we adopt that column from the existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17155)|
| 4:45:59| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17159)|
| 4:46:00| And so your motion is basically to put in the chart that's in Article 5, Section 4C now in this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17160)|
| 4:46:08| The last column of that chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17168)|
| 4:46:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17169)|
| 4:46:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17170)|
| 4:46:11| Which says you can't exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17171)|
| 4:46:13| The size of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17173)|
| 4:46:14| The size of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17174)|
| 4:46:16| Some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17176)|
| 4:46:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17177)|
| 4:46:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17178)|
| 4:46:19| Everybody know what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17179)|
| 4:46:22| As you're finished speaking, Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17182)|
| 4:46:24| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17184)|
| 4:46:25| Just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17185)|
| 4:46:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17186)|
| 4:46:27| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17187)|
| 4:46:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17188)|
| 4:46:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17189)|
| 4:46:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17190)|
| 4:46:31| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17191)|
| 4:46:32| Anything else in 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17192)|
| 4:46:37| Councilwoman Sincerez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17197)|
| 4:46:38| Do you have something in 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17198)|
| 4:46:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17199)|
| 4:46:40| Do you have something in 10 right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17200)|
| 4:46:41| Yes, but it can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17201)|
| 4:46:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17202)|
| 4:46:43| I'm changing the subject, and I'm about to be pretty rude, but I'm getting a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17203)|
| 4:46:49| You're here representing the Community Forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17209)|
| 4:46:52| Is that correct, Ms. Malone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17212)|
| 4:46:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17214)|
| 4:46:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17215)|
| 4:46:56| So it seems to be the Community Forum and the City Council are making recode for the rest of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17216)|
| 4:47:03| Can you tell me if there's any diversity in income, in nationality, in neighborhoods in the Community Forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17223)|
| 4:47:24| Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17244)|
| 4:47:28| I'm the current chairperson of Community Forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17248)|
| 4:47:30| I've been a member since I think 2006, so I can't tell you exactly what happened in 1987 when Community Forum was founded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17250)|
| 4:47:38| But we do have members from various parts of both the city and the county and various neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17258)|
| 4:47:49| We have representatives from many neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17269)|
| 4:47:51| So I don't know how diverse you want to define diverse, but we have different age groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17271)|
| 4:47:56| Anyone make under $25,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17276)|
| 4:48:00| Making what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17280)|
| 4:48:01| Is anyone in poverty in that group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17281)|
| 4:48:04| I don't think anybody's in poverty, but I make less than $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17284)|
| 4:48:08| Well, you're retired, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17288)|
| 4:48:11| I don't get paid for what I do, put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17291)|
| 4:48:14| Neither do I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17294)|
| 4:48:15| I'm a licensed attorney, but I'm not getting paid by anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17295)|
| 4:48:18| My point is that right now this is the City Council making the decision with a very privileged group of people, mainly from West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17298)|
| 4:48:27| And not that you guys don't matter in Recode, but all the people that are missing from this decision-making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17307)|
| 4:48:35| it's really frustrating me as we talk through these things and I hear these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17315)|
| 4:48:39| I don't want my neighbor doing this, I don't want this going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17319)|
| 4:48:44| We don't speak for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17324)|
| 4:48:47| I mean, look around this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17327)|
| 4:48:49| We need a couple more opinions here, and it needs to come a little less from the community forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17329)|
| 4:48:56| and a little more from people who aren't present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17336)|
| 4:48:58| I'm all for everybody participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17338)|
| 4:49:01| We send our material out to – we've sent stuff out to every neighborhood association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17341)|
| 4:49:06| and asking them that they should participate and speak to their members and their organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17346)|
| 4:49:12| I mean, I'm all happy for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17352)|
| 4:49:14| I mean, all we can do is – I don't want to give the remarks right now that I'm going to deliver in public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17354)|
| 4:49:20| but community forum advocates for neighborhoods all over Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17360)|
| 4:49:26| And we care – we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17366)|
| 4:49:28| I mean, you may not think we do, but we care about everybody's neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17368)|
| 4:49:31| And we have people, like I said, from all over town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17371)|
| 4:49:34| Now, if you talk about income level, we probably are skewed higher than not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17374)|
| 4:49:40| but anybody can join our club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17380)|
| 4:49:43| I mean, our organization is not a closed group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17383)|
| 4:49:46| We've had members of city council attend meetings for years and county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17386)|
| 4:49:52| So, I mean, I understand your frustration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17392)|
| 4:49:55| but we've taken it upon ourselves to be engaged in this process and other processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17395)|
| 4:50:03| And like I said, we've been around since 1987.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17403)|
| 4:50:06| Mr. Silverstein, I definitely respect the amount of work you guys have all done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17406)|
| 4:50:09| and I don't think I know anybody who knows this stuff as well as Carlene does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17409)|
| 4:50:13| Me neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17413)|
| 4:50:14| And I do not mean any disrespect at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17414)|
| 4:50:16| I don't think you're trying to be exclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17416)|
| 4:50:18| I don't think you're trying to take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17418)|
| 4:50:20| I think that you come from a very caring place, and I've seen how hard you guys work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17420)|
| 4:50:25| That's not what I'm – I'm getting frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17425)|
| 4:50:28| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17428)|
| 4:50:29| I get tired early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17429)|
| 4:50:30| Me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17430)|
| 4:50:32| But it's – I'm not accusing you guys of anything at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17432)|
| 4:50:37| I'm more saying that we're not representing well when it's just a conversation between these two groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17437)|
| 4:50:43| We need to do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17443)|
| 4:50:45| And I know you've been welcoming, but sometimes that's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17445)|
| 4:50:49| Maybe we need to move this to East Knoxville or Vestal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17449)|
| 4:50:52| and have this conversation to where we have a different audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17452)|
| 4:50:55| No objection by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17455)|
| 4:50:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17457)|
| 4:50:58| All I can say is I understand your frustration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17458)|
| 4:51:02| but all I know is we have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours going through this page by page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17462)|
| 4:51:07| and when we see something that we think needs to be addressed, we address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17467)|
| 4:51:11| And, I mean, I'm not going to apologize for us participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17471)|
| 4:51:16| Everybody else in the city has the same right to do what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17476)|
