| 0:02:21| I just wanted to remind everyone of our vision and mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| Our vision statement is to grow lifelong learners who contribute their talents, strengths and skills to build a stronger community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=146)|
| 0:02:35| And our mission statement is to provide excellent and accessible learning opportunities that empower all students to realize their full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=155)|
| 0:02:44| So, thank you to this board and to our entire staff for all their efforts in working toward implementing our vision and our goals and our organizational mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=164)|
| 0:03:00| Do we have any changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| Okay, do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| We have lots of motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| Let's go with, I know I heard Mr. Watson and I think maybe Mr. McMillan seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| So, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| Okay, and I'd like to refer to Superintendent Thomas for the superintendent's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=205)|
| 0:03:32| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| I'd like to begin by adding my welcome and the welcome on behalf of our staff to you, Mrs. Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| and saying we look forward to working with you and on behalf of your district and all the students, families and employees of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=219)|
| 0:03:47| So, welcome aboard and just in time to start with budget and virus and everything else that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=227)|
| 0:03:54| So, you picked a good time to jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| I'd like to also remind everyone of an important meeting that will take place next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| The Disparities in Education Outcomes Steering Committee will host a virtual community meeting on Thursday, December 10th at 5.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=242)|
| 0:04:11| This meeting will focus on topics including academic achievement, impacts related to COVID-19 and the virtual learning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=251)|
| 0:04:19| It will be live streamed on our website, www.knoxschools.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| As board members know, eliminating disparities is one of the three goals of our strategic plan and the DEO Steering Committee plays an essential role in this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=266)|
| 0:04:34| I look forward to the meeting and hope that many of our families, students and employees will be able to watch the live stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| Finally, I'd like to point out that we're on a countdown on winter break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| So, I know everyone's excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| So, Friday, December 18th will be a half day for both in-person and virtual students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| Even with the challenges of this semester, I'm extremely proud of our students, teachers, administrators, health professionals and other staff for rising to the challenge that we've had all semester long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=292)|
| 0:05:03| Thinking back to our first day in August, I know how many of us would have not expected, I guess, our district could continue offering in-person and virtual instruction throughout the semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=303)|
| 0:05:13| But, knock on wood, we're close to getting that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| This was only possible because of the incredible efforts of our employees, the support of our families and the tremendous perseverance of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=316)|
| 0:05:24| So, I'd just like to say thank you to everyone who made this semester happen and I'm already looking forward to a great second semester which begins on Tuesday, January 5th, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=324)|
| 0:05:35| Madam Chair, members of the board, that concludes my report for this evening. So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| Thank you, Superintendent. Do we have any questions for the Superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| All right. Okay, we'll move into discussion. I'm sorry, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| Superintendent, if you could just speak a little to the current situation in our schools. I know a lot of people are concerned based on the health department's report today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=348)|
| 0:06:00| Based on the what, Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| What they heard from the health department today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| From the daily report. If you could just speak a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| In terms of the quarantine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| Well, the metrics and how we're doing as far as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| We've seen the numbers increase pretty dramatically in Knox County. Also, we're seeing numbers increase in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| As you know, the month of November has been pretty active in terms of schools that have gone red because of quarantines and positive cases and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=381)|
| 0:06:29| So, based on what the medical professionals are saying, it's probably going to get worse before it gets better and we're continuing to monitor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=389)|
| 0:06:38| I know we had a middle school and secondary school principal meeting today, virtual meetings, and heard from our principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=398)|
| 0:06:47| I know there's a lot of concern from principals about absences, about teacher absences and filling vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=407)|
| 0:06:54| A lot of concern about staff having to cover multiple classes, not getting their planned time and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=414)|
| 0:07:01| which actually puts a stress on our people and on the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| So, we've been able to maintain most of the schools all semester long, but we have seen an increase there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=427)|
| 0:07:15| I think the quarantine period, the CDC has made a recommendation or has come out with a statement saying the quarantine period could be shortened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=435)|
| 0:07:25| I know Dr. Ryswick and Jason Myers have talked to Martha Buchanan, Dr. Buchanan at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| I know our health department is, I think, supportive of that, but waiting on some guidance from the state, from the governor's office and the state health department on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=451)|
| 0:07:40| So, we may see some movement there based on the changes from the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| So, we'll continue, like I say, to monitor the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| We look at our staff absences each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| We look at our fill rates each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| We look at student absences each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| So, one factor that's not factored into that, and it's hard to quantify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| is all the additional work that teachers are having to do in order to cover classes for colleagues who are quarantined and who are absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=484)|
| 0:08:12| But, you know, we know the safest place for our students is in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| so we're trying our best to maintain that and to be in school each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| But I'll have to say it is getting much more challenging, and we're hearing that from our administrators on a pretty regular basis now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=504)|
| 0:08:33| And we want to try to do as much as we can for our teachers, try to relieve the pressure as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=513)|
| 0:08:41| I know Scott and the HR department is really working on substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| We continue to hire substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| We actually have more substitutes working now than I think we've ever had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| but, of course, the absence rate is higher, so it becomes much more difficult to fill positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| And we're looking at all of that and trying to make the best decisions that we can make for our students on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| and we'll continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| Mr. Thomas, I know that a lot of our community partners out there decided they wanted to jump in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| and try to help with virtual students to offer pods and things like that early in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| And, I mean, even the Knoxville Zoo, I think, put up a pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| I had not heard a lot in the community about folks who are trying to help mitigate the impacts for working parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| when schools are going to red for short periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| Is the school system aware of any resources in the community where people are trying to help mitigate that impact on those parents that are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| I know we've been pushing for a long time to say to parents, hey, you need a plan, right, if we go red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| But we also know that some parents don't have the option to have a good plan if they don't have access to a lot of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| So has the school system been looking into the community to say what resources are out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| And I know it's not our responsibility, but is there a way that we can help make that known to families who are trying to make that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| to say here are some of the resources you might look into accessing during those periods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| To this point, we have not done much in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| I'll certainly be glad to talk with staff and see if there's some other resources out there that we can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| I know it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| It's easy to sit here and say, hey, have a plan when the district goes red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| If I'm a working parent, single parent, or even two working parents, guardians, whatever, I've got to go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| I don't get paid if I don't go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| So I know that's a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| But we'll look at that a little bit closer and see if there are some ways that we can offer some help to families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| And I'm not even suggesting that it's KCS that's doing the helping other than becoming aware of what resources might be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=644)|
| 0:10:51| I mean, I know the Shore Foundation and the zoo and others, again, talked about helping for those students who have decided to go virtual the whole semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=651)|
| 0:10:59| I've not necessarily heard a lot of people saying here's a solution for those kids who are doing something intermittent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| But it may be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| And I just don't know if it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| And then we'll, you know, I think anybody watching, tell your friends if they need a job, we need substitute teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=671)|
| 0:11:19| So we have people in our community who are unemployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| And so if they are qualified and would be a good addition to our team, we do have some openings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=682)|
| 0:11:32| And also as I know Dr. Buchanan is probably just digesting the information and waiting on more guidance from the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=692)|
| 0:11:41| So perhaps we, you know, we can follow up with her and perhaps see if she can be here next week to chat with us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=701)|
| 0:11:49| So we will check into that since we do actually have some movement and some change based on quarantining protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=709)|
| 0:12:00| So I'll follow up on that on behalf of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Any questions on items one or two, contracts, items in contracts one or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=726)|
| 0:12:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Three or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| I have a question on item C3, the online subscription agreement with DBQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| Is this something new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| Is this something our teachers have already been trained to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| Or is this something that they will need to be trained to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| Ms. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| This is a resource our teachers already have in print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| This just gives us the opportunity to have digital integration so that the teachers can use a digital version of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| And the date is October 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| Is this, are we doing this retroactively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| We have not sent it out to the teachers or received the product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| We did not realize that there was going to be another contract coming with this, so we had to press pause until we could get board approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| So should we change the date on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| It says it also expires October 1st, so I wouldn't want it to expire earlier than it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| Is that, are we able to change the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| I'd have to defer to the law department on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| We can change dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| You know, the board can certainly approve a contract for, you know, a year term, say starting, you know, spring semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=821)|
| 0:13:51| The only problem with that might come in crossing fiscal years, and I'd have to defer to Mr. McPherson on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=831)|
| 0:14:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| I'm not hugely worried about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| I just didn't want it to run out if we're going to pay for a year contract for it to run out two months early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| I will look into it and make sure I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Any questions on four or five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| Okay, item six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| Okay, moving into board policies, any questions on policy I-381, second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=865)|
| 0:14:33| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| If I could ask Dr. Roswick to clarify for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| In looking at this policy, what we are doing is basically holding harmless for EOC scores in student grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=880)|
| 0:14:50| but it still has listed the 10 percent for grades six through eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| and so I just want to clarify that that's legislative, if you could talk about that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| Yes, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| So there are two different bodies that have the rules for that, and you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| The General Assembly sets the law for 3.8, which is the TCAP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| and I think they meet again in January and will potentially take that up then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| So the board voted two years ago, three years ago, to use the minimum for those to count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| so the 6.8 that you're referring to, that is the 10 percent, would have to be a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| That's the minimum that's currently allowed by the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| If they change that and set that, if they follow what the state board did for high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| then they would give the local LEAs the ability to move that down to zero before the test would happen in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| The portion of this one, the high school EOC, that's controlled actually by the Tennessee State Board of Ed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| and they have, it originally was 15 to 25 percent, and November 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| that's when they passed the leasing of LEAs, the ability to move that down to zero percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| which the first reading went through on that, and we'll, if it goes through next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| we'll have that down to zero so they won't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| They'll be held harmless and won't count against them in their final grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| That may have been more than you wanted, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| We're passing the part that we are able to now, and we are waiting for the legislature so we can do something more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Yeah, we can't affect the lower grades until they make a move from the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| I don't think I was going to speak at all in my first meeting, but here I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| So to my understanding that the students will be held harmless at zero percent for their EOCs, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| But my concern is the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| Will the state still hold the schools accountable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| I just don't want that to hurt our teachers or our schools, and will they still use it for the state report card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| So that's a great question, and there's lots of parts to it, so let me see if I can try to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| So the state, in order for them to – okay, so a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| So there's a couple pieces that the assessment is currently used in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| So one is for the student grade, and so the state board controlled that, gave it back to the local boards to make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| We're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| So maybe I can use this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| We're in the middle of the testing window right now, and so some people started EOCs earlier in the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| and so I know I've received a few emails about saying, why wasn't this taken care of kind of before then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| And really, it's about the timing of when the state board made the move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| They didn't make the move until November 6th, which meant it couldn't come before this board until the November 1st reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| and then second reading is this one coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| So what we're trying to be clear to families is that even if your student's taking the EOC now, it won't have a negative impact on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1054)|
| 0:17:42| And we have virtual students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| There's a whole lot of other things with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| So your question really was on what does that do for state accountability or district accountability and school accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| Those are actually part of the plan that goes to the state that the state sends to the feds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| So the federal law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, the ESSA Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| they have to move at a federal level to say that states aren't responsible for their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| So there's like a lot of pieces to that part on how that accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| So our state put together, here's how we want to hold schools and districts accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| and the feds approve that in order to get federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| So they would take some action at the federal level to give states that break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| and the governor or the commissioner could ask the feds to waive that for the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| and that's what happened last year in the middle of that, and so they pretty much gave waive across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| The other piece of that is the teacher evaluation part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| and that's the one that we think that we've been told, and through conversations with commissioner's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| and the governor's office, the General Assembly will take up in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| and feel pretty confident that they'll be able to give that a pass for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| So that part of the student accountability that leads into that will be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| All right, moving on to policy J201. Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| Thank you, Madam Chair. Two clarifying questions, and the first one will go to Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| Could you just give us some information as to why this policy exists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| Is it a mandatory policy, or is it just a policy within KCS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| Sorry, I was trying to get my computer to go here. It's kind of slow tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1161)|
| 0:19:28| So we're talking about J201, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Okay. So J201 came about several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| I believe Mr. Oaks had talked about this at the board's last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| that it came up in response to some school shootings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| and specifically was passed in Knox County schools due to the situation at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1190)|
| 0:20:00| So your question is, is this a mandatory policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| The response would be no, it's not a mandatory policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| It is one that was passed to look out for the best interest of all students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| was my understanding and still my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| It does have to have, and again I think Mr. Oaks talked about this last time too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| it has to have some type of measurements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| some type of either in the community or in the schools themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| as far as an elevated nature of crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| And here it specifically talks about weapons and drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| So when we're talking about crime, we're talking about those two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Does that answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Yes. I just kind of wanted to bring that knowledge to the public room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| because I know it was in the policy review, but I wanted to bring it here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| And then my second question will be a clarifying question for you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| In line 25, the director of schools shall develop administrative procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1269)|
| 0:21:16| so that random school student searches are not targeted to individual groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| class, race, gender, school, or geographical areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| What are some of those procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| and what's your procedure to make sure that that doesn't happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Senator Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| Let me just kind of go through the steps for you there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| and hopefully that will answer the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| And if you've got further questions, we'll try to answer those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| But first of all, it's scheduled through the principal of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| and the search does not happen unless the superintendent approves the search for the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1305)|
| 0:21:52| So there are four to seven officers that conduct the random search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| Those are officers that are not at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| And we try to do a random search at least one time for each high school and middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| So that ensures that all high schools and middle schools would have at least one search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1324)|
| 0:22:11| It's conducted prior to school. It's videotaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| Those videotapes are archived, so if there's a question that comes up about the search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| then we can go back to the archives to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| Again, the school's resource officer at that school does not participate in the search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| And it's based on the student volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| The larger the number of students, the increase in the randomness of the search, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| Just for example, it could be the sergeant in charge of the search would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| we're going to search every fourth, sixth, tenth, fifteenth student or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| And again, the larger the number, the number of students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| the fewer searches that would be conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| As the students are selected, they're wanded with a handheld magnetometer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| They're asked to empty pockets and backpacks are searched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| And the entire search takes about 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| So again, the randomness is going to be from the standpoint that the sergeant chooses a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| that would search the students that come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| So that helps to ensure the randomness of the search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| And again, I think if there's ever a question about it, like I say, those videotapes are archived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| and we can go back and look at a specific search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| And I think in the number of years we've been doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| I think there has been one occasion that we had to go back and look at a particular search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1408)|
| 0:23:36| and whatever the accusation there was was unfounded based on that videotape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| So it's been a relatively smooth process that we've done over the last number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| So I don't know if you have more specific questions or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| No, that was perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| I just really wanted to know the why and how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Yes, I've got a question related to lines 37 through 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| That from my understanding of the law, Mr. Dupler, in order for us to approve a policy like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| there has to be cause within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| And so those lines obviously speak to that cause where it says that there's a significant increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| in the use of firearms in the commission of crimes as stated by local law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| in the greater community and continuing discovery of controlled substances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| So for me, what I want to be insured of as a board member acting in good faith is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| I don't just believe that to be true, but I know that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| And so if we can speak to what is happening right now in our community that says this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| that we need to have in place, that would be fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| Chief Producers, would you like to come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Well, I will tell you when we make decisions about crime and the perception of crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| there's really three areas that we focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| Number one is just the communication with our law enforcement partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| and all the different ways that you can communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| And, of course, we pay attention to what they tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| We also pay attention to what is released publicly, provided it's from reputable sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| And probably within the last three or four weeks, KPD released some information publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| that said the homicide rate for 2020 was going to exceed the individual totals for the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1520)|
| 0:25:30| And so I will tell you in 2018, KPD had 20 homicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| In 2019, they had 21 homicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| And so far through the end of November of this year, they've had 31 homicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| And so you look at what you're getting from your law enforcement partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| and then you're looking at the facts, and the facts are always helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| But probably the most telling piece is the perception of our principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| the perception of our school community, and fear and the perception of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| I know within the last two months, I have had conversation with three different principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| that have called us and asked for extra security because of unrest that was happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| among their school community or the community in which their school sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| As many of you will know, we've had several of our students that have either been shot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1583)|
| 0:26:30| in the last 60, 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| We've had several of our students that have been at least accused of being the shooter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| some as young as 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| And so we know the homicide rate is up inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| And I'm not picking at schools inside the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| but that's the data that I've been able to gather the last day or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| And then also if you dig a little deeper into the statistical number on the crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| particularly as it relates to violence, aggravated assaults are going to be up in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| Simple assaults are going to be up in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| The data that we collect from our schools about assaults and fights are going to be up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1630)|
| 0:27:19| And, of course, part of the focus of the rewording, if you will, of this particular policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| particularly as it relates to drug paraphernalia, is the focus on the vaping issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| And we know that's a huge issue, and the district has spent considerably resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| on trying to get a handle on the vaping issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| And last year our numbers, and we don't have a lot of historical data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| because we just started focusing last year on the specifics of vaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| but we had 166 reports of vaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| And so far this year, keeping in mind we've got a late start to the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| only two-thirds of our kids are attending school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| we're at about 59 reports in which children have been involved in vaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| So certainly the numbers would tell us that we've had a violent year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| And again, I think most importantly, the perception of many folks in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| is that right now, as wonderful a community as we have in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| it has become a little bit more dangerous than it has been in years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| And we know anything that happens in the community touches a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| And so we're very sensitive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| Thank you, Chief. Anything else, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| No, Chief Petouces, thank you so much for digging into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| And I know you had limited time to ascertain some of that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| but if there's a way to access some of that information for the county as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| I think the board would appreciate that since this is a county-wide policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| Yes, sir. We have a request into the Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| and so we will try to gather that information, certainly before next Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| Thank you. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Thank you. Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| Okay. Moving on to grants, any questions on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| Mr. Watson, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| Okay. C or D? Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1760)|
| 0:29:29| I actually have a question on A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Looking at the amount of this grant that is for other supplies and materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| could we have some clarification on what those other supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| and materials might entail for the Safe Schools grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| Ms. Cook is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Thank you, Ms. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1796)|
| 0:30:14| Looking at the $700,000, so we have $321,000 that is for glass-resistant windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1814)|
| 0:30:26| and doors, which $250,000 of that was from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| We had a contract that we put out to bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| and there were some problems with it getting it fulfilled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| and so it's carried on actually from last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| so that was part of the carryover money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| Looking at what security is doing for this year to support security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| we're looking at $200,000 on directional signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| So that's a big chunk of money for our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| plus we also have to provide some for our charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| The rest of the money is capturing kids' hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| We're looking at that program for $21,000 and $30,000 for YTRI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| and then $15,500 for Project U.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| So those are the schools, the Project U programs within the middle and high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1878)|
| 0:31:25| And then we have Chromebooks for our security officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| because a lot of the work that they do, the threat assessments and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| are online now, so we have Chromebooks for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| and then we have some laptops for our restorative learning behavioral liaison staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| Then we have $10,000 for some adjustments to our bullying workflow, which is in Aspen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1903)|
| 0:31:55| So we've had them go back in and work in Aspen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| so that we make sure that we're in compliance with all the laws for bullying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| And the last thing is we have $35,000 for school culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| just supplies and purchases for a variety of software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| some security supplies, social skills programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| We haven't really defined that at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| but as we go through the year, we'll see what we need to use that money for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Thank you, Ms. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| Ms. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Just related to the Project U program that you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| is that the one that got started at Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| And how many of our high schools and middle schools is that in now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| It's in all the high schools and middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| It's in all of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| I have a question for Mr. McPherson related to the matching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| I think you're probably the best qualified here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| I think it would be good for the board to understand how in both A and C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| how those grants get matched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1979)|
| 0:33:06| Well, I would actually need to look at the backup on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| Typically when we have a match, it's either an in-kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| or it's from the general purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| So I may have to defer on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| I mean, I know the answer I called and asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| but I think it would be good for the board to know at all that in grant A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| that's fully matched by in-kind services provided directly from those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| departments where we're not paying for their services in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| But then in C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| it's actually a ratio where we're funding that percentage out of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| budget and then the grant is taking up the rest of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| that it's actual dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| Ms. Cook, did you want to add anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| I was just going to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| so from the matching for the sheriff's department and the KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| so it's about $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Their salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Any questions on grant C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2052)|
| 0:34:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2064)|
| 0:34:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| This, Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| would you like to weigh in on E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| because this is one that you have not signed off on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| Or is that a down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| I was just trying to pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| My computer is awful slow tonight for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| It may be affected by COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| but what happened on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| so there's a lot of, no, I won't say a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| but there's usually two situations when the law department won't sign off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| on a contract for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| One falls in this category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| or this contract falls in the first category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| which is it's one that's not preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| it doesn't have the terms that we expect to be in a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| in a contract that's going to work the best for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| That usually means, well, it may be a choice of law that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| a jurisdiction that we don't go to or have a license to practice in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2145)|
| 0:35:53| It could be that the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| there's an identification provision that we simply can't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| comply with for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| So it's one that the board can still go forward with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| but when we don't sign off on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| I think what we're saying there is proceed with caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| Beware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| Then there's also the other category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| which is where we feel that a contract is simply, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| a contract or an agreement or whatever it is, is simply illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| I mean, there's just no way for the board to go forward legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| So, again, this one falls in the first category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| I believe when I reviewed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| had some concerns about the fact that the board would be locked in to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2198)|
| 0:36:47| using Rosetta Stone and it was going to be ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| Do you have my notes as well, Terry, or is that not in the board office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| I think that's the question that I had was whether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| and maybe Mr. Reisel could be the better one to discuss that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| but whether this would obligate us to further purchases or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| Dr. Reisel, do you have any information on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| Well, and I'll let Dr. Reisel go ahead and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| But, I mean, I'm kind of recalling it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| I mean, so what happens is when you start using Rosetta Stone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| Rosetta Stone has a completely separate set of documents that are all online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| that are then brought into this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| So you don't even see all the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| So, I mean, Rosetta Stone has its own privacy policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| and it has its own terms and conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| And certainly those terms and conditions had some of the things that I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| Different jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| Confidentiality probably wasn't a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| I mean, again, I'm just trying to go by memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| but I'm sure indemnification was a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| Arbitration was a problem and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Dr. Reisel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| So that's my recollection too, Mr. DuPort, as we talked through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| So what's in the grant itself is Westview would receive a $5,000 to use to support their ELL students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2288)|
| 0:38:17| which they're working with Enid Slusher, our ELL supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| to build that out and to have some curriculum options for the ELL students there at Westview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| But another part of that grant is they do receive a year of Rosetta Stone that's valued at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| it sounds like a game show, but it's valued at $12,500 for them to have access to that for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2311)|
| 0:38:38| And then our understanding is if they chose to use their dollars to re-up that, they could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| but they get one year's kind of free use of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| And I think, again, as Mr. DuPort said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| that kind of secondary contract was the one and the language in it to use Rosetta Stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| But there's no obligation to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| It just gives them a year to be able to do that and also get the $5,000 grant to support their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| Any, Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| Yes, and thank you for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| I just want to see if there's any other reservations from board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| because then that will be a conversation with the principal to see what other platforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| that they possibly can use or opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| Because I know we can pass it as a board, but if there's, if it won't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| then I'd like to know so we can prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| I guess I'm a little confused in looking at the contract because it seems that it's a grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| but then when we open the documentation, we're looking at an educator of the year contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| So how does this all work together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2379)|
| 0:39:55| Dr. Isaac, would you have any information on that piece of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2395)|
| 0:40:04| So, thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| My understanding is that this was an application for the teacher to apply for those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2406)|
| 0:40:13| I think you're correct that it was a teacher of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| I think we received up to a $7,500 one for their school, for their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| And I think in this case the teacher was a runner-up or that second tier for $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| and that was part of the grant that was being rewarded, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| grant being awarded to them to use for their students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| as well as they got the full year to use Rosetta Stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| So when they applied for the grant, did our grants office, did it go through our grants office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| Did it go through us at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| Looks like on this one I'd have to double check to make sure that, yeah, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| Our grant coordinator has signed off on it as well, our grant supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| So it says here that each runner-up would receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| each runner-up prize would consist of a $5,000 grant awarded in the form of a check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| made payable to the winner educator's school of employment intended to be used for the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| for enhancing their ELL programming and also the Rosetta Stone program for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| So I think they applied with the grant for that in that teacher's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| And being a runner-up, those were the two things that were awarded for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| It did go through our grant office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| If I understand correctly, the teacher applied for a grant with the approval of our grant office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| It was signed off on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| The teacher won the second-place grant, and so now we are approving the acceptance of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| So she would not get that grant if we don't approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| And that's exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| So the grant office works in both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| Sometimes they find grants that make sense for schools, that would fit that description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| and then there are other times when a teacher or a student or a school or a teacher may reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| I can't talk tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| And this was a case where I think it was the teacher who did it and reached out to our grant department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| Mr. Doobler, do you want to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| Go ahead, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| You might answer my questions, Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Well, and I was just going to offer some further clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| Oftentimes what falls into Category 1 are grants because, I mean, even grants from Walmart, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2530)|
| 0:42:19| have provisions in them that choice of law and things like that that are not preferred terms for the school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2539)|
| 0:42:28| But our office takes the position, okay, you know, this is a grant, and if it's used for the intended purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2548)|
| 0:42:37| if it's used according to the terms of the agreement, then you can take it or leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| I mean, you can go ahead and take it on those terms, but if something goes wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| the teacher or the principal or the school just has to realize, hey, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| we may just have to call it off at this point, I mean, if everything goes wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| But fortunately that doesn't happen very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| And, you know, like I said, this board has approved numerous grants similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| Like I said, I think Walmart's a prime example, but they're not the only ones that the board would say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| let's go forward with the understanding that this is what it is type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Mr. Watson, did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| So, okay, any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| So, Ms. Tatterfield, to answer your question, I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| I just wanted to make sure that the board knows that Mr. Dupler had not signed off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| And I wanted to make sure we weren't obligated to any other purchases or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| So, congratulations to this teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Any questions on F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| Moving to contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| Questions on A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| I have a question on B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| So, I think, I could be wrong, I didn't count, but I think this was the most pages of documentation that we had of any other line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| And the only thing that I was curious about in that is the $1.2 million, is that for the total five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2648)|
| 0:44:16| or is that just per year potentially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| And then the other question is, I know this is representing three different companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| how many printers are we talking about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Mr. McPherson, would you like to come and speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| It was a tremendous amount of documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| I had to get the exact number on the printers there because there's different types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| And this is district wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| So, the $1.2 million, that's for an annual cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| So, it was time to re-bid this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| And so, it went through procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| It was evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| There were several different evaluators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| And these were the winning vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| And what was very attractive to us is that it looks like we're projecting actually a savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| a reduction in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| We don't get that quite often, but it's about $175,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| But I'll get a total number of the number of printers that this would affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| But it involves different types and the different ones in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| We'll get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| I think whenever the public sees $1.2 million for printers, they're like, whoa, is that for like two printers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| And it's district wide, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| So, we're talking about all the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| And so, we'll obviously, when we exchange those printers, folks from the business office will go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| and then they'll help get those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| Train the folks and offer some support there because anytime you change something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Questions on C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| And then moving to, we just have one regular agenda item, the legislative priorities for 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| And so, basically, we took last year's priorities and let me just pull this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2759)|
| 0:46:08| I know I asked Mr. McPherson to give us some language on holding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2768)|
| 0:46:16| what we would want to say regarding holding districts harmless regarding the EP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| since that's a concern for going into the next budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| So, that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| And then Ms. Owen updated some language on the teacher performance evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2786)|
| 0:46:34| I think that was the bulk of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| And otherwise, other than I think those two things, it's very similar to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| There were just some minor grammatical changes in addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| Ms. Owen, would you like to speak to the teacher performance evaluation piece of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| The part that I added is just the last three sentences from where it says teacher evaluation scores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| should be decoupled from student testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| And, really, that's based on all these past years of not having scores in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| This is also something that is a legislative priority for TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2830)|
| 0:47:17| So, I just tried to put that language in there to best show what we really meant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2837)|
| 0:47:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| Do we ever get responses when we send this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| I've had some discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| Typically, we do meet with our legislative delegation in January before they go back into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| And we tend to have the same conversation every January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| So, we'll plan to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| And so, this would be a guide for that conversation and a guide for as legislation comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2875)|
| 0:48:04| I think part of the purpose of this would be so that you can really speak on behalf of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2884)|
| 0:48:13| if the board has approved this versus just an individual board member advocating for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| if our board has approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| If we don't approve this, then you could not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| Do you think that's accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| What I found very helpful, we know that there are some legislators who have very strong opinions on some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2909)|
| 0:48:37| And sometimes with those legislators, I just dropped off a copy for them to have at their leisure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2917)|
| 0:48:47| Lots of new legislators, this was very good to have to open a conversation about where we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| because their boards back home were telling them the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| So, it was useful, I think, for that conversation with new legislators especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2937)|
| 0:49:04| so that they could see where school boards across the state were looking at the same concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2944)|
| 0:49:13| Yes, very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| So, we do need to, I'm assuming the board would be open to trying to get together with our legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2956)|
| 0:49:27| before they go into session for 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| Would you guys be willing to do that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| So, we'll work on getting a date on the calendar for hopefully the first week in January or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2973)|
| 0:49:41| first or second week in January, so that we can just touch base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| And we do have some new delegates and new legislators that we can meet with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2985)|
| 0:49:52| And so, this could frame some of that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| So, any other questions on or comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| And do we have anyone for public forums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| Madam Chair, we have no one for public forum tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| Okay, so we'll move to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| Any comments for board forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| I know we've received some updates on the budget and there was an article recently that our state tax is doing really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3021)|
| 0:50:28| And so, I was wondering if we could add to the agenda a discussion on where we are with our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3028)|
| 0:50:36| and when or if we could afford to reinstate the 4% salary increases that we promised teachers in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| I know understandably that got tabled for the time being, but I know that our budget, I think, is doing better than we projected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| So, I was wondering, can we add that to the agenda or how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| We can look at probably adding that for January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| I'm not sure if we would want to add that for next week unless the board would want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| That's for short notice for the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| But we can definitely, yeah, we can look at that for January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| Does that sound agreeable, gentlemen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| Mr. Superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| Would you prefer to look at that in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| That would probably be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| That would give us a chance to get one more data point, I think, for December sales taxes, which would probably be around the 18th or the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3083)|
| 0:51:31| Yeah, we would have a little more information by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| Well, I say December, but that's, of course, two months prior to December, but it's one more data point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| For October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| I would agree with Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| I will remind the board that Monday there is a joint education committee meeting with the board and the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3100)|
| 0:51:48| and there is an item on there specifically in reference to budget updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| So, we're also going to give an update based on what we know after three data points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| But I think Mr. Thomas is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| The more we can get under our belt, then the better information that we will have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| But, anyway, just a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| Don't run off there, Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| That's what he told me in the second grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| I know everybody would like to give four percent, and maybe we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| But we talked a little bit, I think it was last month or maybe the month before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3152)|
| 0:52:39| about how the sales tax is just knocking it out of the park compared to what expectations had been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3159)|
| 0:52:53| But we don't have any assurance that at some point all good things come to an end, as they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3173)|
| 0:53:02| But we might be able to look at a bonus, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3182)|
| 0:53:13| We are still looking at all the different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| I can say that through three data points, and when I say that I mean through September, July, August, and September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3198)|
| 0:53:27| so through the first quarter, we're running about 14 percent over budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| We are about seven percent more than actual collections from the prior year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| although I will add that the prior year through September did not include the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3218)|
| 0:53:46| The law went into effect about the Internet sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| I think we get a better comparison beginning in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| When I say October, keep in mind we run two months behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| It takes about two months before it lands in the coffers so we can look at the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3238)|
| 0:54:04| So yes, sales tax is significantly better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| Economists are also predicting a strong Christmas retail spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3250)|
| 0:54:20| So that, I think, is in our favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| The struggle that we're having right now is with an eye towards next year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3263)|
| 0:54:30| because, keep in mind, there's a considerable amount of items that we actually pull back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3270)|
| 0:54:40| There were some unmet needs, departmental needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| We'll need to take a look at those again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| There are some what we called reallocations where we did some creative budgetary programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3285)|
| 0:54:56| with some items that we could fund through grants, like Title I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| that will not be available to us this year or the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| There are some things that we cut, and so we will need to look at is there any room to restore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3306)|
| 0:55:15| Obviously, salary increases always rise to the top of the things that we want to look at first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3315)|
| 0:55:22| One-to-one initiative, I'm just doing this off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| We funded largely early on in Phase I for the device costs through federal dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| through the CARES Act primarily, and through the Remote Learning Grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| which is also federal dollars come through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| At some point, we'll have to look at how we can strategically program that into our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| because that's a recurring cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| So I will say that, yes, it's very encouraging how the revenue looks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3345)|
| 0:55:52| but I would guard all of us to not look at this as if it's some sort of a windfall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3352)|
| 0:55:59| because there are a considerable number of needs that we will have to grapple with in next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3359)|
| 0:56:06| So we're looking at a lot of things, but as Mr. Thomas said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| the more data you can get under your belt, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| I will say this, that in July, when the first data point came in, which would have been September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3376)|
| 0:56:25| it was significantly higher, sales tax-wise, than what we had projected and budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3385)|
| 0:56:32| It was like $32 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| We didn't rely on that number a lot because it was just one data point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| There's a lot that can happen after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| So the more data you get in, the more reliable the numbers become, usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| So for August, when those numbers were posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| which is the last number that we shared with the board, was about $23 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| And when I say $23 million, I'm saying by the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| this is what the trend data would suggest where the numbers would land, $23 million surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| So just this week, we got more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| We ran the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| In fact, we were just trying to finalize some of this just this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| And so we were going to send this information to the board once we got it finalized within the end of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3436)|
| 0:57:23| But I'm speaking off the top of my head right now where I think the numbers landed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| It's down to about $22 million surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| So what I'm saying is that the more data points we get, while the news is still encouraging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3449)|
| 0:57:37| it's actually reducing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| So the thing we have to understand is if it continues to reduce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| while I still expect there to be surplus at the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| barring some unforeseen circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3465)|
| 0:57:52| it's still good news, but the good news is not as good as it was a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3472)|
| 0:57:59| I'm just saying that because I think we have to be really cautious about how we approach going forward throughout the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3479)|
| 0:58:07| and with and out towards next year's budget debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| You said it well, and that was the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| I'm not against us giving a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| But the only reason I even mentioned a bonus is a raise has to be factored in from now on and every time we do a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3499)|
| 0:58:33| A bonus does not, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| But along the lines of what you were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| I'm not really too concerned about through the end of this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3523)|
| 0:58:52| It's about February and March that I think we may see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3532)|
| 0:59:00| When it drops, it may come down almost as quickly as it shot up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| I know I can't predict that, but I do think you have to at least stop and think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3546)|
| 0:59:16| It depends on what's going on nationally and at state level and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3556)|
| 0:59:24| But I just want to point out and make sure that everybody on the board understood about this reoccurring deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3564)|
| 0:59:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| Once we lock in on something like that, we have to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| We're committed from then on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| Right. And you and I talked about some of these other reoccurring things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| And I'm glad you mentioned that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| One question. When the internet sales tax, when was it added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| When was the first month that it was added in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| I believe it was October of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| Okay. So we'll get to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| So later on this month, we should have October's numbers for this year, which will be a pretty good comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| Because we're looking at apples and apples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| Gotcha. And so the trend, does it take that into account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| Okay. All right. So next, we'll look to do that in January and have a comprehensive update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3616)|
| 1:00:23| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| Anything else from the board? Okay. We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3625)|
| 1:00:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201202?start=3633)|
