| 0:05:38| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Do I have a remote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=339)|

| 0:05:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| So a couple of agenda items here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| I'm just going to give you some updates on some of the things we've heard from the community in our first round of public engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| You all have already heard a little bit about this, but just wanted to provide some of the overarching takeaways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| since we've had a chance to actually dig into some of that feedback a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| as well as taking a look at some of the next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| We have a few big items that are underway and coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Our process, as you all have probably seen this before, we actually underwent our first phase of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| which we called our State of the County Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| and then that was accompanied by our first phase of public input as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| That actually concluded in the spring and very early portion of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| That actually concluded in the spring and very early portion of the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| with the release of our State of the County report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| From that point, we entered into the second phase of our process, which is the scenario planning effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| and I'll talk about that a little bit more here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| As we go through this process, at the conclusion of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| we anticipate having a second round of public engagement as we go into the early fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| Then from there, as a reminder, we will migrate into the preparation of our draft plan recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| and that will also be accompanied by a third phase of public engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| so making sure that we have those touch points that correlate with the major milestones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| that we are achieving through our plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| I did want to highlight a couple of things on our community feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| As I mentioned at a previous county commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| you all had the opportunity to hear a little bit about this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| and some of the activities that were undertaken as a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| But just to look at this from kind of the key takeaways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| this was our ideas week with a first phase, again, really oriented to gaining perspectives, feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=467)|
| 0:07:55| understanding what was on folks' minds across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| And this was a great chance for us to reach out to folks in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| as well as connecting with people online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| making sure that we were asking similar questions in each venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| so that we could actually combine what we heard both in person and online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| and use those two things in tandem with each other to help provide important points of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| going into the next phases of our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| So I think something that I really wanted to highlight with you all today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| are the common themes that emerged from this outreach process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| So we had the opportunity to look at all of the questions that were asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| and some of the feedback that we received from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| and from there begin to understand the major themes that emerged from these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| And we framed these around a few different categories, I guess, or characterizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| one being what folks consider the treasures to be within our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| Thinking about the natural environment was something that came to mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| for our respondents and participants, as well as the rural, small-town character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| that is present within the unincorporated county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| as well as the people of the county themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| That was a very frequent response that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| as well as the amenities and culture that is present within our unincorporated county area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| Thinking about our places, so from the land-use side of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| some of the common themes that we heard were the maintenance improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| and expansion of parks, connectivity, walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| thinking about new types of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| but also embracing that rural character that is present within the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| and creating and respecting a plan for managing growth within the unincorporated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=583)|
| 0:09:50| From a transportation perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| we heard things running the gamut from improving our roads and intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| to understanding bicycle and pedestrian connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| thinking about transit options within the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| and then also safety, enhancing our safety and improving our traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| And then we asked folks to even think outside the box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| what things might go beyond those characterizations of land-use and transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| and that's where we started to see things like growing that Parks and Greenway Network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| considering how schools play an important role in all of these different topics that we've discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| protecting the environment, and also improving our housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| So it's so critical for us to receive this quality feedback that we did receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| because these are going to play important roles for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| in all of the forthcoming phases of our planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| So in addition to some of these overarching ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| we did have a chance to dig into some particular location-based ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| that people were willing to share with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| From this process, we actually had 538 unique mapped ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| running, again, that spectrum of land-use, transportation, or other connecting ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=664)|
| 0:11:12| And so this was a great place for us to dig in and understand those particular areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| where folks may want to see improvements, emphasis-placed areas of focus that we want to dig into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| So again, this is going to be a helpful tool for us moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| So again, where we're going at this point is thinking about those community values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| that we're able to take away from the identification of trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| and moving toward the development of vision and goals for Advanced NOx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| And this is an important step in our process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| because the vision and goals that we establish are going to be instrumental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| in helping us understand how we need to develop our land-use and transportation recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=714)|
| 0:12:01| And as I'll mention here in just a moment, we actually have a series of committee meetings tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| and one of the primary topics that we'll be discussing with our committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| are the introduction to our vision and goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| and helping them see the tie-back to what we heard in terms of those themes from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| so that we can see some of that direct linkage that was established there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| So more to come on the vision and goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| but we did want you to understand that that's part of how we directly apply the feedback that we've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| and kind of take that next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| So I mentioned our committee meetings that are upcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| They're actually going to be held tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| That's the Cancelor YMCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| We're meeting with all of our committees tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| so that is inclusive of our schools and utilities subcommittee groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| as well as our technical committee and our advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| We're going to be spending a lot of our time on the vision and goals discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| as well as starting to talk more about our scenario planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| So speaking of scenario planning, this is something that we are, as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| really knee-deep in on the development of this current phase of our planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| And scenario planning is an important step in the overall development of our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| because this essentially helps us identify and study questions that we might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| that we want answered as a part of our recommendations development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| And it's going to ultimately help us make better decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| as we get into that recommendations formation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| So by testing a variety of different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| we kind of help to arrive at something that's going to be the best fit for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| So that's what we're actually embarking on right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| and we're going to have some discussions about several of the elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| of the scenario planning process with our committees tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| So a couple of the things that are also upcoming include the communication of our results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| Once we develop our initial scenarios, we'll actually be communicating those outward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| and that will come as part of our second phase of public engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| And that's where we actually let folks see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| here are some of the questions we wanted answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| so here's how we actually tested some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| So are we giving folks this is the answer right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| No, we're not, but this gives us pieces of information that people can react to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| They can tell us what they like, what they'd like to see more of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| what they'd maybe like to see less of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| From all of that, we can actually arrive at what we would call our preferred scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| which will ultimately direct the land use and transportation recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| that are a part of Advanced NOx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| And that will come as a part of our community engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| which, again, is being targeted in early fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| And I should note that as a part of our process that we've done up to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| and actually is still ongoing, we have our committee members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| that we're reaching out with and engaging periodically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| but also a series of stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| We've actually had around 20 unique connections with key stakeholders across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| that can give us insight into development landscape, our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| certain things about our utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| those topics that we need to dig into a little bit more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| and understand those pieces of information that are going to help guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| the decision-making process as part of Advanced NOx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| So all of those things are ultimately just pieces in our toolkit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| that are going to help us arrive at the best answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| So next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| I think that was actually my last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Well, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| I appreciate the opportunity to present to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| and I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| I know Vice Chairman Biggs has had his light on for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| Commissioner Jay's light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Any other commissioners have any questions, please turn your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| But thank you for that presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| That was tremendously informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| Vice Chairman Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| On page five it says expand transit options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| A little bit more in depth, I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| The reason is because the workforce travel has become an issue in specific areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| especially industrial parks that are located out in the county with no public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| So you have to look to things like CIC, other means and how we can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| Is that built into that component?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| Will we have something that states how we plan to put some relief on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| Is that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| That is one of the things that we are looking at, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| To kind of understand what level of transit is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| where are some of those key destination points that may need to be best served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| and then what agencies are the right partners to be a part of that initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| I've been meeting a lot with the Chamber lately, with Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| He's actually right behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| We've been talking about out at Forks of the River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| you know you've got three major, major businesses that provide thousands of jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| and just having something like that could benefit them right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| whenever they're having a time of filling the void of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| So I'm sure you are with multiple people looking into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| but I'm excited to see what you guys come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| I want to see how that gets plugged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| Is this update available online somewhere where the public can access it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| or is this just for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| Besides our agenda, is it on the main website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| To me, this is one of our biggest projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| If you could give us the address of the main Advance Knox website again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| so the public knows about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| Is it just AdvanceKnox.org?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| AdvanceKnox.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| If you wouldn't mind to add this to just as you give us briefings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| It gives us an opportunity to share that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| and also continue to point people back to that resource if they want more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Yes, we'll post that online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| I apologize, I was looking in the wrong direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| so I don't know if Commissioner Bussler or Commissioner Hill was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| Would either of you like to defer to the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| A question on this community feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| I was noticing this is in-person participation and online participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| Now, on this, is that the total number that you've had to do the surveys or talk to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| this number that you've got here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| From the first phase of engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| those were the total numbers of our in-person connections and our online survey respondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| Do you have any kind of demographics of what these people were made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| where they're from and what their backgrounds and some of those things are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| We do have some of that demographic breakdown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| and it's part of our online, or I'm sorry, our outreach summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| and that's actually posted to our advancednox.org as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| Seeing these numbers here and as large as this county is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| what would you expect would be a good number to draw your information from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| I think that's a challenging question to identify a particular number of respondents for this type of a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1181)|
| 0:19:49| I think that what we attempt to do as a part of each one of these engagement rounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| is make sure that our opportunities are geographically dispersed across the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| so our in-person engagement was geographically dispersed kind of everywhere across the unincorporated county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| as well as actually in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| and then also provide different times of day that folks can connect with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| We actually did a virtual workshop as well for folks to engage that might not be able to attend in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| as well as that online survey option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| But I'll also say that one of the other things that we are going to be doing with our project management team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| is a debrief of phase one engagement to understand if there are any other ideas of ways that we can connect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1232)|
| 0:20:40| ways we can help spread the word to further disseminate this message for subsequent phases of engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1240)|
| 0:20:47| And one last thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| I think I was looking at other things in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| but one of the things I saw right here is transportation and something about gas and some other things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| We're in a kind of volatile situation about our economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| and I guess our economy does give an influence of what we can and cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| Have you made or thinking about maybe an alternate plan if something happens drastically to our economy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| So one of the things that we actually are looking at as kind of a companion to our scenario planning analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| is we're thinking about some of the future trends that may affect the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| and that is really more of a research-based effort to kind of be as a companion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| to what's actually maybe testing some of those transportation and land use questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| But that's where we're trying to look at things like the volatility that could come from extreme weather events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| or from economic downturns or those types of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| and just understand maybe what research is out there and what impact that could have on a county like ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| Along the same lines as the communication piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| are you planning to format it pretty much the same way you did the first time around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| I mean, are you going to be announcing public meetings again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| And so what will people see the second time that came the first time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| I mean, are they actually going to see diagrams or just summaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1339)|
| 0:22:28| Tell me why I should get somebody to come to a second meeting that already went to the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Yeah, great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| So I guess first to answer the first part of that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| we anticipate that likely the second round of engagement will be structured in a similar way to the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| We definitely like that combination of online and in-person events to capture as many folks as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| We may tailor that a little bit just based on other feedback that we receive from our project management team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| or others to try to maximize our participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| In terms of what we're going to be covering in that second round of engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| I think this is an opportunity to let participants that may have engaged with us the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| see what we've done with their feedback and how we've taken the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| So it's going to be different than what they have seen the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| In the first meetings, they would have seen maps that were kind of a blank slate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| tell us what's on your mind, give us some of your feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| In the second meetings, they're going to be seeing things related to our scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| so where we're starting to build out some of these concepts of what could things look like in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| and tell us what you like, tell us what you don't, what you want to see more of, what you'd like to see less of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| So really moving toward the direction of those recommendations and starting to see the impacts on growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1424)|
| 0:23:52| on things like congestion from our transportation system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| answering some of those questions that I think are on people's minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| So I'm hopeful that in that second workshop, people really get to dive in with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| and see things like maps, see report cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| I think that's one of the big takeaways, almost maybe a consumer report style, comparing these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| what's happening to answer each of these different questions, how well are we doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| and then offering us feedback about, well, what does that mean to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| how would I like to see that change and progress as we actually get into our recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| Is there any kind of, do you venture anything like a cost analysis, or tell me what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1471)|
| 0:24:39| Yes, great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| So yes, as a part of our scenario planning analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| we actually have a fiscal impact analysis that we're doing for each of our scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| So the intent of that is to understand the ramifications in terms of tax revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| but also in terms of cost burdens, kind of looking on both sides of the coin there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| And so that is actually going to be one of the indicators that we would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| that folks will have the chance to look at and understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| well, this is what it would mean to the county if we were actually to move forward with an idea like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| So yes, that will be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| As far as the need for, like, increased revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| or how specific do you get on that type of scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| I mean, everybody kind of knows that what we're going to do is going to cost a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| and probably way more than we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| So do you understand where I'm coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| Yes, so I think one of the things that's going to be helpful on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| is that we're thinking about it from both the cost as well as the revenue side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| So this is also the opportunity to think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| with 20 years' worth of growth and change within the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| what does that look like to our tax revenues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| So understanding from, you know, a residential employment perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| based on what we might be considering in a various scenario, here's what that could look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| But then we also have kind of the other side of it, which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| and here's the cost burden to do that same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| And so understanding, I think, that balance may be helpful to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| Thank you, Commissioner Hill. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| Unfortunately, our director of Knoxville-Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| has announced that she will be stepping down in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| What effect will that have on this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| and have you ever been in a project this size that had a change in leadership midstream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1600)|
| 0:26:48| Thanks for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| So as thinking about this, I guess we are fortunate to have a robust project management team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1609)|
| 0:27:00| leading this on the staff side for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| So I think we are supported by folks from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| from the TPO, as well as from city county planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| And that group actually meets with us weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| We meet with the large group biweekly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| and then with our core project manager from the county on a weekly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| So we are fortunate to have a consistent communication from a large group of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| And I think that that leadership is going to be critical for us continuing forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| We actually were fortunate to meet with that group earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| And so we try to have extra meetings, even when we're in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| in addition to some of those virtual meetings that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| As far as changes in leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| yes, staffing changes do impact many of the plans that we are a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| I think that my takeaway here is that there's a consistency in terms of direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| that we have received and that we anticipate to continue receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| that should help us kind of smooth through any of those ins and outs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| in terms of folks changing their roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| Allison, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| I know everywhere I go, every new person I meet, every group I speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| they always ask, what's the biggest thing on Commission's radar right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| And my answer is always, it's this, because this is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Next we have the Alcoa Highway Corridor Plan presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| I'm sorry, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| Separate of this, I'm sorry, I tried to grab you before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Whenever it's appropriate, I had one item I failed to ask to be pulled from consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| which I think I can do at any point with two-thirds of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| Absolutely, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| When it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| You want to do it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Item number 11, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| I'd like to have that pulled from consent with Commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| It is already pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| It was already mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Mr. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, members of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| I'm Jeff Welch, the staff of the Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| Partial response to your question earlier, Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| several of us from planning staff have been actively engaged in advanced Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| and I will continue to be, as well as the rest of the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| heavily engaged in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| But an appropriate question to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| At the request of this body and Knoxville City Council about three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| you asked the director of Knoxville-Knox County Planning to undergo a corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| study for Alcoa Highway in consideration of the redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| or reconstruction of Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| the impact that would have on the land uses along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| And we were able to finally get to that work program due to a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| different reasons, COVID, change in leadership and staffing and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| So we undertook this study this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| We primarily are a focus area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| If you know Alcoa Highway, there's a lot of public land there that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| developable, so our focus area was primarily the Montlake to Maloney area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| that has currently just been completed and fully opened by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| reconstruction of Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| Getting into this process, we took advantage of the community's effort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| about three years ago working with the East Tennessee Community Design Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| and they held a charrette with the developers and architects and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| community to brainstorm also the different ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| what they would like to see happen in the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| how can they revitalize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| I've been here for 30-plus, 35-plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| and it's gone through a lot of transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| and right now it's probably at its lowest point as far as utilization of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| any of the commercial properties in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| So the desire is to try to make Alcoa Highway a destination if at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| possible was the input we received early on from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| So looking at that, we then engaged in three public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1878)|
| 0:31:25| met with developers and met with the business owners in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| and have developed a series of recommendations that we have presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| to the community and presented to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| and the planning commission has recommended approval of the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| With that, I want to introduce Michelle Portier from our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| and she will make a presentation on the major steps of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| and the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| So thank you, Mr. Chair and commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| I'll try to be brief and respect your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| In the first few slides, we'll talk about why the plan is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| then we'll look at some of the outreach and research that went into the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| and then the recommendations themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| So in looking at why the plan is important, according to APA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| some of the issues with older and underperforming retail corridors are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| minimal buffering from adjacent residential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| minimal outdoor equipment storage screening standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| front-loaded parking areas undermining pedestrian access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| aesthetics that don't really reflect a community standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| excessive noise, lighting, vibration, and odors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| and high amounts of heavy freight traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| Additionally, we have indicators of decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| Alcoa Highway has five of these seven, so declining property value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| age and condition of structures, vacancy rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| undeveloped parcels surrounded by low property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| and there's also demographic and socioeconomic indicators in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| So then looking at additional things that Alcoa Highway has had to contend with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| there's a lack of population growth when you compare it with the rest of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| There's also been the ongoing road construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| and then high traffic fatal and serious injury crashes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| based on a TPO analysis that was fairly recently done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| Hopefully this study will be able to highlight some of the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=1996)|
| 0:33:24| that we're hoping to make that will alleviate some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| So this gets us into why we're doing this study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| and so as Jeff said, we're developing an approach for managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| and envisioning development and redevelopment along the highway corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| So this is kind of a list of the recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| and then we'll break each one of these down a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| as we get into the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| But to accomplish this objective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| we feel like allowing a broader array of land use along Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| would make things a bit more consistent between the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| Also protecting the vehicular safety improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| that come about through TDOT's changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| but also improving pedestrian safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| and creating consistency in the physical environment of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| and providing a unique sense of place for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| And so Jeff touched a little bit on how we arrived at all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| So there was four different prongs of research that we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| the first being a design charrette that we assisted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| the East Tennessee Design Center with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| as well as a lot of the residential groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| HOAs that kind of formed together and did some canvassing and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| developer meetings, additional research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| So from the charrette,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| we kind of ranked the answers that we got in order of consistency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| like how many people voted for each one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| and interestingly, the top six answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| were all retail or entertainment-related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| and the following next six were service-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| And then during the charrettes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| there were a few more uses that were identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| So the slides before were a canvas result of the HOA members going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| and actually talking door-to-door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| talking to other people who lived in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| kind of finding out what they wanted to see along the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| This was a more targeted activity that we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| with the East Tennessee Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| And so those uses that were identified were a small hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| a small multifamily development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| other medium-density residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| an independent living facility, offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| they were interested in a cat bus stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| general infill development, and live-work studios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| So when we met with developers, we were asking them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| what makes one site more viable for commercial activity than another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| And one of the factors that goes into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| is what they call the number of rooftops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| or the number of dwelling units within a one- and three-mile ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| And also the next thing you look at is the medium income level of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| The income, as we looked at for the demographics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| they really kind of vary depending on which census area you were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| But if you took all the census tracks that we looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| and kind of averaged them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| then they were on track with the rest of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| But they really did vary from one to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| So I do encourage you, if you haven't already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| to check out this on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| You can look at the economic indicators and population indicators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| and kind of get a better handle for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| But one thing, when you look at this slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| you can see that there's a lot of single-family development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| around the corridor and then patches of undeveloped land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| the high slopes that really would be kind of difficult to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| There's not a lot of variety in the housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| So if one of the factors that leads to a healthy commercial corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| or attracting commercial development is the number of rooftops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| then I think it's pretty clear you would need to introduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| a variety of housing types into this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| to kind of get a slightly higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| adding more rooftops to that area to make it a little more viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| I think one of the things that we all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| from traveling on Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| is that it's not necessarily easy to stop over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| So you're not really going to get a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| who are wanting to stop on their way home necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| That might change as people become more familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| with the traffic pattern that's in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| But most of what they're going to draw from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| is the rooftops in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| people that can get there from their own neighborhood streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| or that it would be convenient to stop on the way home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| because they're already heading into those side neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| So some of the opportunities that we see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| commercial development should be greater at the nodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| Those nodes are circled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| That's where you've got classified streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| running into classified streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| creating a little more traffic and movement in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| And so there's also several properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| along the arrows that are running to the east and west of Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| as Jeff described, the study area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| There's several properties that are underutilized within that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| and there's a big opportunity for infill development on large tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| and there's a sea of parking lots in some of those spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| where you could easily put smaller businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| and maximize properties that have already been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| And then, again, just kind of talking about that commercial viability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| that's driven by residential growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| So in looking at the zoning and how we could fix that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| it was a little bit difficult to compare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| the city's and the county's ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| but the city and county land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| it kind of goes back and forth within Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| It's not clear one side or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| You can have neighboring tracks along both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| that go from city to county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| So consistency in the uses that would be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| in each zoning ordinance became really important with that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| So what we did was we took the uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| the specific uses that are allowed in the county zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| and kind of fit those into the city's broader uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| to kind of compare apples to apples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| and identified what uses are allowed in one area, not the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| compared those with what uses people wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| to kind of see, okay, where can we make some changes here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| that could be beneficial to the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| And so that brings us to the first goal, which is a variety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| And so, next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| In creating a variety of land uses in the county...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| Next slide. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| So there's a mixed-use special district land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| that's been applied to this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| and it's kind of centrally located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| So we're wanting to stretch that out a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| and then amend the land use class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| to include a list of allowed zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| So within the county, I want to add some of the commercial land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| suggested in the charrette activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| to be added as a permissible use, as a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| in both the CA and the CB zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| and also add a variety of residential land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| as permissible as a use on review in the CA and CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| So right now, you have single-family homes and duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| that are allowed in the CA and CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| and then it scoops over any of that medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| to commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| whereas those medium-density residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| are typically considered a transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| between something that's commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| and something less dense like a single-family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| and then adding, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| some of those business uses that we'll get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| On the city side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| because the city's ordinance is done so recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| there's less change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| and so we're only adding for the research and development use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| to be permissible as a special use in the CG zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| One of the things we thought we could capitalize on in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| is the fact that UT's hospital was really close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| and that they also have a research and development park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Realtors in the area have expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| that real estate is so expensive in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| that some of the people who have reached out to her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| looking for R&D land have not been able to afford that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| So this is close enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| to where it would be still viable, still convenient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| but a little bit less expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| so we could potentially have some of those uses in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| So the CA and CB zone recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| would only be for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| It would be a short-term solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| As we saw from the advanced NOCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| there's going to be a lot that will come out of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| and hopefully an update to the county's ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| So this would be sort of a Band-Aid solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| until that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| with those of the city a bit more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| The thing to consider is that these uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| that we would apply to CA and CB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| would not only be for Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| but would be countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| So we did try to be conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| in what we suggested for these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| So what we're adding is the drive-through facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| These are already allowed in practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| but this would codify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| So right now, when you look through the county zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| some of the commercial zones say specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| that drive-through facilities are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| and others don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| So if you're someone who hasn't spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| with either our agency or with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| and you're looking for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| that would allow a drive-through facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| and you see it in one zone and not another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| you might think it's not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| So this is to kind of codify how it's already been applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| And then arts and fitness studios is the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| And in terms of the residential land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| that we're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| we are looking at multifamily townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| and dwellings above ground for mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Again, these are typically considered transitional uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| between something that's more commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| and then the single family that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| And this would be in an effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| to increase the number of rooftops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| in order to create a higher level of consumer base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| So this is that mixed-use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| the purple area that is highlighted with the circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| So we're proposing to stretch that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| to where it hits the institutional uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| So it's just south to the railway of IC King Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| on the west side of the Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| It's just past Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| And we're wanting to cross over Maloney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| so that it's on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| so that you have like versus like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| on both sides of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| so that when you're experiencing that street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| you have the same experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| The slide does say that we are proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| to extend it north to Mount Vernon Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| but that was the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| approved it without that extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| This is just a look at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| So because, again, the city and county land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| goes in and out so frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| so we would also have to extend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| along the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| And so in talking about the mixed-use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| and the sector plan as it exists now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| it doesn't recommend any zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| Most of the mixed-use special districts that we have do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| This one just talks about types of land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| that would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| So, for example, the shopping center zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| any of the larger scale commercial zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| that would be a little bit too intense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| any of those would be allowed under the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| how it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| So what we're proposing is on the city side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| to add CG1 and CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| I'm sorry, these are zones that already exist in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| and leaving those as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| In the county existing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| we have CA and CB and SC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| However, we don't feel like SC as a zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| meets the intent of what we're trying to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| in Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| So while there is one parcel that has the SC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| shopping center land use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| applied to it, it would be legal non-conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| They wouldn't have to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| but if someone wanted to rezone their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| to an SC land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| they wouldn't be able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| and still be in compliance with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| if this would go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| Adding the CN, Neighborhood Commercial Use, instead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| we feel like is a better fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| It is specifically designed to be next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| to residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| The uses that are within it are less intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| They're more professional services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| lighter commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| the type that people could quickly grab something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| on their way home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| or keep them from having to drive somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| to get something that they need to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| with some frequency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| The second goal that we identified was safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| And this was talking about protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| what TDOT's already done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| and also introducing some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| pedestrian safety standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| So this could include the first bullet point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| This could include limiting curb cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| So not really thinking in terms of what it's like now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| but thinking 20 years from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| when hopefully we've got more commercial uses there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| there's a higher number of people living there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| so there's a higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| a higher number of rooftops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| and so what that does to the traffic in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| So in wanting to limit conflict points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| we feel like limiting curb cuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| along those frontage roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| and linking them side by side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| and having those linkages within the middle of the sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| would be safer and more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| would facilitate faster traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| or smoother traffic along those frontage roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| Also adding sidewalks and greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| and also building the missing link of greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| between Knox and Blount Counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| that's not being built as part of the TDOT construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| And then finally providing a sense of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| So creating standards for commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| and multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| We want a consistent feel along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| We heard a lot of things about amenities in our shreds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| We heard a lot about signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| a lot about development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| And so looking at signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| there are ways that you could do monument signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| and things like that that are less intrusive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| but that would still provide a good degree of wayfinding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| so people knew where to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| when they were turning off the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| We did hear a lot about boulevards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| so there are some slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| and also landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| and higher standards for that along the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| So we think that whenever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| the Knox County Zoning Ordinance change does go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| that it could incorporate design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| for commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| that could include some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Again, these are things that we heard many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| with our outreach efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| from the canvassing results to the charrettes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| to the public meetings that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| This has been a common theme of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| that we've heard from residents in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| The residents in the area also worked with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| and with the city to get landscaping within the circles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| the roundabouts that are in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| They're very passionate about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| so we heard a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| I can't stress that enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| Landscape screening and buffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| between dissimilar uses within developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| lighting standards, parking lot locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Again, with the amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| this is a sampling of what we saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| dog parks, greenways, walking trails, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| And then highway signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| The residents are working with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| to get these types of signs along Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| I do not know where they are in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| but I know that they have begun negotiating that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| and I'm not sure at what phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| once TDOT is through this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| at what point that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| This is different from the signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| that would be within the various developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| And so, obviously, we're presenting to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| and to Knoxville City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| and I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Commissioner Daley and then Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Michelle, great presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| I was at a lot of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| I can't say a whole lot that you've not already said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| Great participation by the Lakemore Hills homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| communication board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| They've started a business coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| That's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| I've had Mike Odom out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| talking to some business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| trying to get that vision there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| There's 40-plus acres there that could be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| UT's just down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Maybe we can get UT in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| We need an anchor tenant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| Without an anchor tenant there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| it's going to be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| We need that anchor tenant there to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| We've made Alcoa Highway a lot safer, a lot faster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| but we've made it less business-friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| by the way the exits are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| the entrances, and the furniture roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| which it needed to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| But if we can get that one anchor tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| like I asked Mr. Odom to help us out on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| that'll be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| Just put a few notes while you're going through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| Number one, we need that anchor tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| We can get Chick-fil-A on both sides of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| Guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| We've got that 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| We've got the business total issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| We have a signage by TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| If you miss the cutoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| you're going to have to go miles down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| to turn around and come back and get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| TDOT needs to do it a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| Since we've had all these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| we've lost our CBS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| We've lost our fitness center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| We've lost a few other stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| Subway's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| And we're getting more rooftops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| That's the main thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| We need more rooftops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| We've got to have more rooftops there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| We have these businesses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| We've got to come up with some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| of working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| to get that anchor tenant there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| so we can get people to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| So we can have the businesses come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| How much deserted will you get through there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| It really does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| So I do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| Excellent presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| Mr. Jelf and all the meetings we've had over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| Superior Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| Great meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| Great input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| Well-turned-out meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| So I really appreciate what you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| Commissioner Jett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| When will this report be public on nextplanning.org?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| So the draft is on the website now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| If you all vote for it and City Council approves it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| and it goes forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| then it would be considered adopted at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| I didn't see the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| I see the plans and studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| but I didn't see a draft of this on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| It should be on the left-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| Let me pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| I'll look for it again here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| Oh, it's under the ongoing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| The first goal was about rezoning certain properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3053)|
| 0:51:01| Obviously, we would need property owners to come and ask for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| It's not something we can proactively do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| other than laying out this overall zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| Actually, we're not planning on rezoning any properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| We're just planning on making changes to the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| and we're wanting to change the land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| So that is sort of that overarching more macro view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| It kind of looks very similar to the zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| but each land use has a list of zones that it allows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| and so the mixed-use special district would just kind of nailing that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| So if there's anybody that currently owns a piece of property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| they would be grandfathered, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| and they would continue to keep the zoning they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| unless it was sold or transitioned down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| Yeah, they would have to request to rezone their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| What we're proposing doesn't change the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| It changes that underlying land use map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| which they already have a commercial use in most instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| I mean, I think this is a really interesting example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| of the property rights versus what we collectively or the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| and we collectively or these legislative bodies think what should happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| I mean, there's going to be some point in which somebody's going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| hey, look, I've got my little thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| I'm sticking to it, and your little plan doesn't mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| Well, I will say, too, that the mixed-use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| does allow a lot of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| So that's the reason it's a mixed-use special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| So it's not just applying commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| It's not just applying residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| It contains both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| So it allows, like I said, the CG1, the CG2, CA, CB, NC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| but it also allows all those zones allow residential uses and commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| So I don't feel like it's limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| It's not taking someone's commercial land use and making it residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| It's not taking someone's residential and making it commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| It's taking one of those and making it both, if that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| Yeah, that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| What's the ranking order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| You mentioned that the planning commission didn't approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| with the Mount Vernon extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| So what if this body said, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| we'd like to approve it with the Mount Vernon extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| and the city decided that they wanted to do something completely different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| How does it become final form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| Let me check and see if that property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| Who outranks who or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| No, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| I think that it would probably depend on if the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| or county jurisdiction had that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| Let me check on KGIS and see if it's a city or a county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| It's one triangular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| Actually, it's a county property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| because recently they were trying to get the SC designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| and they withdrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| So why did the planning commission not do it with the Mount Vernon extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| So it's a small triangular piece of property up at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| I believe it is where Mount Vernon meets Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| And so the Martha Washington Heights neighborhood entry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| is very close to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| and the neighborhood residents were opposed to changing the land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| They actually wanted to see that become green space or a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| So they definitely were opposed to the commercial development there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| and that's why the planning commission voted to leave it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| And then my final question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| was there any work done by TDOT or any other body in advance of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3253)|
| 0:54:20| I mean, I'm not sure anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| pretty much everybody could have told you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| as soon as you stuck up barriers on either side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| and did these access roads that most of the businesses were going to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| It was a tough area to do business in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| It amazes me that TDOT has not done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| I think the first thing they should have done is put in signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| It's amazing to me that they still have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| Just crushing people's enterprises here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| and their businesses and their livelihoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| It's sort of a weird answer to a question to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| but, like, why wasn't a lot of this done on the front end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| I mean, we knew this thing was going to totally destroy commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| How come there wasn't more planning, funding, support on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| by either TDOT or by planning or any of our governing bodies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| So TDOT has their purview over the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| so I'm not sure what their practice is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| I don't know, Jeff, maybe you have any more ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| Could you work with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| It just seems like a lot of catch-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| for something that should have been figured out well in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| It wasn't like it was a surprise that it was going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| Yeah, I mean, we had our sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| both for that covered a major portions of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| as far as mixed-use development that we encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| and recognize this as a redevelopment area, an opportunity area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| So that work has been done over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| It's just now trying to identify the specific tools that can implement that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| And the challenge has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| is that the county zoning ordinance is so out of date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| that you can't do certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| that really encourage the mixed-use development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| encourages residential rooftops along that corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| and same with some of the city codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| trying to enhance those opportunities with some code modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| And even if the commission at some point adopts this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| and then wants to go on through zoning code administrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| we all have to remember that any change in the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| affects the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| So we want to make sure that we're being proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| and deliberative in those types of conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| As far as signage along that corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| it's unfortunately a bureaucracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| to get the Department of Transportation to put in appropriate signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| They won't do it until they have the entire corridor up and running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| And it's been very difficult even for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| There's not going to be anything to put up a sign for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| by the time they're done with the whole corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| Was there any compensation as part of the plan for anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| They essentially cut the oxygen off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| I'm sure if TDOT took property right away from private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| there was compensation along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| But as far as loss of access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| or any economic impact as a result of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| I'm not aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| I also wanted to just reiterate to your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| about rezoning people's business or properties or things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| even though that's not what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| We had a lot of transparency with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| and so I do feel like everyone that was along the corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| did know what we were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| If anyone was opposed to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| they had several opportunities to let us know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| We haven't heard any of that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| Mr. Welch, as this corridor study wraps up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| what is next on your all's agenda for corridor studies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| For corridor studies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| We're looking at Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| We're not sure we'll be able to get to it this fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| but we'd like to get to it within this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| The advanced NOx is taking our priority right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| but hopefully with TDOT is probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| in response to Commissioner Jay's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| they're three to five years probably easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| before they're into construction of that corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| so hopefully we can be able to get ahead of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| by a couple of years with Western Avenue, Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| from the Carnes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| That's exactly what I wanted to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| because the former 6th District Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| 3rd District Councilwoman Singh and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| both went before our bodies to ask for this study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| a few years back because of this precise reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| Western Avenue has redevelopment area within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| It has vacant land within the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| and Carnes widening of Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| and all the land out there, we wanted to be in front of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| so that we didn't get trapped behind the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| We were in front of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| Plus you've got Shod Road coming through there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| Yeah, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| I mean, Shod Road is probably another corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| that should be looked at as far as the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| We're seeing rezonings already on that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| Thank you, Mr. Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| Your line is off now, Mr. Ward, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| I got you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| We have no one signed up for public forum this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| so, Madam Clerk, that brings us to item F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| Approval of minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| Motion by Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| and a second by Commissioner Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| to approve the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| Minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| Mr. Chairman, a point of information on drive and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| Before she reads this in the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| I think there needs to be some corrections made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| H through O is listed as being in Commissioner Hill's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| and I believe they're in Commissioner Smith's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| And then P through S is listed in Commissioner Hill's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3604)|
| 1:00:10| and they're actually in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| Are you going off the current districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| I'm going off KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| But are you looking at the current districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| That's what my question was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| Is this still current in your district as of today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| Because if it is, and we're going to accept it this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| then it should designate the correct district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| Because if you put Antelope Lane into the precinct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3638)|
| 1:00:48| No, it says it's district three is the representative who lives at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| say, Waterstone Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| Does engineering exact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| Commissioner, if I may, I guess my suggestion would be that we move it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| forward once it's read, that we move it forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| and I will get with the law department and the commission office to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| ascertain exactly how this needs to be captured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3679)|

| 1:02:40| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| I have a motion to move forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| by Commissioner Daly, seconded by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| That item moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| Madam Clerk, please read the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| Item nine is deferred to August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| Item ten is consideration of the closure of a portion of Old Tadsville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| and the First Comforter Church to improve safety for motorists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| and adjacent residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| On second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Mr. Snowden, if you wouldn't mind to approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| For the purpose of discussion, I want to move that we postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| for another month to the August Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| I have a second by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| Mr. Snowden, would you mind speaking to kind of where we are with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| I'd be glad to, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| Since we met last time, myself and some of my staff met with the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| that came and spoke on behalf of opposing closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| They would like to, they've got another idea that involves actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| closing Luttrell Road's intersection entirely and allowing Old Tadsville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| So they, that group, had liked to maybe set up another meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| to kind of discuss that in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| Because one of my concerns with that is I think that could negatively impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| even more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| And that was my comment to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| TDOT, in the meantime, is actually going to do a traffic analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| because obviously the big concern of the folks that have came and spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| is the traffic congestion at Ridgeview at Tadsville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| And TDOT wants to look at that and they're willing to do a traffic analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| But due to the impact that the traffic at that location has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| when school was not in session, we wanted to delay that until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| at least school got back in session so that TDOT could get counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| And we could really look at that more accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| So I appreciate this body's consideration of moving that along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| to where TDOT can do that and we can have this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| and kind of vet out some of these other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| Certainly want to look at all those options to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| we get the best solution possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| We'll be cutting it a little bit close to shoot for August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| I suppose, you know, since school starts August 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| but we'll cross that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| We'll do as much as we can to get it in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| I know we'd like to move it along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| So we have a motion to postpone to the August commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| That's by Commissioner Beeler with a second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| That item is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| Number 11, line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| Total amount of $277,402.57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to move forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| and then I would like to address one of the items on the line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Have a motion by Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| with a second by Commissioner Jay to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| Mr. Schoonmaker, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3959)|
| 1:06:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| On the first line item transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| you have a budget transfer request for General Sessions, court judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| other professional services for $59,160.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| What entity is this designated for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| This would be a budget transfer to cover the negative budget amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3988)|
| 1:06:37| for salaries for substitute magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| So this is for our judicial magistrates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| And then is this a regular budget occurrence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| where they go over what their salary designation is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| So I think to answer your question, as you can see, this fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| this was through May, I believe, was $59,000 over budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| I think the last two years it's been around that figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| Three, four, five years ago it would probably range less than $10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| because ultimately a magistrate gets paid a certain amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4038)|
| 1:07:24| and then when they have to substitute, then we have to pay that substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4044)|
| 1:07:30| So when they're out, whether it be annual or sick leave, then we pay substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4050)|
| 1:07:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| Well, this obviously, we're hiring a lot of substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| It's a big number, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| On the $60,000 expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| Could you provide this body this week with the days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| that the five judicial magistrates have missed work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| We can do that, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| We track it by substitutes and we track it by magistrate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| and so we can share that information with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| And then are they under the same jurisdiction as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| they can accrue one day a month for sick leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4094)|
| 1:08:20| They probably follow, they either have their own handbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| or follow our handbook as it relates to annual and sick leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| but we do not track their leave in payroll like we do other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| The courts have historically tracked their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| And as the appointing authority, don't they actually report to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4119)|
| 1:08:45| The magistrates are appointed by county commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| I would defer to the law director, but I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| I have, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| I know Mr. Law Director is, if we find that there's a pattern of certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4138)|
| 1:09:06| individuals missing work from, as a judicial magistrate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| is there a way that this body could reduce their terms or reduce their salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4152)|
| 1:09:20| And you don't have to answer that if you want to look at that and then give us a. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| In general, state law requires you to have the magistrates and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4164)|
| 1:09:31| TIT says county commission must approve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| So you approve them, and then the judges can, under state law, can reject that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4174)|
| 1:09:42| I think it's only happened once, but you elect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| And in my opinion, since state law is very vague on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| it just says you shall set the compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| Probably you can set guidelines and structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| And as Chris said, they go under their own handbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| but you can make them fall under, in my opinion, by passing proper legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4203)|
| 1:10:10| you can make them fall under the same guidelines for sick leave and time off and that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4210)|
| 1:10:18| They're already covered under our insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| They're there, and I don't know what else they're under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| But, yes, you do have some controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| I can't tell you precisely what you can and can't do at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| but it's certainly worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| If this body wants that research, we'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| So you'll get the information to us this week on the five individuals, how many days they've missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4239)|
| 1:10:46| Would you want the current fiscal year or the last couple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| You tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| I guess this year and last year, but you'll have through this fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4251)|
| 1:10:57| because this $59,000 may not be an accurate figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| This is only for ten months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| Eleven months, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| And so then what I'll also do, if it's okay, if it helps you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| I can share what maybe the last five fiscal years what we've spent on substitutes during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4268)|
| 1:11:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| For comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| I think it might be important for Drew to request that the judicial magistrates appear next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4282)|
| 1:11:32| so we could actually ask them once we have the data this week on the days off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4292)|
| 1:11:39| Correct me if I'm wrong, they're supposed to work three days a week, 12-hour shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| I'm trying to remember from when we appointed some five years ago or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| I'm looking at the law director as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| But I think that they do work 12-hour shifts, and I believe it was three 12-hour shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| But they are classified as A1 employees in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| Mr. Caldwell, what was originally budgeted for this particular year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| Historically, we probably don't budget a lot because we don't know what's going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4333)|
| 1:12:20| I think like four years ago it was like $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| But it's gotten more prevalent as far as the amount that they're spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4344)|
| 1:12:32| So in the future we'll look to budget more just based off historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| I just want to make sure I get this correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| So magistrates are paid a full salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| I mean an annual salary, and they're required to work X number of days and X number of hours per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4368)|
| 1:12:56| And that supports the courts and all of the warrants, et cetera, that come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| When they are out for sick leave or vacation or something extraneous happens outside of the normal work world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4383)|
| 1:13:12| there is a budget to hire a substitute, and that's what this budget supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| Normally that's $5,000 to $10,000 at the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| And with 11 months of the year, we're at $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| And rising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| Which means somebody is not doing a lot of work, or somebody is out missing a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| and a lot of substitutes have had to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| How much do we pay a substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| I think we raise that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| I'll show you that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| I think this is equivalent to maybe 75, 80 days, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4423)|
| 1:13:50| That's a lot in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| Who tracks their time off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| Does the courts do it internally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| It doesn't have anything to do with our HR department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| So courts track their own leave balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| So they are not tracked through payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| And so ultimately Stephanie Candler nor I could see what their leave balances are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4455)|
| 1:14:22| Law Director, how would we request access for records of their leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4462)|
| 1:14:28| for what's been approved for the last three years within the court system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| I was discussing the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Say again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| How would this commission request the information from the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| to get records for the last three years of what's been approved for time off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| I guess just ask them for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| Who do we ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| Is there a board chair or a chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| The General Sessions Court has a revolving chief judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| I don't know who it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| I think they go with six-month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| Chris Rowe, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| Okay, Chris Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| Mr. Chairman, I mean, could it come from one of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| I would like to have those records requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| I don't need to do it personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| I'm happy to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| But if it's better to come from the body chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| I don't know what the legal mechanism for this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| for a legislative body as a judicial body for records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| I think it benefits the body as a whole in deliberations about these line-item transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| so I'll be more than glad to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| If Mr. Caldwell is going to provide what we've spent for the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| then I think it would be appropriate to get the records for the last five years to match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| so that we can see, you know, if it's a continuously rising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| I can just say from my perspective, if it's a continuously rising problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| where a budget is continually being blown year after year and it's getting worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| I have no appetite for just raising that budget instead of going back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| why are we having this issue in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| Commissioner Bussard, was your line on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| My line was on, but I just had a parliamentary type question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| This was on consent agenda, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| No, this was pulled from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| This line-item transfer was pulled from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| Okay, but this one item was pulled off with the rest of the line-item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| Were we supposed to vote on that or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| It was already pulled when I inquired about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| Oh, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| It was already off, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| Commissioner Wharton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| I was just adding to Commissioner Jaye's comments that I did the quick math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| I think they make around $106,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| They work about 156 days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| So if you just divide their salary by the days they work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| it comes out to like six and change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| If you do the math, basically collectively they're missing 90 days of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| in total out of 156.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| So you're talking about 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| If it's one person, I'm sure it's not just one person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| but that's still a considerable amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| Anything 30 or above would be outrageous in my book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| So adding some context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| Thank you, Commissioner Wharton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| Mr. Caldwell, the amount that is budgeted for our magistrates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4643)|
| 1:17:31| I believe I heard you say that they qualify for vacation days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| and sick days just like other employees of their same classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| This money is above what is budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4660)|
| 1:17:47| So it's over the sick days that are budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| It's over the vacation and leave days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| This is eating all that up, plus it's still another $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| So just to kind of clarify, you've got five magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| Don't hold me to these numbers, but I think four make about $105,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| which is around what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| I think the chief makes about $113,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| So that's salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| Then there's benefits, all those benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| And then this line item is just for the substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| And so that's above all those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| This total amount budgeted, though, that's already budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| has within its budget the allowance to pay substitutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| for days that the magistrates can officially have off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| And so ultimately what we would do is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| that office may request a certain amount per year for substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4729)|
| 1:18:56| They may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| They don't ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| We probably don't budget anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| But an amount this high is a lot more than when it's usually between, like, $2,000 and $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4741)|
| 1:19:09| That's manageable, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| And so I think ultimately, too, if you ask us, you know, how many annual or sick leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4751)|
| 1:19:23| what's the balance of annual or sick leave for those employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| we can't give it to you like we could anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| Well, he hasn't had a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| You're right, and you've already spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| Chris, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| Can you follow up on Commissioner Schoonmaker and Commissioner Hill's comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| Who sets their salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| So, you know, ultimately their salaries, I guess, technically are set by county commission when the budget's adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4793)|
| 1:20:03| I will tell you in the past, the judges normally have a, I don't know what they call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4803)|
| 1:20:11| like a head judge that oversees the magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| In the past, before Judge Emory retired, they were struggling to get magistrates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4814)|
| 1:20:22| so he worked to up their salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| And so over time we got those salaries to where they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| But the ultimate decision on what they make would be up to county commission is my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4831)|
| 1:20:38| I would defer to the law director, but that's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| I'll follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| Can we make this a contract position for days' work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| Not the way I read the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| The state statute says that, and they call them judicial commissioners now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| or magistrates is what they used to call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| says that the county commission will elect them or appoint them and set their salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4859)|
| 1:21:06| I don't think you can do it as a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| Director Caldwell, you said these are Class A employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| so I assume that they accumulate sick time and work time and annual leave the same way every county employee does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4880)|
| 1:21:29| Yes, so I was talking to Stephanie, and so we do think the courts follow our employee handbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| so they would get the same leave as any other county employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| and so basically year one is 12 days of annual, 12 days of sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| So they're on the 40 or the 37 1⁄2 since they work 36?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| I think because they work 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| Since they track their own leave, I don't know what they're giving themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| Unlike regular employees such as myself or Mr. Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| if we take off, they don't have to hire somebody that day to work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| So I think the real key here is, is anybody using more than their accumulated vacation time and more than their sick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4927)|
| 1:22:15| Are they just using what we allow them, and it comes with a cost that's not associated with other employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| I mean, so one thing, once one of the commissioners, I think it was Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4941)|
| 1:22:29| talked about getting their leave balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| It would be good to know because from a liability standpoint, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| If they're long-tenured employees, then they could earn as much as four weeks a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4955)|
| 1:22:42| and so what are they taking off versus that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| I don't want to say that they're taking off more than they should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| but ultimately, to your point, when they do take off, there's an impact if there's a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4971)|
| 1:22:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| Just by hearing what we've heard today, it sounds like to me that a line-item transfer has kind of uncovered an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4984)|
| 1:23:10| that we may have with either a scheduling conflict or somebody that has some sort of illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4990)|
| 1:23:18| My question is, if we get the magistrates here next week and we discover that it is some sort of illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| would we have to go into an executive session if we start talking about doctor's excuses, HIPAA violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5005)|
| 1:23:33| That's my question for that since it's broadcasted on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| Can we just say X?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| If somebody says, I have this issue, this is what I'm battling, if they're battling an illness or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| I would say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| I think you could easily say that I use my sick leave and that's fine because you're accrued to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5026)|
| 1:23:53| and if that's what it is, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| Or I use my annual leave and I accrued this much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| You've earned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| You've accrued it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| That's okay, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| And I think, just not trying to pass the buck, but ultimately, as the law director said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| I think this body are the ones who dictate things for the magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| So I think ultimately you all have to decide if you want to set policies or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5053)|
| 1:24:21| But ultimately, I think I can't tell you currently if they used annual or sick leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| All I can say is what has been spent on substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| So my next question is, will you provide us with a policy and procedure manual for them as well so we can see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| It's the county one, so we can easily do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| Same as the general county one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| So three days you need a doctor's excuse to come back to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| I think what it says is if you take three days off, then you can ask for a doctor's excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| It doesn't mandate one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| Commissioner Jay, then Ward, and then I'll give Commissioner Schoonmaker the last word since you're the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| This is the, in the last several months, this is the second set of employees that fall under the commission purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5104)|
| 1:25:13| Are there other, you know, these things get discovered as things come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5113)|
| 1:25:19| because the regular order of government business is what it is until something happens or we dig into something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5119)|
| 1:25:25| Are there other employees that fall under this purview that are not directly supervised by someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5125)|
| 1:25:33| that we need to start really paying attention to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| I don't want to miss anybody, so if I leave anybody out, it's not intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| Of course, the commission office falls under your purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| Internal audit falls under your purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| The magistrates apparently fall under your purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| I don't know if I'm forgetting anybody else, but those are the ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| Merit falls under your purview, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| And so that may be all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| And so, yeah, that's all that I can think of right off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| I may have missed one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| It just seems like, I mean, we are the governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| We're responsible for the checkbook, and ultimately we have to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| there has to be some oversight and connection point to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| if we're responsible at the end of the day to the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| then we sure better know who's under the wings so we can manage things properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| or have at least a series of checks to manage things because they made all the decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5193)|
| 1:26:40| In this case, we still have a lot of facts to find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| but in this case somebody made a lot of decisions that cost the taxpayers an extra $60,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| that ultimately the only people that are accountable for are the 11 people sitting at this dais.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| So we've got to sort of better have some sort of system in order to make sure that we're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5216)|
| 1:27:03| that we understand what is happening because ultimately we are the ones responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| and they make the decisions, but we're left holding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| So I don't know what that looks like down the road, but it ought to be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5231)|
| 1:27:17| Yes, Commissioner Schoenbeck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| Basically, that's kind of what I was hitting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| Go in the same direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| I think because this body is responsible for four entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5245)|
| 1:27:31| there needs to be some kind of oversight committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| and we may want to look at that on September 1st, establishing one so that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5255)|
| 1:27:41| instead of 11 members meeting on an issue like this, it could be four or five members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5261)|
| 1:27:46| that would be meeting with the different entities on issues like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| Commissioner Ward, the floor is yours, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| I was going to say the same thing, but quick question, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| Do we approve the substitutes as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| Is there, like, an approved list we pull from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| How are they selected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| I'm going to probably get this wrong, but ultimately I think there is a list of substitutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| that the magistrates can pick from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| I've never seen the list, but I think they have a list of approved substitutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| that they choose from when they get to when they're going to be out for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| Okay, and we're going to get that list and who substitutes for who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| I will, if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| I don't mind to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| There's a lady down there, I cannot think of her name right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| I'll ask for that list, and I'll ask for the annual and see what I can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| I'm just looking to see if there's a trend somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| We have a motion before us to move line-item transfers forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| That motion was by Commissioner Schoonmaker, seconded by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| That item moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| Commissioners, after we hear the next item, I would like to hear item 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| and then take a brief recess before we finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| There's no budget amendments listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| And then the spread of record is travel for the Mental Health Association's annual conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5353)|
| 1:29:20| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| I believe that brings us to item 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5361)|
| 1:29:29| There are no lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5369)|
| 1:29:40| Well, there's nothing listed, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5380)|
| 1:29:53| It wasn't provided when the agenda was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| but we have two pages of budget amendments that, if you go online, they do show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| Well, then, Chair, we'll entertain a motion to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| I'd like to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| I do have a comment on just one of the budget items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| I have a motion by Commissioner Schoonmaker, seconded by Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| to move budget amendments forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| If I could have a representative from the Board of Education slash Knox County Schools come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| I have a question about on page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| There's a designation for technology device payment of $727,540.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5427)|
| 1:30:36| I just needed clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5436)|
| 1:30:55| Thank you, Commissioner Beaver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| So, we actually, I think, came more prepared to answer question 18 than Mr. Daley had asked us earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5459)|
| 1:31:06| So, I may have to look and get that for you to make sure on the technology for what that's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| It's just my understanding that this goes back to the computers that you purchased for each student in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5470)|
| 1:31:17| I thought you guys purchased those outright with funds, and this is a lease payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5477)|
| 1:31:25| So, I do know that the computers are on lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| I mean, as far as how we purchased those, how those were purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| So, the exact of what this is and the federal dollars were used for that for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5492)|
| 1:31:38| Some ESSER, the very first federal dollars that were released were used for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| And then, I think, initial of the payments after that were used out of the other ESSER $3 that were released later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5503)|
| 1:31:50| So, I can look into that for sure and make sure we have the right numbers for what this item is for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| It was approved by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| I just wanted to clarify that we were leasing those computers as opposed to just outright purchasing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5526)|

| 1:32:54| Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| Dr. Superintendent, you're going to have to come up with a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| Who's your cohort standing beside you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| So this is Dr. Garfield Adams, our Assistant Superintendent of Operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| And I'll let him handle your questions on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| Thank you, Chairman Beeler and Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| This is basically...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| Let me ask a question so they know what the question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| I pulled this for the simple reason that the federal government is going to be cutting the school lunch program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5603)|
| 1:33:31| A few years back, we had parents that didn't pay, and I think we had a benefactor that paid for the school lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5611)|
| 1:33:39| My question is, since the federal government is going to cut back on the reduced and free lunches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| how is this going to affect our kids, number one, the kids that may not get lunch and the parents that can't afford lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5623)|
| 1:33:52| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| Yeah, great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| Schools that are community eligibility provision schools, those schools will continue to get free and reduced lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5635)|
| 1:34:02| Of course, those are identified schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| For the most part, families will have to apply for free and reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| If they are eligible, they will still continue to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| And then we will go back to the traditional way of collecting fees for breakfast and lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5651)|
| 1:34:19| How many kids...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5659)|
| 1:34:24| I guess, how many kids do you see that will not be getting lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| I see that as a problem, that the kids will not be getting lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| I've got a district that parents are not going to fill out that paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| I can tell you that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| They're not filling out that paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| Grandma, grandpa, aunts and uncles will help out before they fill out that paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| And they really need to be filling that paperwork out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| I can see that this federal government decision is really going to hurt not only Knox County students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5689)|
| 1:34:57| but students all across this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| Hopefully somebody up there will make a wise decision, will make a politics, and restore this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5699)|
| 1:35:07| I would agree, and I completely understand your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| I will say, Brett Foster, she is my chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| I believe she's the chief of food services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| She has been very active in getting that communication out to families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| We've taken to social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| We've gotten a great response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| The families who do need to fill out that paperwork, I'm a former principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| It was always an issue with getting our families to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| But with this social media outlet, I do believe we'll be able to capture those families and give them the support that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| Commissioner, I have a couple more questions from commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| So if you gentlemen will hang around for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| Commissioner Durrett, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| Mr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| But isn't it true that there are some schools that will remain as a school-wide free lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5755)|
| 1:36:04| Yes, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| Those schools, and I want to get the correct terminology, those schools are the community eligibility provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| and they call them provision two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| So, yes, those schools that are identified will continue to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| So that's not gone away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| That's not in danger of going away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| As long as those schools qualify, they will still continue to get free and reduced lunch and breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| Mr. Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| Dr. Roswick, I learned about this issue last week through a valuable tool that I'd like to commend you on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| It's ParentSquare, where if you have a student enrolled in Austin County Schools, you have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| Is there any way that you can make that available to our fellow commissioners where the messages come up on their app that they could have as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5802)|
| 1:36:49| Because there's stuff that comes up there that I feel like would be valuable to them if they're interested in downloading the app on their cell phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5809)|
| 1:36:56| I feel like a very valuable tool as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| We did make a switch over to more parent-friendly communication, ParentSquare, and began that last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5820)|
| 1:37:07| So we'll get with our communication team and see what we can do to try to give you all access for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| And if I could, just real quick, go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| Chris and I had a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| That is an early payment on the lease, the $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| I think you said $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| So it was a lease payment, but we had some funds available to pay that early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| So that's what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| So sorry to switch subjects, but I wanted to make sure I got that back to you while we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| And go ahead, Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| Commissioner Biggs, we actually, with our community partners, we're actually giving them access to ParentSquare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| So that is something that we can definitely do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| As Commissioner Durrett said, there are schools that will remain designated free lunch programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5866)|
| 1:37:52| The problem I see is poverty and struggle reaches every one of our schools in different quantities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5872)|
| 1:38:00| What are we going to do to make sure we reach out to those that are in these districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| these schools that are not covered, to get them signed up, to get them the benefits that they need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| Commissioner Smith, well, number one, we really need to work with principals at the school level, and that's where it starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5891)|
| 1:38:17| But communication is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| I can tell you the social media outlets are the way to get most of our families who normally, traditionally do not sign up free and reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5899)|
| 1:38:28| I think there is more of an intense focus on signing up because we've gotten accustomed to just free and reduced overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5908)|
| 1:38:36| And so that communication has been put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| And so we've had families starting to reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| We just have to be very intentional on supporting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| Working with our food nutrition department, basically the families who it takes them a while to get signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5925)|
| 1:38:53| we do not go after those families for them to have to pay any debt that they owe to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5933)|
| 1:39:04| Strangely enough, we're actually a few weeks away from school starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| Have we had any communication to these schools that are going to be affected that will no longer be automatically enrolled in the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5947)|
| 1:39:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| Yes, we've had communications with principals and schools that will no longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| And so the principals do know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| Are they passing it on to the student body, the parents, the guardian?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| Yes, that communication has been sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| So we just need to be more intentional on continuing to put that information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| And welcome to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| Welcome back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| I'm a Knox County guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| And the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| I mean, gosh, any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| Yes, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| Just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| Kudos to the Food Service of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| I know that if a child leaves our schools hungry, it's because nobody knew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=5990)|
| 1:40:00| Because we have got a terrific cafeteria staff and the cafeteria managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6000)|
| 1:40:08| And really, each of you, if you go in and visit your schools, I hope it will take a second to stick your head in the cafeteria and speak to the cafeteria workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6008)|
| 1:40:18| They are all a bunch of mamas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| And if they know our children are fed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| And really, the teachers do that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| But our cafeteria folks are outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| Commissioner Hill, I appreciate you saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| I would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| And I will tell you, even my chief of food services, she is boots on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| There is many a time she has actually went in and if we were short for the mamas, because it is a very family-oriented team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6042)|
| 1:40:52| And so I appreciate you saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| I would definitely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| Dr. Rosick, would it be hard since next month, myself and a couple of my fellow commissioners last month on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6059)|
| 1:41:06| to have a small presentation that shows where we are at on Adrian at Lonsdale and Northwest Elementary School for us for next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6066)|
| 1:41:15| just as a quick update for the fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| I think we could definitely do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| We are monitoring those and have a plan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| So I think we could see Dr. Adams again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| It is his department, but we will definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| He has come back to commission every month now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| But we will definitely put something together if that is good for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| And we will leave it at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| Thank you, Dr. Rosick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| Thank you, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| Commissioners, we do have a motion on the floor to approve this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| That is by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| The second was by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| That item passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| We will go into recess and we will come back at 6.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6117)|
| 1:42:03| All right, commissioners, this work session is back in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| Madam Clerk, would you please read item 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| Oh, pardon me, 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| Item 22 is Resolution 209.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| It is authorizing the acceptance of summer learning loss bridge camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| summer learning camp, and stream mini-camp grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| in the total amount of $7,128,386.54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6147)|
| 1:42:34| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| I have a motion to approve by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| Second by Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| Is there any discussion of this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| That item is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| Now, Madam Clerk, item 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6170)|
| 1:42:58| It's Resolution 905 to provide for all future development within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| Fort Silver River Industrial Park to comply with the provisions of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| Commissioner Biggs is not in his seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| so I as one of the sponsors will move to approve this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6195)|
| 1:43:24| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| Second by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| Mr. Snowden, if you could come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| Commissioner Jay, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| I defer to the sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| I just kind of wanted to understand the context of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| but I imagine you might introduce it before I question it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| Mr. Snowden, if you wouldn't mind, kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| Be glad to, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| Commissioner Jay and the rest of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| Yeah, this was something that we had, I think in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| we approved a revision to this agreement for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| I think it might have been for Sineas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| I can't recall at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| But as part of that, there was another development that came in that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6243)|
| 1:44:08| an issue with the front setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| And this, there is an old, I think circa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| I think it's in your all's package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| some of the 1970s when the park was originally created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| Those setbacks and a lot of those what we consider to be zoning issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| today are different than the Knox County zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| So if you develop industrial property anywhere in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| you're going to have certain setbacks and certain height restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| and certain guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| If you develop those in the Forks of the River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6278)|
| 1:44:41| you're going to have a different set of standards and primarily because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| and Mr. Moyers may know this probably better than I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| but I think that document even precedes the Knox County zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| So what we're trying to do with this is just for future folks that come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6293)|
| 1:44:58| to be more consistent with our current zoning setbacks and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| once developments do come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| whether they're redevelopments or new developments in the Forks of the River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| that they comply with the Knox County zoning ordinance and not the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| document created at the time the park was developed in the 1970s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6313)|
| 1:45:20| Thank you, Mr. Stone. Mr. J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| So the current ordinance exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| Why would, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| it seems like we're passing an ordinance to say comply with the thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| already exists that you should be complying with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| But I think there's language in the parks agreement that this body has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| assume they have to approve amendments to that agenda or that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6340)|
| 1:45:47| I don't believe that the passage of the zoning ordinance superseded that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| That document still lives and you all have to make amendments to it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| comply with the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| I see. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| So there's sort of an end around for somebody if they wanted this sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| closes the loop and says going forward the zoning ordinance is the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| that we're following and you've got to follow all the rules and regs or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| And then, of course, anything grandfathered sticks around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| And that way, you know, we've had one in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| Now we've got one now is that park, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| redevelops over time or has new developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| We won't be continuously bringing those revisions back to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| They'll just comply to the Knox County zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| And if there's a deviation of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| then there's a process through the board of zoning appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| which is normal for most practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| Mr. J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| So, in other words, Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| that we can't get them to amend their document that they have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| since 1973.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| We have to do the amendment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| I mean, they can't just update their.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| Mr. Moyers is probably more knowledgeable than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| What we're talking about is like a master deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| And it says specifically within it that the provisions can be changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| or waived by the county commission for good cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| rather than doing it on a case by case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| We're just updating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6429)|
| 1:47:10| Just going to waive it all and make it applied or make the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| So that's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6436)|

| 1:50:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| Fellow commissioners, I just wanted to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| that on the online agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| there have been a few minor tweaks since last you looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6620)|
| 1:50:27| This is as a result of a number of different pieces of feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| One, you all as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| several of you who chimed in on the commission forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| had certain questions, concerns, or thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| that led to better language and improving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| I also continue to get feedback from different officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6645)|
| 1:50:51| and people within the law enforcement community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| And then last week, I had a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| There was an open meeting for FOP members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| where I spent several hours directly with officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| answering questions, again, continuing to get feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| And then we had a meeting with the Knox County HR Senior Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| to discuss personnel matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| And the mayor's team got feedback from that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| and then continued to work with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| So the latest proposed reforms are probably 97% what you saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6677)|
| 1:51:23| when we discussed this last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| But there are a few tweaks to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| And then, of course, I have a top sheet kind of narrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| that outlines what the proposed reforms are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| So I'll be happy to answer any questions that you all may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| and continue to believe that this is a good opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| to modernize and reform our merit system and our board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6701)|
| 1:51:47| and the processes that protect our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| And I also just wanted to point out that several of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| have received emails from people and a few calls myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| from people in the community who want to support our officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| want to support law enforcement, and have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| you know, if this passes and we go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| then I'd love to sign up and see if I might be somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| who can help serve on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| So I think that there's a willingness in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| to support our officers in a service capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| So it's encouraging to me, and I hope it is to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| So I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| Are there any questions from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| I do see Mr. Mark Taylor in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| Mr. Taylor, would you please come to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6754)|
| 1:52:49| Sir, would you mind stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| My name is Mark Taylor, and the address is 724 Hall of Fame Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| I'm the president of the Fraternal Order of Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| Volunteer Lodge No. 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| Thank you, Mr. Taylor, for your time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| I just wanted to hear your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6786)|
| 1:53:11| especially one of the things that has been an issue for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| personally is that I feel like on the very end of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6796)|
| 1:53:22| the last 42-67 that deals with grievances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| that it could be kind of limiting on what could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| and could not be considered a grievance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| I just wanted to hear your thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| So, one, I'll thank Commissioner Jay for coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6811)|
| 1:53:38| and making himself available to our membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| And this has been, I think, fairly ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6821)|
| 1:53:47| and maybe contentious at times issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| So I understand, and we've had a good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| We talked about a lot of things in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| and I understand a lot of the intent on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| I think any time that you can make something nonpolitical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| or whatever, that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| I've heard probably more folks with concerns about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6847)|
| 1:54:14| than I've heard from folks that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| and when I say folks, average rank and file folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| that I would talk to are members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| And that's not untypical, because people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| when they have a problem, they reach out to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| that they think represent them or that can represent them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| and they air those, and we talk and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| So a good bit of it I do understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| I understand that it's hard to hire people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| I understand that it can be confusing between systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| and this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| I think the size of the board at seven is, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6892)|
| 1:54:58| and I've expressed this to Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| is too large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| Maybe three is too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| From what he said, I can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| If one person misses or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| I think if you go around the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| five is probably the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| Knoxville Civil Service, I believe, is five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| if I understand correctly, Metro Nashville is five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| Shelby County or Memphis Area is five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| and I think Chattanooga is five or smaller, maybe three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| if the information I have is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| I know Knoxville is five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| So that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| I know that a lot of times we have problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| getting people to field boards and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| so if you're replacing people on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| I think seven is lofty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| And I think you can get too big on a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| Then on the grievance section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| that's probably the section that we had the most problems with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| And here's why we have the problems with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| or the things that have been communicated to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| and things that just kind of stick out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| So that starts, and basically it says dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6968)|
| 1:56:16| Well, yeah, if you fire me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| I probably should have some means of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| hey, I don't think that's correct or whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| But dismissal is a pretty limited and, to me, a definite term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6988)|
| 1:56:34| That means I've been fired, I don't have a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| So I think by making it that strong right off the bat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=6998)|
| 1:56:44| I think you're limiting anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| that the merit council could serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| I have no problems with trying to get politics out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| As a matter of fact, it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| It was designed for just that purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| to keep politics out of elected officeholders and employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| And I think there's value to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| But when we limit it that much, or in my mind, as an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| and from the employees I've heard about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| when you limit that much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| then you don't allow an avenue for employees who say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| and specifically relating to the old law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| it's because of political decisions and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7041)|
| 1:57:26| instead of merit decisions and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| So it's trying to provide balance between employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| and that elected official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| whether it be a sheriff, whether it be whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| But that's the point of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| So when you limit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| then you cut off another avenue for employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| if they choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| And most employees don't go and file a grievance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| I can tell you I talk to employees fairly often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| about whether they think the decision that was made to them was fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| or whether it wasn't or what things, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| And I don't typically take a side on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| I give them information and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| But one of the last things I advise them is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| hey, even if you're absolutely right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| you need to consider whether it's worth it to you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| because you may take your lumps here and you may move along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| and you may meet other goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7098)|
| 1:58:23| So it's not like I don't feel like tons of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| are filing grievances in the first place on a lot of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| But if you close that off to where they can't file a grievance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| say you have that one thing where you can't file a grievance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| then that automatically pushes it to lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| And we say kind of the goal of it is to limit lawsuits or to limit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| So I think when you limit the ability of an employee to address something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7125)|
| 1:58:51| without taking it to a court or to this or that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| especially in today's hiring population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| So old guys like me, we let a lot of stuff slide at the workplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| and we took our lumps and we moved on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| and we navigated our way through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| That's not the case with the people you're trying to attract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| to fill the vacancies at the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| or anywhere else these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| They'll tell you what they think and you better be able to answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| and you better be confident enough in the decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| that you made to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| And if you don't have that open environment now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| and you don't have that sort of flexible relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| between bosses and employees, you're not going to retain employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7168)|
| 1:59:34| And I've been screaming this for quite a few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| even at my own organization, because it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| Those dynamics have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| So the biggest problem I have with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| and the biggest problem that's been expressed to me is exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| When we limit that down to just dismissals instead of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| hey, if we're going to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| then we should go back to the original intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| and then any action that was taken against you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| that you believe is for political purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| If a merit council hears it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| and five people or seven people that you've appointed say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| that's junk, then the employee's got to speak their thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| The next employee's got to see what the action is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| And it's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| You're not pushing it into court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| You're not making it litigious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| But probably the most important value of it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| you're not kind of creating a situation where the employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| if they have the courage to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| and say something in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| doesn't feel like they don't have any place to vent that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| or say that in a neutral area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| I blathered a lot on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| Hopefully I haven't lost you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| I'd be happy to answer any question I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| Thank you, Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7248)|
| 2:00:49| Commissioner Durant still has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| Mr. Taylor, so we do have some specific things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7251)|
| 2:00:56| that topics that can be heard as a grievance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| in front of the Merit System Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| A dismissal of employee under the procedure set out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| in the Merit System Board policy and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| Loss of salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| Suspension longer than three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| Denial of leave as set forth in Section 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| of the policies and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| And then requiring a classified employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| to participate in political activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| as a condition of employment or promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| So I did hear you speak to movement or transfers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| or loss of employment due to political activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7287)|
| 2:01:33| Now, do you mean specifically having to partake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| in a political, like this says participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| or just for political reasons in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| I would tell you any decision in today's workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| that is predicated on political grounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7307)|
| 2:01:52| that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7312)|
| 2:01:53| So, for instance, you have folks on the gamut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7313)|
| 2:01:59| of skills and abilities and employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| that you've trained at, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7321)|
| 2:02:04| the Sheriff's Office in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7324)|
| 2:02:07| You have gang investigators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| You have homicide investigators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| You have property crimes investigators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| And not to mention the fatality folks and all the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7334)|
| 2:02:20| And those are very accumulated skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| They take a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| They take building relationships with DAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| understanding the laws, all of those sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| So in my view, and the things that have been expressed to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7351)|
| 2:02:36| from, again, the folks that have reach out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7356)|
| 2:02:42| you don't want to handle employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7362)|
| 2:02:48| in a way that you've taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| they basically put their life into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| So there are guys that want to be motor cops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7372)|
| 2:02:55| and have worked their entire career to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| But even if it's a pay thing, even parity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| denying them that without some decent cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| is kind of, runs contrary to what you're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7384)|
| 2:03:10| as far as developing and retaining employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| And I have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| Commissioner Jay, is the only other major difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7400)|
| 2:03:26| between what was before us on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| and now what's before us on second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| the administration portion on page three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7411)|
| 2:03:34| where we have moved from the Merit System Board of Directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7414)|
| 2:03:38| and the Merit System staff personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| falling under Knox County HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7420)|
| 2:03:44| whereas now they report to the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| of the Merit System Board of Directors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| Yeah, the red line version is up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7429)|
| 2:03:51| that shows any changes from last version to this version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7431)|
| 2:03:54| Okay, so that's really the only major...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| Yeah, I think, well, there's one in 4252| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| and that's a language...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| There's a few cleanups throughout that we found, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7444)|
| 2:04:07| That's more...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| Oh, and the up to ten appointed positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| Yeah, we just changed the words his, her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| so it was the same description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| It just said his, so it was just a language catch on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| It was the same way last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| But the major tweaks to those would be the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7464)|
| 2:04:31| that you talked about with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| And I'm happy to address Mr. Taylor in the first section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| and then happy to address why that HR shift...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| Let me take the HR shift one first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| because that's a little bit easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7482)|
| 2:04:43| and then let me address the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| If it's okay, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7485)|
| 2:04:46| You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| The HR switch, we did have a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7488)|
| 2:04:52| with the senior director of HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7492)|
| 2:04:56| and sort of walked through that and made sure that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| you know, first and foremost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| we want to make sure that it makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| and that it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| That shifted, and I did reply to Mr. Moyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7505)|
| 2:05:09| and to Ms. Taylor on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7509)|
| 2:05:14| Regarding that, I'm just going to pull it up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| just to explain, again, because she manages the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| Ultimately, every Knox County employee needs oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| and needs someone to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| there are checks and balances along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| just like every employee does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| in the entire Knox County governmental system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7532)|
| 2:05:38| The higher merit system falls under commission's purview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| but I don't think it's appropriate for this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| to be directly involved with supervising employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| And when I say supervising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| that is the running of the day-to-day of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| that could be approving time off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| as we just had this big discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| It could also be sick time or leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| or roles and responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| all the functions of a normal HR policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| And so when I originally had it nested up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| under the HR department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| one thing that was really pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| is that senior director of Knox County HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| does not directly supervise employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7572)|
| 2:06:17| in the Parks and Rec Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| or the engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| They assist all of the departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| and ultimately it would also conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7584)|
| 2:06:27| if they were helping the sheriff's office do HR functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| and then they were managing this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| So it just didn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| And so this proposed structure basically says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| okay, like county commission, we have a staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7596)|
| 2:06:40| The chair oversees that staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| does personnel reviews, time off requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| making sure that the staff does the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| audit department same, there's other ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| that essentially the chair of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| would have that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| And then in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7614)|
| 2:06:55| it's pretty clear that what we're asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| is that chair of that board to give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| a report once a year on that staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7619)|
| 2:07:03| We ultimately have to make a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| We have to make a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| We have to add changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| And by having the help of the HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| from Knox County, it really brings resources in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| and it brings buy-in from both the legislative branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| and the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| A simple example of that is let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| they wanted a new piece of software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7643)|
| 2:07:24| to help with the HR onboarding process of new applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| We would have to approve that financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| but the executive branch and their HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7650)|
| 2:07:33| would want to assist in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7653)|
| 2:07:35| And so the chair of that board could come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| with that report in March and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| great, this year everything went well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| but we really need this piece of software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| My recommendation is that next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| you put in $100,000 to help, and we all have buy-in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7665)|
| 2:07:49| and then everybody sort of makes that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| So that's why the structure is different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| and I think that's more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| from the HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| That one's, like I said, a little bit easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| After meeting with Mr. Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7680)|
| 2:08:05| which, by the way, is not related to Ms. Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| who works in the marriage system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| There was some confusion there with some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| who called me and wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7691)|
| 2:08:16| Meeting with Mr. Taylor and some of the officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| we spent a lot of time on the transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7698)|
| 2:08:21| We're talking about the last page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7701)|
| 2:08:22| that outlines the grievances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7702)|
| 2:08:24| The first thing I'll say about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7704)|
| 2:08:26| before getting into my discussion thereafter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| with the law department is I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7708)|
| 2:08:32| it's as limiting as maybe was presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| A grievance is usually the last line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| in a series of things that happen from an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| separate of the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| So Officer Daley thinks that he was moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7726)|
| 2:08:52| from here to there or something happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| There's a chain of command of making complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| and that goes through several ranks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| before it gets to a sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| And then the merit system is sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| the last line of defense thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| And so there's a lot of steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| But also the normal, and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7749)|
| 2:09:13| Mr. Moyers, all of the things that apply to HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| in a state law policy still stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| So let's say somebody was sexually harassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| Let's say there were other HR issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| that somebody got fired for, could file a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7766)|
| 2:09:30| All of those things still exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| if I'm correct, in the sort of general HR world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7772)|
| 2:09:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7776)|
| 2:09:37| So there's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| This is directly related to what really comes down to transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| So I dug into transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| and in the policies and procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| you're correct, Commissioner Durrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| on page 21 there's two paragraphs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| that have to do with transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| I don't know when that was written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| who wrote it, when it was installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| It may have come before commission before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| I can't find any record of like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7803)|
| 2:10:06| we certainly didn't approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7806)|
| 2:10:08| So I don't know who wrote that or when that was in the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| That's not in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7810)|
| 2:10:12| That's in a policy and procedure document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| And so I posed this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| I said, well, why couldn't transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7816)|
| 2:10:19| let's say Officer Daley was transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7819)|
| 2:10:23| from his job as a detective to patrol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| because the sheriff said it was mission critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| and he thought it was political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| Why couldn't that be in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| And ultimately we went back to the original documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| that the merit system were founded on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| and it clearly and plainly states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| and I'm going to quote it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| the council shall provide as far as practical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| for the maximum flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| in lateral transfer of personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| particularly in those positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| and classes of positions relating to law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| Essentially, lateral transfers are at the discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| of the duly elected sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| So then we sort of dug in a little bit further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| and said, you know, what does that really mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| And how is it defined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| The merit system is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| well, let me skip that part for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| Allowing the merit system to review transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7876)|
| 2:11:19| and a transfer by definition is a move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| that does not decrease salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| So Officer Daley was making $60,000 as a detective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220718?start=7883)|
