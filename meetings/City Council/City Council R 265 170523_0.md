| 0:02:16| consent items are approved. For the Mayor's Report, I want to begin by recognizing yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=136)|
| 0:02:24| another person that we've lost two weeks ago. We talked about Mr. Raleigh Wynn and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| Mr. Bletner, actually, two community leaders that we lost. Well, we lost another champion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| of equality in our city last week with the passing of Mrs. Margaret Gator. I'm sure council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| members and many people in the audience and in the community knew her and their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| were touched by Mrs. Gator during her decades of public and community service. And I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| our thoughts and prayers are with all of her loved ones. Throughout her long life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| she showed that what matters is not only what you do, but how you do it. She and her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| husband Felix exhibited grace and determination, both personally and professionally, and often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| in the face of doubt and adversity. And she would regularly call April in our office with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| a list of items that we needed to take care of in her neighborhood or one of the organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| which she supported. And so she never, in fact, she just did it, I think, a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| weeks before she passed. She placed that call to April and made sure that we knew what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=207)|
| 0:03:33| needed to take care of. So we always look forward to those calls, actually, for Mrs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| Gator. She cared passionately about her community and her city. She never gave an inch when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| it came to doing what she knew was right, but her persistence came from kindness and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| empathy, never rancor. So we will all miss her very strong and steady voice. So this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=227)|
| 0:03:55| week is National Public Works Week. We have 525 employees that serve in our public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| departments, which include public service, engineering, parks and recreation, plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| review and inspections, and fleet services. These are some of our city's hardest workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| and without them, we wouldn't be able to function as a city. They often do thankless work, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| this week we are celebrating them in several ways. We have a social media campaign that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| follows individual employees on the job, and a blog series that highlights the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| that public works has on Knoxville's infrastructure. So please check out our city blog and on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| website and our social media accounts, our Facebook and our Twitter, and you can follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| along and help us celebrate National Public Works Week. Looking ahead, there will be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| public meeting next Thursday, June 1st, so a week from Thursday, June 1st, at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| at Lonsdale Elementary School to discuss the proposed Emerald Youth Sports Complex in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=290)|
| 0:04:57| Lonsdale neighborhood. I know there's a lot of excitement about that proposal, which we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| announced last month, and there are also still a lot of questions, although Emerald Youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| has been meeting with more and more people to try and address whatever questions or concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| people have. So, as we promised two weeks ago at public forum, we will hold a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| meeting and invite anyone, everyone to come and learn more about the proposal, answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| any questions. As we said before, there was a lot of misunderstandings and mischaracterizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| and we want to get all of that cleared up. I will be there, along with city staff and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| representatives from Emerald Youth, of course, invite everyone to come. Again, that is 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| p.m. on Thursday, June 1st, at Lonsdale Elementary School, which is at 1317 Louisiana Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=340)|
| 0:05:48| 1317 Louisiana Avenue. Finally, I want to remind everybody that next Monday, May 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=348)|
| 0:05:55| is Memorial Day, and city offices will be closed. Our residential trash and recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| pickup will run as usual on Monday, so if you have a Monday pickup, please remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| to put out your carts. I hope everybody enjoys the long weekend. That is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| Any council reports? Seeing, Councilman Campin. Thank you, Mayor. As part of the Leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=370)|
| 0:06:20| Knoxville class this year, I'd be remiss if I didn't invite everyone out to the Smoky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| Mountain Hoedown. That will be this Thursday. Everybody is invited. You can go to the Leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| Knoxville website for more information and to register, but you have to register. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| can't just show up with your boot-scooting boots on. Come on out. They're trying to raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| money for Aramont School of the Arts after the fires in Gatlinburg, and they're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| trying to break a record of the world's largest square dance. I think we've got to get over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| 1,400 people, so please come out and help the good cause. Thank you very much. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| other reports? We'll move on. 9A is an ordinance making and fixing the annual appropriations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=419)|
| 0:07:06| for the several departments, agencies, and funds of the City of Knoxville for the fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| year period beginning July 1, 2017 and ending June 30, 2018. So moved. Second. So this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=429)|
| 0:07:17| for the public, this is the second vote on the city budget. If this passes, then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| budget we proposed will be in effect come July 1. Councilman Delanoffi. Yeah, a quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=442)|
| 0:07:29| question. I see Jim York is here, and Jim, if you'll come on up. What I was interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| in was the next motion deals with the tax rate, the $2.73 per hundred assessed. We were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=456)|
| 0:07:44| talking in the weeks leading up to this budget of possibly borrowing the money for the LED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| lighting system, $17.5 million, or some portion of it. Will that affect the debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| and if so, do you know by approximately how much? It's like 53 cents of the $2.72 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| debt service, and I didn't know if that would have a significant bump or not much at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| Jim York, finance director. The amortization, I would guess, is going to run probably around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| 1.7, probably closer to 1.8 million per year. We anticipate that this... Less than a percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=496)|
| 0:08:28| then? I'm sorry. Yeah, in terms of the actual tax rate or the debt service. In terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=508)|
| 0:08:36| the way we're planning on structuring the debt, it's going to be probably a geo-debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=516)|
| 0:08:48| but we plan on using the money from the State Street Aid Fund, the savings that result from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| reduced energy costs to repay that debt. I heard Aaron say that we're going to recover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=535)|
| 0:09:03| that money over the course of 10 years or something less, that we will cut our operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| costs with those LED lights, which is a good investment. Right now, that's the plan, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=549)|
| 0:09:17| to probably issue with the geo-debt, but also have a secondary pledge of State Street Aid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| money, and that would be the savings that result from the energy savings. Which we anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| it will be about 2 million a year. Yeah, somewhere of 1.8 to 2 million a year. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| you'll pay the debt service through that at least? That's our plan. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| Thank you. Any other discussions? I know Council had a full day meeting on the budget, talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| to all of our department heads. So without any further discussion, we have a motion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=586)|

| 0:14:52| up, Mr. Seymour, and state your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| you have up to five minutes. Thank you, Mayor, members of Council. I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| 550 West Main Avenue. I am here on behalf of the applicant. The property involved is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=902)|
| 0:15:10| on Boyds Bridge Pike, just to the south of where Delrose intersects it, and Boyds Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=910)|
| 0:15:20| then goes across the river at that point. The property is presently occupied by a derelict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=920)|
| 0:15:28| service station that is being used as an alternator store. Mr. Dunaway has some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=928)|
| 0:15:38| information on that. The issue before you tonight is, can a Dollar General store locate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| in the zone which is C1, which is the city's neighborhood commercial zone? We have submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=945)|
| 0:15:53| a lengthy packet to the MPC, and I will not go through everything, or we would be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| for a while, and I also submitted a supplemental packet which the recorder distributed to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=960)|
| 0:16:08| all yesterday afternoon. To determine whether a Dollar General store would go in a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=968)|
| 0:16:17| commercial district, I think it's first we need to look at what is a C1 zone under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| the city ordinance. The general description says the district established is to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| areas in which the principal use of land is devoted to the neighborhood store. It is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| restricted commercial district limited to a narrow range of retail services and convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=996)|
| 0:16:43| goods only into the first floor of the structure. The district is designed for areas where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1003)|
| 0:16:50| large commercial operations are undesirable, but where individual proprietary stores are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| useful and desirable for the neighborhood. All right, what is a large retail store? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| would think of Walmart, Target, stores like that, most of which are in excess of 100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1024)|
| 0:17:12| square feet, obviously would not fit on the piece of property we're discussing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| tonight. A Dollar General store, its typical footprint is 9,100 square feet. If you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1038)|
| 0:17:27| at the city of Knoxville, I believe there are seven Walmarts in the city, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| six Target stores, and I'm including Knox County in that. There are 26 Dollar General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1052)|
| 0:17:40| stores, and they are adding hopefully one or two per year to that number. And why the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1060)|
| 0:17:48| difference in numbers? Because Dollar General stores target neighborhoods. They are designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1068)|
| 0:17:55| for people who live close by, many of whom can walk, ride the bus, or drive several blocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| to the store. And that is what this site offers. We got tied up in the BZA over whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1082)|
| 0:18:12| they were a drugstore or not. Well, what is a drugstore? The zoning ordinance does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| not define, but we are told when the zoning ordinance does not define what a drugstore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1098)|
| 0:18:28| is, then you go to Webster's Ninth Collegiate Dictionary, which defines a drugstore as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1108)|
| 0:18:36| retail store where medicines and miscellaneous articles, food, cosmetics, and film are sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1116)|
| 0:18:45| Dollar General sells medicines, aspirin, the whole ointments and things like that, anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1125)|
| 0:18:52| that does not require a prescription. They also sell birthday cards. They sell limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1132)|
| 0:18:59| food items. You have one minute, sir. Thank you. Milk and so forth. I think you really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1139)|
| 0:19:07| need to look at what can fit in the C1 neighborhood commercial. In the county, Dollar General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| fits in a neighborhood commercial zone there. According to the city, a CVS drugstore fits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1155)|
| 0:19:23| in a C1 zone, and their typical footprint is 14,000 to 15,000 square feet. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| urge you, I don't have time to give my complete appellate argument here, but I would urge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| you to read the memos, and I will now yield to the next speaker. Thank you. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| sir. Okay, Tim Dunaway. Please state your name and address for the record, and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1182)|
| 0:19:49| set the timer. Thank you for being here. Tim Dunaway, 717 East Bull Run Valley Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1189)|

| 0:20:06| in Tennessee and Virginia for the last four years, and I can tell you that the marketing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| and site selection process that they go through is all about finding locations that fit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| model. That's what they want. They look for communities and neighborhoods that have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| certain number of traffic counts, a certain number of rooftops within a radius, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| try to get located in a convenient, accessible spot in an intersection in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| Our Boyds Bridge site fits that bill very well. It's one lot off the intersection of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| Delrose with all those folks that live adjacent there, and also Boyds Bridge is a very strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| feeder from other adjacent neighborhoods. We've spoken with the Delrose Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| Watch folks that are closest and directly adjacent to the site. Their representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| wrote to me that they're very excited about this coming. There were several things they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| mentioned. The other businesses in the area, the elementary school staff, there's a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| adult home in that area, a nursing home, but also just the residents are happy to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| potentially a clean, well-lit store near this corner. She also mentioned that there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1259)|
| 0:21:06| possibility that the cameras that would be there for the Dollar General, the security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| cameras, would be advantageous for them for crime control, missing persons, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| She's also a member of Riverview Baptist Church, which is one lot away from our property, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| she said those folks at the church are also very excited about having a place to go run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| to for quick supplies and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| We've also met with and spoke with Town Hall East in the Holston Hills neighborhood. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| went back and forth with them several times via email. They gave us a list of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| they would require before they would consider approving the project, which they have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| done yet, but we have sent drawings back responding to, I forget, the original list had eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| or ten items on it, and we have six or eight of those met. There's a couple that we won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| be able to do, but I'm sure they'll speak to that, but we have been meeting with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| We are going to be adding a full brick masonry veneer to the prototype to make it more in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| keeping with the neighborhood, timer-controlled full cut-off lighting to reduce any light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| spillover from the property to the neighborhood, a lot of additional landscaping, irrigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| to help soften the building up to the residential background, a full new sidewalk across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| frontage, which, of course, the city probably would have required that anyway, but we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| be doing that along with some additional landscaping along the front. Also, there'll be full pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| and handicap accessibility from the road to the front door of the store. Dollar General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| is very receptive to providing these types of items to help fit in with zoning requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| and neighborhood associations because the neighbors are their customers. They want that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| to happen, and they're also very glad for us to spend that money because we're the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| and we get to foot that bill, and we're glad to do it, too. It gets our project off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| ground. We get to go build our building, and the neighborhood gets a store that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| really use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| Again, the types, the languages that have been discussed before, you know, C-1 encourages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| food markets, baked goods, delicatessen, bakery, stationery, all those types of uses, pharmaceutical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| goods, gifts, clothing items, and of course those are understood to be under the umbrella| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| of individual proprietary stores, but all those goods are under one roof in this 9,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| square foot store, and as Arthur has pointed out, there's, you know, a CVS that is 12,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| to 14,000 square foot that's been approved in the C-1, very much the same sort of assorted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| goods that are for sale there, big difference being that prescription drugs are not sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| at Dollar General, but all the other things are very similar in use. We understand and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| we respect that the C-1 zoning is, the language is intended for that proprietary small mom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| and pop type of store, but if it's not had the desired effect on that particular spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| for a period of time, you'll have seen the pictures of what's there, the seller has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| indicated to me that the alternator shop is probably not going to be there much longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| so there'll be another vacant building there in that little corner. Instead of that happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| we would like to provide a clean, well-lit, well-patronized store which is very close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| to what the original intent was, we feel, and will help inject a little vitality to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| this neighborhood and probably make it more likely for additional new neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| development to be drawn to this area. The zoning language calls for a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| store that is useful and desirable for the neighborhood. I really think that this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| fits that bill and will be well-received and appreciated by the residences and business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| there. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Now we'll hear from Mr. Tim Hill. Thank you for being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1470)|
| 0:24:37| here. Please state your name and address for the record. Thank you. My name is Tim Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| 311 South Wise Garber, 37919. Many of you are familiar with me, so I think I ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| clear the record by saying I have no financial interest in this matter and really no agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| other than to speak about the community of which I was raised. I grew up just over Boyd's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1495)|
| 0:25:03| Bridge called the Ramsey Community, and this particular commercial corridor is the, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1503)|
| 0:25:11| would say, the intersection of where rural people meet urban people, and the common theme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1511)|
| 0:25:19| that they have is economic disadvantage, for the biggest part. And let me say it's on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1519)|
| 0:25:26| outer fringes of Holston Hills, and there's a clear distinction of what is Holston Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| and this commercial corridor here. I remember growing up, we had two service stations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| The particular property in discussion here was Abmay's filling station, and right next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| to it was Frank Harman's Food Mart. Frank Harman's Food Mart has been demolished, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| then we had the Holiday Market just to the east of it, Odie Brown's Holiday Market, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| has been demolished as well. And then we had, some of you remember Hamilton Burnett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| he had a service station at the corner of Delrose and Boyd's Bridge Pike. And there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1564)|
| 0:26:12| has been no new investment in this community since 1971, when Frank Harman left this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1572)|
| 0:26:22| property and went over and built at the other intersection at Delrose and Boyd's Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1582)|
| 0:26:30| Pike. It is now what I would call a third rate market, one which many people would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1590)|
| 0:26:38| patronize. So I think any investment in this community is a benefit. Not to mention, well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1598)|
| 0:26:47| maybe I will mention, over 40 acres of a landfill that is rising into a mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| directly behind this property, a construction landfill. So this community is in dire need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1614)|
| 0:27:02| and I'll tell you, many people, there is a void in this community for services. Many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| people, they do not have transportation, and they walk to the market, and the only option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| they have there is that what was formerly known as Harman's Food Mart, the second version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1634)|
| 0:27:21| of Harman's Food Mart. So I'm sure, I know that many support this in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| They're over there trying to survive and eke out a living, and many don't have transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| to come to City Council, nor they may not even be aware that we have a City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| And that's not to say that all people are ignorant over there, but they are challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| educationally and economically, and I would certainly like to see this. And I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| reason that we're here and debating this issue tonight is because we have a poorly, very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| poorly written C1 language in our zoning. And I want to hand it to the City that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1672)|
| 0:28:00| looks like we're going to fix much of our zoning woes, because they are archaic, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| they're not very specific. And you can hang on language in this C1 and talk about individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| proprietorship, and you can talk about services that are desirable for the community, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| I think you could argue both sides of this issue and never fully resolve it. I've talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| to Peter Ahrens about this, and we've had quite a bit of discussion about it. Peter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| has an opinion. I will tell you it is my opinion that he is not convicted of that opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| because I think he sees that it is a poorly written ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| Some of the roads that I want to speak to in this last minute are roads that are clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| economically challenged. Not all of them. And we can talk about Holston Hills Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| There are two sides to Holston Hills Road, and there's a clear distinction. There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| south side that we always call Riverside Drive. It turns into Riverside Drive, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| it looks nothing economically like the north side of Holston Hills Road. There are other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1749)|
| 0:29:17| roads, such as the Ramsey Community, River Shores Estates. There are over a hundred homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| just across the river, and there are just no stores that provide the services. But there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| are many like the Saramore Green area, McDonnell Road, Brooks Road, Riverside Drive. I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| go on. Andes Road. I could go on and on and tell you these folks need more services in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1774)|
| 0:29:42| that community. And thank you for the time, and I ask for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Okay, now the respondents. I have Doug Topenberg and Rich. Is it Rich? Nelson. Yeah. Mr. Topenberg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1789)|
| 0:29:57| please state your name. Topenberg. I'm sorry. Mr. Topenberg. I knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| My name is Doug Topenberg. I live at 5918 Holston Hills Road. I'm appearing here as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| the president of Town Hall East, which is a neighborhood association recognized by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| the city's Office of Neighborhoods. Our members reside in Holston Hills, Chilhowee Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| Burlington area, Boyds Bridge, and other communities in east Knoxville. Gentlemen earlier, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1822)|
| 0:30:32| misstated Town Hall East's position on this. Our board has unanimously voted that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| is an inappropriate use of this property. This is a retail establishment, and it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1839)|
| 0:30:46| not appropriate for a C1 designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1846)|
| 0:30:56| The point I would like to make is that east Knoxville is a fragile environment. We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| trying very hard to maintain these neighborhoods and actually to elevate them when possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1861)|
| 0:31:10| But there is creeping decay coming into this area. Holston Hills was once a jewel of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| neighborhood on a par with Sequoia Hills. It's still a very nice neighborhood, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| we have decay that moves in closer and closer every year. Mr. Hill is suggesting that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1883)|
| 0:31:34| folks there are economically and educationally challenged, that somehow that justifies putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1894)|
| 0:31:41| in a store that is going to emphasize that rather than putting in something that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1901)|
| 0:31:48| be more appropriate, such as a food market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1908)|
| 0:31:55| We could debate all evening whether or not this business is desirable in this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| but the simple fact is that it is not on the list of permitted uses, and it is not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1922)|
| 0:32:12| on the list of uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| Somehow, I guess the argument is being made that because they sell potato chips and a few other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1939)|
| 0:32:28| forms, candy and so forth, that they're a food market. That doesn't make a food market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| We need a place there that sells fresh produce, that sells a wide variety of healthy food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1953)|
| 0:32:41| not just junk food. The other argument, reading through the packet, is apparently that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| supposed to be a drugstore because they sell over-the-counter medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| The definition, however, of drugstores include, there are five subcategories of it, book and reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1974)|
| 0:33:04| matter, stationary, tobacco, vanity goods, and pharmacy. There is not a pharmacy, and I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1984)|
| 0:33:14| that anyone would, any reasonable mind would come to the conclusion that a drugstore is someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=1994)|
| 0:33:23| that sells only over-the-counter medicine, and not that much of it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| Finally, I'd like to say that one of the speakers indicated that this was only 9,000 square feet versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2009)|
| 0:33:42| the size of a Walmart or a Target. 9,000 square feet is a huge space going into a small lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| and it is going to change the whole character of this neighborhood if we allow it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2029)|
| 0:34:04| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| Mr. Hill indicated that this is a zone of economic distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2047)|
| 0:34:16| The gentleman from Dollar General Store said that Dollar General targets certain neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2056)|
| 0:34:23| and I think put those together, and we feel like we're the victim of a store coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2063)|
| 0:34:31| taking advantage of the decay in our neighborhood, and we would ask the court to deny this, or the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Thank you, Mr. Toppenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| Okay, next, Rich Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| Please state your name and address for the record, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| Yes, my name is Rich Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| I live at 5212 Daphne Drive, and Mayor and Councilmember, thank you for letting me speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| This is going to be very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| I have read the C-1 ordinance and the Board of Zoning Appeals transcript denying Dollar General's appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2103)|
| 0:35:10| This is what I concluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| A Dollar General store is too large and sells too many different things to be permitted in the C-1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2112)|
| 0:35:21| Lastly, and very importantly, letting this store be built on the Boyds Bridge Pike site would render all C-1 designations in Knoxville meaningless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2121)|
| 0:35:34| Please deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| Okay, we have up to two minutes for Mr. Seymour to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| C-1 has a definition in it that says it is a retail service area in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| Dollar General is a retail service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| I would submit in response to Mr. Toppenberg's argument that this would arrest some creeping decay in this little area where the Trans or Alternator store is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2158)|
| 0:36:18| This would be new investment in that area and would help that area and perhaps encourage on the other retail lots there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2178)|
| 0:36:31| and it's not a big area, but on the other retail lots, that there would be some development that would be appropriate for them also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2191)|
| 0:36:41| I think Mr. Toppenberg indicated that Dollar General was targeting lower income neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2201)|
| 0:36:52| They do that, but they target everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| The Wall Street Journal reports that 25% of their customers, not only Dollar General but the other dollar stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2215)|
| 0:37:03| have an annual household income of over $100,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| These dollar stores target neighborhoods of every type, and this is a good neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2229)|
| 0:37:16| You have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| With Holston Hills right there and the other areas that Mr. Hill referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| it will target only local customers who come from a very short distance away and fits the C-1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2243)|
| 0:37:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Okay, Council, that's all of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| I see Peter Ahrens is in the audience, and maybe he can come up and talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| Specifically, Mr. Ahrens, I'm troubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| I read the C-1 zone, and it looks like we're talking about small individual stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| whether it's a bakery or some other service that's provided to a neighborhood, a barber shop, a beauty shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2274)|
| 0:38:01| Kate mentioned cleaning and pressing facilities under 4,000 square feet, half the size of this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2281)|
| 0:38:08| This sounds more like a department store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| It has, I mean, I saw Mr. Seymour's presentation before the BZA, and it talks about it has a little gift shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2290)|
| 0:38:19| It has a little food, junk food stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| It has a little over-the-counter medicine but no pharmacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| and he tried to combine them all into one operation that strikes me as more of a department store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| Would you tell us how you looked at C-1 and how you made your distinction that this was more general retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| than it was a specialty shop that serves a small area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| I think you hit the nail on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| The general description talks of individual proprietary stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| and the uses permitted are examples of said proprietary stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| As we looked into this, we did look to see where this type of operation would fit most effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2337)|
| 0:39:05| and if you look at C-3, the general commercial district, it talks of retail establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2345)|
| 0:39:13| including incidental manufacturing of goods for sale at retail on the premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| It doesn't get into the very specific proprietary stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| It's a general retail district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| And so that's really what we hung our hat on is the vast difference between C-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| where it speaks of the individual stores and proprietary stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| versus the general description associated with the C-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| I notice that there's at least three dollar generals in the area, one on Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| one on Asheville Highway, and one on John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| Those seem to be more major type roads that are carters that are meant to move a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2389)|
| 0:39:59| We've got a small sort of community road going through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| and this place is going to have, what, 9,000 square feet and 30 parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| and is designed to move a lot of product in a big store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| Do you look at that, or is that not pertinent to your C-1 analysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| Well, the C-1 would not be on one of those more highly traveled roads that you're speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| All of the other dollar general stores would have been located in something other than C-1, most likely C-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| I would imagine Mr. Seymour would know that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| I haven't looked into the other locations specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| but I can tell you that we have been consistent in our enforcement of the C-1 zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| Well, I drive that road every day, and I know that there are very low traffic counts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| and I assume that this will be more of a busy store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| I'm just wondering, does anyone look at that in plans review, or we never got that far in this particular case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| I don't think that happens during the plan review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| I think that happens during the zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| During the zoning process, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| Did you hear anything tonight that caused you to change your opinion that this is too high a usage to be a neighborhood commercial C-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| Anybody else on council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| I need a motion to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| Okay, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Concerning the, I guess Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| Can you speak in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| How many jobs would be there at this dollar store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| Tim, do you know. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| Generally upwards of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| It's not a huge store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Six jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Other than a lot of business that's generated by supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| And then this. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Come on up here, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| You need to get the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| Yeah, it's not a lot of jobs, but it is a lot of. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| Six jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2510)|

| 0:42:03| .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| They have a full grocery selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| It's healthy food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| They've expanded their refrigeration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| and freezer capacities so people can go there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| and get milk, eggs, butter, without going to the big stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| That's what these. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| It's a lot more improved than what people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| in their minds about dollars generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| And there's also small neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| So there will be fresh fruits and vegetables in this store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| Not fresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Not what you're talking about, like the grocery store would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| certainly not, they're not big enough to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| Okay, well I just want to be clear on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| Plenty of canned fruits and vegetables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| meats, dry goods, grocery type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| Thank you, a few months ago we were hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| from people on Amherst about a dollar general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| that was going into the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| and it seemed that the sky was gonna fall in for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| and the dollar general was constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| it is open and it is flourishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| and the sky's still in the sky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| I think that this will be a positive step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| for this particular neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| that we're talking about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| Dollar general meets needs that other stores don't meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| and I really think that the availability and convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| for this particular neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| would be a really healthy thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| and I will be supporting the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| What is the, I don't know if maybe Gerald Green has this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| what is the road classification of Boyd's Bridge Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| No, I'm sorry, I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Okay, Peter, do you know what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| Do you know what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| I don't know, I mean, I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| It's probably a collector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| which would be below an arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| and be suitable for the C1 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| and again, to reiterate what Peter said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| the C1 is designed for smaller community stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| not larger, more traffic generating stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| There's, you know, there's no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| other than a small convenience store that's there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| there's no development in the C1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| So it's either, and nothing new there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| this building that's there is certainly on its way down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| and probably of very little use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2668)|
| 0:44:28| You couldn't put a filling station back where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| You know, today's drugstore is called for in C1 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| is a lot different than the drugstore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| that this was written for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| And when you had a neighborhood drugstore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| it was a specialty store and a drugstore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| But today's drugstore is about 15,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| multiple, all kinds of merchandise from certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2690)|
| 0:44:57| all, you know, from beach chairs to beach balls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| to just about anything that you want from film.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| And, you know, so this, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| today's drugstore is CVS is as much as a general store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| as anything is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| And if it is appropriate in a C1 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| then I have to believe that a Dollar General store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| that's selling food, beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| we had a beer request tonight for front of beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| for a Dollar General store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| You know, it's a, that's what's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| and it will drive economic development in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| on that strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| And, you know, I think it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| I don't think you see anybody else able to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| on that spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| I think it's a probably a very good location for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| They've applied, apparently they've agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| to the concessions, making it all brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| We've had other Dollar General store developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| before us that have tried to meet these requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| and have been asked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| This one, they're applying the all brick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| additional lighting, landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| trying to make it fit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| I mean, they're trying to make it work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| and they're trying to do economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| in a tough place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| So I think in this case, you know, I support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| And I think it's for the better of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| to have a brand new all brick retail store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| down that corner where it's been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| where it's really blighted property at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| So I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| Just your response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| Thank you, Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| I drove out there and took a look at the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| and I understand what George is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| and same thing with Brenda in terms of how it could help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| And so I do have mixed feelings about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| in terms of what could happen as far as fixing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| But the problem that I have is the C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| In other words, if we approve this for C1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| for this particular location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| what are we gonna do on down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| in terms of other C1 areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| So as far as the zoning goes, I have difficulty with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| And I would ask author, excuse me, Mr. Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| did you not consider asking for a C3 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| instead of trying to get an appeal on a C1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| We did and my initial discussions with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| was this was not an appropriate area for a C3 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| So I'd probably be here on an appeal from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| That they did not, the zoning was already C1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2844)|
| 0:47:31| it's a very small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| C3 might open it up to uses that would not be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| So I was just gonna ask Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| I was gonna ask you about the C1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| and the possibility of what this does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| for other areas in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| There I would agree first with Mr. Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| that the C1 zoning district is poorly written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| and to respond to something Councilman Wallace said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| that given the type of drug store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| find it challenging to call a CVS a drug store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| It's more general store that if the C1 zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| were written today, it would likely have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| square footage standards in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| which would limit the size of stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| as opposed to antiquated listing of permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| Opening this up, the C1 district up to the store this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| would open it up to basically medium box stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| throughout the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| and is that what we want in our C1 zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| The C1 zone should be a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| that would promote small entrepreneurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| startup businesses and those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| which serve the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| as opposed to the broader community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| Well is your vision then that as we go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| the reworking of the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| is your vision that C1 should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| just what you said it should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| instead of allowing say a Dollar General store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| or stores of that type or that size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| or even CVS or Walgreens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| That would be my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| That it stays small?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| The C1 serves small, provide an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| for the small businesses which serve the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| and are limited in square footage size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| maybe not so much in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| get away from the use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| especially given the challenges it's causing now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| but put standards in to assure that those uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| continue to serve the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| as opposed to the broader community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Would that be a CVS or a Walgreens in your future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| Not in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| Okay, that's what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Not given the nature of CVSs and Walgreens today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| which again tend to be more general store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| than a drug store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| Would that apply to Dollar General?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| If they could do a smaller square footage store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| then that might work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| So again, the thing that I'm concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| is where we are today in terms of what our zoning is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| and what a C1 does and are we opening the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| We would open the door to others across the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| Thank you Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| Obviously some good arguments on both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| and as to the economic argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| I mean there's probably a lot of good things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| that might be good for the economy there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| but that's really not the issue before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| The issue is, is this use compatible with the C1 zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| And it's a tough call but I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| I think you have to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| the other C1 zone properties in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| There's not a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| But I think there's some in Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| there's some in Innskip, like downtown Vestal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| Tazewell Pike, I think there's some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Anyway, so that's the way I think of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| and if you think that dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| general stores should be permitted in all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| then it's probably easy to support the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| but I kind of keep going back to the sentence in the C1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| this district is designed for areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| where large commercial operations are undesirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| but where individual proprietary stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| are useful and desirable for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| I think with that, and I think that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| I agree with Mr. Green and Mr. Ahrens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| that this just doesn't fit that definition in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3077)|
| 0:51:25| so I would move to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Okay, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| Yeah, I think it's one last thing that you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| in order to develop, for this corner to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| as a retail center, as you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| for someone to put in a small proprietary store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| somebody's gotta build the store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| and it's gotta make economic sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| So you gotta buy the land, you gotta build the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| and you gotta get enough rent to be able to pay the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| and pay the owner a return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| And obviously it hadn't happened yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| I mean, so the advantage of a dollar general store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| in this case is they've got the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| to drive the business, to pay enough rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| and to pay the owner and pay for the improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| So in those cases, other places where there are C1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| you've got buildings that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| I mean, down in Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| you've got buildings that are already there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| that could be combined into 7,000 square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| I mean, for sure, or 9,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| So in this case, it's barren land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| that the cost to develop is a lot steeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| with no buildings on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| no usable buildings on it, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| So I think you gotta consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| Okay, is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| Before us is a motion to deny the appeal of dollar general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3167)|

| 0:52:51| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3173)|
| 0:52:53| Yes, just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| Councilman Pavlis has asked that we explain the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| So if you vote aye on this particular motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| you will be voting to deny the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| to deny the use of this parcel for the dollar general store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| If you vote no, you'll vote essentially in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| of the appeal of the dollar general store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| Anybody have any questions about which way you vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| depending on how you feel about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| Say it one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Well, I was just gonna say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| to add to the string that you were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| if you vote aye on this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| it means you're denying the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| you're upholding the BZA and Peter Aaron's analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| of what fits and doesn't fit in C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| So an aye means you support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| what the neighborhood said and Peter Aaron's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| You vote no if you support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| dollar general's position on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3230)|

| 0:54:26| So now I can entertain another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| Because we have to have a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3271)|

| 0:57:33| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| to execute an agreement with SCU Bus Lines LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3458)|

| 0:57:46| Parks and Recreation Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| for a total contract amount not to exceed $40,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| Yes, I had one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| I think I probably answered my own question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| but there's been a lot of discussion about seatbelts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| Will this line have to have, or are we requiring seatbelts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3482)|
| 0:58:09| Our Parks and Rec Director, Joe Walsh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| will respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| Joe Walsh, Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| Councilman Brown, these buses probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| will not have seatbelts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| We're following basically the same standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| that the Knox County schools follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| regarding their bus services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| All right, thank you for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3508)|
| 0:58:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| 11G is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| to enter into a contract with Anderson Lumber Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| Incorporated for the demolition, repair, and replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| of the roofing system at the former sanitary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| laundry, and dry-cleaning facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| located at 625 North Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| for an amount not to exceed $507,142.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3535)|
| 0:58:55| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Yeah, I see Anne Wall is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| and Mr. Hageman's here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| I asked this on the telephone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| but I still need a better explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| why a roof costs $500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| for this old commercial building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| It seems like a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| and I can't help but observe that a spec sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| that has 250 pages of requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| might have scared off some bidders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| Is that a lot of money for the square footage of roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| or what are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| That's what troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Anne Wallace, Deputy Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| Office of Redevelopment, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Happy to answer your question, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| First and foremost, I should mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| that we did have an independent contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| with Kennedy, I'm sorry, Christopoulos Kennedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| go out and investigate the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| and provide an estimate for the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| associated with repairing and replacing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| this roof structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| It is obviously built from the 19, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| teens when the building was originally constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| and the spans that are-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| Bad shape, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| It's in bad shape, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| Significantly so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| Unfortunately, since the company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| the dry cleaning company left in the late 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| it went through a variety of ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| until it was owned previously by Ira Scott Brady,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| and unfortunately, the roof was not maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| in that 20-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| So we inherited a roof that was failing in many places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| and in fact, has subsequently collapsed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| in another portion of the roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| since we obtained ownership through the tax sale process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| With that said, the original estimate for the roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| to be able to remediate and repair this roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| does have both asbestos-containing material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| and lead-based paint included in the materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| The original estimate was $800,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| for a 16,000-square-foot roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| and that was to repair and replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| Again, what we saw when we put this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| we went through several iterations and several steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| to make sure that the contractors were well-prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| so that they understood the environmental risks associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| so that the folks who are working on this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| are safe throughout the duration of construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| and also the fact that they will have to coordinate work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| with our environmental contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| who will be doing remediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| in the lower portion of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| and probably at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| the two contracts will run concurrently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| With that being said, we were very confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| in the number that we received back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| being $500,000 and $507,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| given that all three bids that were received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| were within $50,000 of each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| so less than a 10% difference for that entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| And we did have several walkthroughs available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| for contractors who participated in the bid process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| so the folks knew what they were getting into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| when they made their bids, so I feel very confident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| and of course, our purchasing agent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| feels very confident in this number as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| Another question is, what do you end up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| at the end of the day when you've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| I guess the remediation is EPA grant money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| but we all pay those taxes too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| but you got a $500,000 roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| what is this site worth when it's all fixed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| Sure, and the short answer is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| whatever someone will pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| The longer answer is very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| What do you think that is, is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| Legitimately, I think we have two things to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| You have a property that the city has inherited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| that is a liability for adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| and there are two viable businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| on either side of this structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| The Knox Heritage Salvage Stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| as well as the former headquarters of BESCO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| that is being used for other employment services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| at this time, so there are two viable businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| directly next door that are definitely impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| by the lack of use of this structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| Subsequently, you also have to look at the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| that it would cost almost as much to raise this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| and remediate the site so that it could be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| for something else in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| So what we're getting is a great historic building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| that's been identified by Knox Heritage on multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| on the Fragile 15 list that was a major employment center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| for the city of Knoxville in the downtown north area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| and it puts 32,000 square feet of usable building space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| back into the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| So at the end of the day, I can't tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| I don't have a crystal ball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| exactly what the property would sell for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265170523?start=3785)|
