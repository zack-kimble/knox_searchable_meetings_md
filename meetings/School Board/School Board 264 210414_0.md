| 0:02:00| And I'd like to refer to Superintendent Thomas for his remarks this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=120)|
| 0:02:06| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| We're here this evening with heavy hearts in the wake of the tragic events that took place at Austin High School on Monday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=130)|
| 0:02:18| I continue to be deeply saddened by this horrible event and my heart goes out to the students, families and employees of Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=138)|
| 0:02:27| No student or school employee should ever have to worry about their day being interrupted by such awful violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| As TBI works to determine exactly what happened on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| I do want to again offer my thoughts and prayers to the families of Anthony Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| I also think it's very important to remember that this incident on Monday was the fifth time that an Austin East student has fallen victim to gun violence in recent months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=162)|
| 0:02:53| This is a terrible burden to bear and my heart goes out to the families and friends of Justin, Stanley, Janaria, Jamarian and Anthony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=173)|
| 0:03:03| The Roadburner family is hurting and we're hurting with them and I want to thank Principal Nathan Langlois and the employees of Austin East for the courage and strength that they have shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=183)|
| 0:03:12| They love their students and they care deeply about their well-being and I'm grateful to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| We do have counselors available for anyone who needs assistance and I would encourage the entire Austin East community to reach out if you need support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=198)|
| 0:03:27| I also want to reiterate something I've said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| We simply must find a community solution to the issue of gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| We cannot continue to ask our students and school employees to deal with the awful fear that comes with these terrible incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=216)|
| 0:03:44| Knox County Schools cannot solve this problem alone, but we stand ready to work with all stakeholders to take action and to bring change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=224)|
| 0:03:54| In closing, I do want to say that Austin East will not have classes on Thursday, Friday or Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| Students will move to virtual learning on Tuesday, April 20th and return to the school building on Wednesday, April 21st unless otherwise notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=239)|
| 0:04:09| Our hope is that this pause will give students and employees additional time to begin the healing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=249)|
| 0:04:17| Madam Chair, I appreciate the chance to speak and I want to thank all board members for their support during this trying time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| Okay, and now we move to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| Excuse me, Madam Chair, I don't know if my light works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Is it working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Superintendent Thomas, if you don't mind adding to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| Because I know this will be our only public forum before Wednesday comes, when the kids come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| So can you give some type of assurance to parents what the plan is, the conversation, so that they feel comfortable sending their kids back to school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=287)|
| 0:04:55| Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| We actually had a meeting with Principal Langlois this morning and in looking at what we have done, the things that we have done up to this point certainly continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=297)|
| 0:05:08| I know we improved our camera, upgraded our camera system and added additional cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| We've also added additional school security officers, KPD, law enforcement presence is at the school and around the school at arrival and dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=313)|
| 0:05:25| In addition to that, clear backpacks have also been implemented at Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| Our discussion this morning centered primarily around additional measures that could be taken in terms of random searches, beginning with the return to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=330)|
| 0:05:43| So we're continuing to have those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| I've also asked Mr. Oaks to look into an additional security measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| I don't feel comfortable talking publicly about that, but an additional security measure in terms of securing the school at all times during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=352)|
| 0:06:03| So we'll have more information about that as Mr. Oaks is able to do his research there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| Again, we're also meeting with law enforcement, I believe Mr. Oaks is that Friday, to debrief and to look at what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=370)|
| 0:06:20| Are there any additional measures, anything that we're overlooking or have overlooked that we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| Again, in terms of a long-range plan for Austin East, we have some ideas about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=385)|
| 0:06:33| It's going to require some additional resources and my recommendation, we'll talk a little bit more about that later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| but my recommendation to the board would be to make sure that we apply those additional resources that we have talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=400)|
| 0:06:48| I keep saying, you know, we need action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| I don't want that to be just words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| I want us to make sure that we do our part and that there is action on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| I've talked with Mayor Kincannon, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| We'll continue to have conversations because it's a broader issue than just Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| but we do play an important part in that and there are some things that we need to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| curricular kinds of things or program kinds of things we need to be doing, maybe in some of our other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| I want to make sure that that happens, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| We just can't continue to have these tragedies happen in the Austin East community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=444)|
| 0:07:34| I don't know if I've addressed Ms. Satterfield, but I just want to assure families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| and it's so difficult to sit here and say we're going to ensure your safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| and then right on the heels of an event where a child dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| I really don't have words to describe how I feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| I've tried to do the best I can to verbalize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| It's weighed heavily on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| It's weighed heavily on me since January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| You know, and we can only take so much, you know, if we've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| I appreciate the board listening and I appreciate the board for supporting the plan that we're going to come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| We have got to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas. Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| We'll move into changes to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| Board members, you received an email yesterday regarding a time-sensitive agreement with the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| for Knox County Schools' use of the Christenberry Recreation Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| That agreement has been added as item 10D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| Without objection, I am switching the order of items 10C and 10D on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=526)|
| 0:08:53| so that our discussion and possible action on COVID protocols for next school year will be the last item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=533)|
| 0:09:02| Also, since they are relating to topics around our COVID protocols and activities going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| I'm requesting that items 7D and 7E, which are Ms. Henderson's proposed amendments to the face coverings policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=547)|
| 0:09:15| and a new policy regarding student activities, be moved to follow the last items as items 10E and 10F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=555)|
| 0:09:25| So we will move that conversation to the end of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| And those three, two policies and one agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Just for clarity, so we're moving basically 10C down and then we'll have the policies move with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=576)|
| 0:09:46| So 10C will go to the very end of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| and then the two policies, D and E, will move so that we discuss those after we discuss what is currently 10C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=589)|
| 0:10:02| the possible action and protocols related to COVID-19. Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| Okay, so you're wanting to do 10C first and then the policies following that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| The policies will be the very last things we can talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| I think that probably would be the best way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| Okay, I just wanted some clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| Okay, let me see if I have anything else. Okay, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=621)|
| 0:10:28| I'm sorry, I'm just clarifying too. So current 10C will be 10D and 9D will be E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=628)|
| 0:10:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| Oh, not 9, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| 10D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Sorry, 7, 7, 7E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| So right, so basically when we get to board policies, we will skip over 10 or 7, sorry, 7D and E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=647)|
| 0:10:55| and we will then move those to the, so that we have those after the discussion and possible action on protocols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=655)|
| 0:11:05| related to COVID-19 for the 21-22 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| And then before we get to that conversation though, when we have 10D up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| which is the City of Knoxville thing that's been added, do that first, then go into that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| Does that sound okay? All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| So do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| With a motion by Ms. Christie, do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| A second by Mr. Watson. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| Okay, thank you. Thank you for your flexibility on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| I think that will be helpful in our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| Okay, now I would like to refer to Superintendent Thomas for his remarks on our special recognition this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=706)|
| 0:11:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| It's always a pleasure to recognize our employees for their achievements and the excellent work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=716)|
| 0:12:04| And is Ms. Callahan-Mims here with us this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| Yes, please move to the lectern right there, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| Or come on up front on the stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| Be the celebrity. No, you can stand right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| We're going to join you here in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| You're fine right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=738)|

| 0:19:39| Ms. Bounds, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| We actually have a speaker on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| I'm going to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| I mean, I'm going to let Ms. Coatney come up and speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| Is this where you're wanting to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| I mean, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Tanya Coats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Tanya Coats, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| So I was wanting to talk about this last week in regards to thinking about these COVID paid leave days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1212)|
| 0:20:20| We would really appreciate your approval of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| As the superintendent and I have discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| So I know most of you may know or may not know that this federal government decided to not extend COVID leave days in the middle of a pandemic, which is unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1228)|
| 0:20:39| And so when we were talking about last week in regards to if we should have face coverings or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| I don't think the general public really knows that educators, if they contracted COVID or they were quarantined, that they must take on their own sick days and take them out of their own personal days that they have accumulated themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1246)|
| 0:21:00| And so the money that came from our federal government, they always put these mandates on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| They always say that you can't use it for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| You can use it for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| But knowing that we were trying to do what's best for every student in this district, that we as educators came back and had to use our own days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1270)|
| 0:21:19| Now, we know that it's not like an astronomical number, but it's unfortunate that we had to take days that we had accumulated of our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| So when you're thinking about this line item, just knowing that all the safety measures that you have had in place, if you didn't have the constant cleaning on a weekly and daily basis at schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1287)|
| 0:21:42| if you didn't implement the social distancing that is regarded by the CDC, or you didn't have options for families to actually do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1302)|
| 0:21:53| you would have had a lot higher number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| You can ask Mr. Scott Bolton, or you can ask Mr. McPherson, that we would have had a number of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1315)|
| 0:22:03| If you compare it to those that when we first started in the fall semester, that we had several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| At one point, I remember us talking at a school board meeting that there were over 2,500 staff members that were out either on quarantine or they contracted COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1329)|
| 0:22:20| Now, just think, equate that to if you had to actually, we didn't have the money that the federal government gave us in the first semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1340)|
| 0:22:28| I asked you to continue to keep these measures in place, to continue to keep staff safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| You have heard all over this nation where teachers have refused, refused to come back to work because there were no safety measures put in place to ensure that not only that the kids are safe in school, but their own families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1354)|
| 0:22:49| We have educators that are in our system that, like myself, have underlying conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| It's not by that I chose to do this, but some of these are based on family measures, meaning that I have family members, I have people in my family that have cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1376)|
| 0:23:08| I have family members that have diabetes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| Excuse me, if we can just stick, because it is a voting meeting, to what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| Yeah, it's about the 10 COVID days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Yeah, this is about the 10 COVID days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Because teachers have actually taken this out of their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| If they have to pay it out of their pocket, it's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| So we're asking you to consider to pass this measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| So it is related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| And this is all related to why we would like to have you pass this to actually give them those days back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1418)|
| 0:23:46| Now, granted, we're given seven days, we'll get what we get, and we won't pitch a fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| But at the same sense, we would hope that we would give all of our educators back the days that they had, like they did in the first semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1431)|
| 0:23:59| So we ask you to continue to keep those measures in place, because if we didn't have these measures in place, about the 2,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1439)|
| 0:24:07| could you imagine having to give back those days out of your own general budget, money that you don't have, to the educators?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1447)|
| 0:24:16| And I know it's just a handful of educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| You've talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| So I'm grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| I'm hoping that you will pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| And, again, like I said, we will get what we get, and we won't pitch a fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| Thanks a bunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1471)|
| 0:24:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| You said it was just a handful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| How many does it involve, Mr. Bolton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| I guess I should direct the question to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| Madam Chair, board members, as of right now, we've had about three people that have reached out to us that would benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| I'm sure and certain there are probably others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| We would have to look at it and see to determine the actual number that would be impacted by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| And how much money would we be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| Or are we just taking it out of some federal money that we got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| Now, I may have to defer to Mr. McPherson on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| But capturing that money, capturing the actual dollar amount is going to be difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| I think with regards to actual expenditures, I don't think we're really talking about money going out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| What we're really talking about would be reinstating days that had been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| Am I understanding that right, Scott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| We would be actually giving those days back, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| So it would go back onto accrued leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| The only money we would be talking about is upon retirement if we owed for whatever unused leave at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Well, I'm fine with retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| But are we limiting the number of days that they can, you know, what if they say I only missed seven days but I was 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1562)|
| 0:26:19| We are limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| We followed a lot of precedent that was going on around the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| When the FFCRA emergency days were instituted by the federal government and by legislative action, there were 10 days that were provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1584)|
| 0:26:34| But the quarantine periods and things like that were longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| Now that those days have shrunk, the seven days seems to match the time that they would lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| So they are capped at seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| And to say that, if a person utilized those 10 days last semester, they would not be entitled to the additional seven days this semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1606)|
| 0:26:55| So that way that would be some limitation to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| Would they be entitled to any this semester if they used 10 last semester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| They would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Once you reach 10, that's it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| If they used 10 last semester, it's capped out at seven this semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| Ms. Haywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| So, Mr. Bolton, if I understand correctly, what we are looking at is a difference in providing employees with seven days as proposed here or with 10 days as they were the first semester, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1643)|
| 0:27:39| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| And do you feel like that would be a financial impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| For the district, a financial impact for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| Capturing that number is very difficult because we're talking about accrual days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| So we're talking about days, by and large, that have already been used by the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| And so it would be reinstituting those days back to their leave accrual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| So there would be a value if we're talking about, like, at retirement, when we're talking about that particular $100 or $60 per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1687)|
| 0:28:15| So what we're looking at is a value to the employee but not an impact financially to the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1695)|
| 0:28:25| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| I'm going to defer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Let me ask a different question and let you off the hook on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| Would it be workable for us to pass this as it is now and ask that you find out the financial impact, if any, and bring that to us next month so that we could potentially add three more days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1715)|
| 0:28:50| I think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| I think we could come up with some sort of a model, maybe, that we could calculate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| Obviously, again, we would kind of have to know how many people would take advantage of it so we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| I think that with regards to cash out the door, I want to, again, emphasize that what we're talking about would be those days that if they used, let's say they used three sick leave days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1746)|
| 0:29:18| and then we implemented this and we gave those back, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| So it would depend on 30 years down the road if they retired with three sick leave days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1762)|
| 0:29:31| Then if we still have the $100 notice or $60 notice, depending on when, you're looking at $180 to $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1771)|
| 0:29:42| But it's going to vary between each employee because that employee actually could have used all those days between now and the time of retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1782)|
| 0:29:53| So we could take another look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| We did look at it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| There were just a lot of assumptions we were having to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| So for the sake of time, we kind of backed off because we thought, well, we may not be talking about that many employees as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1801)|
| 0:30:09| And with the financial impact, I don't believe this would be a significant – let me just say it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| I don't see that – if the board passes, I don't see this being a significant financial impact to any budget in any year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1816)|
| 0:30:25| And I want to add to that just because I feel like bringing context into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| The way that we – the plan was written, which allowed for teachers to instruct remotely from home if they were under a quarantine order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1831)|
| 0:30:39| or actually were able to teach but were positive for COVID, cut down on that demand for using a lot of their sick days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1839)|
| 0:30:48| And so having that provision, there were a lot of school districts around the state where that was not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| And so I just wanted to give the context for that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| And thank you, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| Thank you, Madam Chair and board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| I just want to say that, you know, I support the three extra days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| COVID's not any teacher's fault, and they shouldn't be punished for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| I don't know if I can make a motion to add those three days now, but I would like to if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Who seconded that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Ms. Owen seconded that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| So we have a – so we have a substitute motion on the floor to approve 10 days rather than the presented seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1894)|
| 0:31:47| Do we have discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| Item 10C, approve agreement with city of Knoxville for lease of portions of the Christenbury Recreation Center for a period of 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| We have a motion by Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| Was there a second, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| Ms. Owen had a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| And a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| Let the board know that I talked with Melissa Johnson about this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| They have had a wonderful working relationship, and so she's very pleased with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Thank you for that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| Item 10D, discussion and possible action on protocols related to COVID-19 for the 2021-2022 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1962)|
| 0:32:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| We have a motion by Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| We have a second by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| Ms. Satterfield, would you like to speak for a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| I just want, I would like to take a moment, a few moments to acknowledge the comments I made last week as we move into the face mask conversations and all the COVID protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1986)|
| 0:33:15| I recognize that the comments that I said regarding masks and privilege, specifically white privilege, may have offended some and been hurtful to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=1995)|
| 0:33:23| My tolerance threshold had been reached, and those were the words I chose to use to express how I, as a black woman, felt when the number of individuals compared wearing a mask to oppression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2003)|
| 0:33:35| I know my words created a contentious work environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| Colleagues, I ask for your understanding and grace to move beyond what was said and refocus our energy on pressing issues throughout KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2019)|
| 0:33:47| When we get to this moment, I just want to say I fully support Superintendent's face covering recommendations, and I ask that you all do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2027)|
| 0:33:55| We as a board must get back on track and spend our time discussing student achievement and outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| Let's be a reflection of our hard work our teachers and staff are doing every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| These are different mics, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| So I've taken a lot of time to reflect on the meeting from this past week, and especially over this past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2057)|
| 0:34:25| I first have to admit that I am embarrassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| Embarrassed that I didn't stand with my colleague, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Ms. Satterfield, I want to apologize publicly for sitting idly by last week when I was overtly aware of how certain things that were said were likely impacting you and other people of color who were listening in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2071)|
| 0:34:42| I'm even more embarrassed by the fact that I know better, but I did not do better last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| Through many, many years of reflection, studying history and systems, difficult conversations, and black and brown friends being willing to be vulnerable with me when they certainly didn't have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2087)|
| 0:34:58| I've become more and more aware of the privilege that I have as a white male in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| I am at the top of the privilege food chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| This privilege has often afforded me the ability to not hear certain things, to not react, to choose not to enter difficult conversations, to chalk up the pain of another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2106)|
| 0:35:17| to something he or she did instead of the systems that have historically oppressed far too many black and brown people in our country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2117)|
| 0:35:25| and access opportunities that for too many people of color have not had the same level of access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| Don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Every parent who came out and spoke on behalf of their children and others regarding the impact of masks were completely in their right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2133)|
| 0:35:41| And ultimately, we're taking a stand on something that they feel is extremely critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| And for that right, we are all very thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| That being said, when some folks choose to co-opt language such as discrimination and segregation or talk about young people dying as a result of gang and gun violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2149)|
| 0:36:00| or trying to use the legacy of Dr. King to make a case for our very contemporary debate regarding masks in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| is not only not right, but it can also re-traumatize those who have lived under systemic oppression for generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2167)|
| 0:36:14| And I would dare say that most, if not all, of the folks who spoke last week have never lived under systemic oppression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2174)|
| 0:36:22| I say that you or your children are being – to say that you or your children are being discriminated against because they are required to wear a mask is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2182)|
| 0:36:33| Discrimination means you must be intentionally targeted because of something about your person that you did not choose or cannot change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2193)|
| 0:36:41| such as the color of your skin, the place of your birth, a disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| The fact is everyone in KCS has been asked to wear a mask, as demonstrated by the fact we were discussing a policy that indicates as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2205)|
| 0:36:53| It doesn't matter who you are, and no one decided we are going to create this expectation of mask-wearing to target a specific subset of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2213)|
| 0:37:02| It has been simply in response to a global pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| To say that you are being segregated because you are asked to sit in a different part of the AJ building in order to have access to the public meeting because you chose not to wear a mask is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2225)|
| 0:37:16| The fact is, according to current rules at the AJ building, everyone is expected to wear a face covering unless you are able to maintain six feet of physical distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2236)|
| 0:37:26| The fact that folks choosing not to wear a mask were still given access to the building was a grace extended by the KCS administration because they feel, as do I feel, that everyone has the right to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2246)|
| 0:37:39| But that right doesn't mean you get to be in the same area as those who are choosing to follow the current rules in place by masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| What our guests who chose not to wear a mask last week experienced is very similar to being denied access to Weigel's for not wanting to wear shoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2267)|
| 0:37:57| It certainly isn't segregation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| To co-opt the pain of parents and community members who have recently suffered tremendous loss because of the murders of Justin Taylor, Stanley Freeman Jr., Janari Muhammad, Jamari Angelette, and the death of Anthony Thompson Jr. just on Monday, this spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2280)|
| 0:38:15| and to direct this toward Ms. Satterfield directly, who experienced that same sense of loss from some of her classmates being murdered in high school, is completely wrong and uncalled for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2295)|
| 0:38:27| The loss of those students had nothing to do with masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| And instead of systemic oppression leading back to slavery, Jim Crow, redlining, urban removal, the war on drugs, and more that has wreaked havoc on historically black and brown communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2310)|
| 0:38:42| And yes, there were individuals who pulled those triggers, and they should and will be held responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| But the root causes are complex and multigenerational, and I assure you have nothing to do with masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| It is under this narrative that far too many of my black and brown neighbors have raised their families, staying strong, demonstrating tremendous resilience, cultivating beauty and rich traditions, advocating for justice, and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2334)|
| 0:39:09| To co-opt one of our greatest leaders of civil rights, who was ultimately murdered because he believed that no one should be judged by the color of their skin, to make a case for those who choose not to wear a mask during a global pandemic is nothing short of astounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2349)|
| 0:39:24| I never knew Dr. King, but from all that I've read about him, I'm fairly certain that this isn't a fight he would have given much energy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| Not when we continue to see disparity after disparity in this country when comparing our black and brown neighbors with their white counterparts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| One fitting example of a disparity in fact is that since the merger of the city and county schools in 1987, there have been 57 white board members elected and only three of color, with Ms. Satterfield being one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2378)|
| 0:39:53| That is only 5% among almost 25 years of history in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2393)|
| 0:40:01| It is these issues and more that I'm confident Ms. Satterfield, myself, and many others want to continue to dig into when it comes to Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2401)|
| 0:40:09| It is why the Disparities in Education Outcome Steering Committee was formed over five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| It is why that work continues and is being elevated this coming month at our DEO meeting on April 27th at Fulton High School, which I hope everybody here will attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2414)|
| 0:40:23| So let me be the first to say, I'm sorry that last week I misused my white privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| I used it for my own benefit, for my own comfort, when instead I should have leveraged my privilege by standing with my sister, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2429)|
| 0:40:37| I hope to be better in the future. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| Okay. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| And now, Ms. Babb, do we have public forum on this topic before we move to other board members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| Do you have comments regarding the policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| I had a question for Mr. Duport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| Okay. Before we move to public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| Well, I just, I mean, it can wait. I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| Regarding the policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| Okay. We have public forum, so we need to do public forum first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Okay. So if we can hold our questions until after public forum, just hold your questions and I'll, I have a list, so I had people's names already down. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2474)|
| 0:41:24| So after you read the public forum policy, Madam Chair, I mean, Madam Vice Chair, can you come back to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| Yes. I'm going to read, just for the benefit of all that are coming who maybe have spoken in the past or are new to public forum, our policy on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2491)|
| 0:41:39| The Board of Education desires to hear from individuals and or groups on matters important to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| As a normal practice, time is set aside at each board meeting for public forum, during which individuals or groups may request to speak to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2506)|
| 0:41:54| Meetings may occur on occasion when the chair deems it in the best interest of the district to not include public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| A majority vote of members present can overrule the decision of the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| As a rule, public forum at regular session voting board meetings is open to any topic related to education except for personnel matters, which are handled according to board policy B171.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2525)|
| 0:42:17| Public comment at work sessions, called meetings, and other special meetings will be limited to items on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2537)|

| 0:42:55| Speakers may be granted time to speak when their topic of interest is addressed on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| Otherwise, public forum speakers will be recognized as indicated on the meeting agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| The chair may also recognize individuals who have not arranged to speak beforehand if the chair determines that such is in the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2586)|
| 0:43:14| A majority vote of members present can overrule the decision of the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| Recognition of individuals who are not Knox County residents is to be determined by a majority vote of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| Public forum speakers shall address remarks to the entire board and not individual members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| Each person speaking shall state his or her name and county of residence and have up to five minutes to make remarks unless time is extended by a majority vote of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2611)|
| 0:43:41| Members of the board and the director of schools may have the privilege of asking questions of any person who addresses the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2621)|

| 0:43:52| The board asks that speakers show their respect for the board, the staff, and other citizens by speaking in a manner that is civil and courteous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2632)|
| 0:44:00| The chair or vice chair shall have the authority to terminate the remarks of any individual who is disruptive, degrading, or insulting or who does not adhere to public forum rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2640)|

| 0:44:20| Now, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Thank you, Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Just to reiterate, I ask that you invoke your leadership abilities, Madam Chair and Vice Chair, and protect the fellow board members, staff, and community members from verbal assaults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2664)|
| 0:44:34| There were several comments made over the last month that should have never been allowed in a public setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| To the families, teachers, and friends of recent victims who had to hear those words, I apologize to you for even having to endure those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2680)|
| 0:44:48| More importantly, I apologize for allowing those comments to go unchecked by a governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| And we've kind of discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| We've got two topics that I believe a lot of people, they're kind of grouped together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| So we're going to go ahead and have everybody speak now that's kind of signed up on the COVID regulations and face masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| And then we will discuss those two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| So first, Edna Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2716)|
| 0:45:32| If you'll just state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| Edna Gibson, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| I was here last time, but I was pretty frazzled by the crowd and missed a lot of my points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2737)|
| 0:45:47| I also did not thank you, board members, for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| And so I want to make sure to start with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| I really do appreciate all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| I have become intimately familiar with that this week and really, really want to just say thank you to every single person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2756)|
| 0:46:04| Second, I'd like to say I know that there are far more important issues that you need to be working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| And I hate to take up your time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| But until we can ensure that masks are a continued requirement at the beginning of the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2774)|
| 0:46:22| most of those issues are relevant to thousands and thousands of Knox County students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| I just want to touch on a couple of points that were made last week that I didn't bring a pencil in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2788)|
| 0:46:36| So, first of all, there was a recurring theme of masks don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| And I want to reiterate that no masks are not 100 percent effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| They need everybody to wear them to increase their efficacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| So just want to throw that out there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| Somebody said children don't get it or don't spread it as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| I wanted to cite that on the Knox County Health Department's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| They show that over 10,000 children have contracted and tested positive for COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| That's 20 percent of cases being children ages 0 to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| Another point seemed to be super recurring was that children don't die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2835)|
| 0:47:23| And I find that a repulsive standard, frankly, as a mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| I don't base my decisions for what I let my children participate in on whether or not they'll die participating in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2848)|
| 0:47:37| That also leaves out the cost to families when they have to miss work to stay home with those students or for health care costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2857)|
| 0:47:48| The doctor came up and talked about we have treatments for that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| Yet those are accessible to some families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| It's not accessible to a very large portion of our families and especially the communities that tend that statistically contract the virus more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2874)|
| 0:48:06| I was told by another Knox County parent today they did the research and a short term stay for a child at a hospital can cost $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2886)|
| 0:48:18| If you have little to no health care, how do you pay for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| You don't. You just keep your child at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| Another another point that's been made is the vaccine is supposed to be the end game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| It absolutely is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| When we get to herd immunity, I want these masks to go away just like every other parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| But considering that children are 20 percent of the population and children don't have the vaccine yet, we aren't there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2919)|
| 0:48:47| I just need it to last a little bit longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| Also, we keep talking about how we're protecting teachers and children don't get it as bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| So, yes, the vaccine can help protect teachers if they choose to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| If they don't, who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| And again, you you've there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| The vaccine is not 100 percent effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| So now they have the vaccine, but they're in prolonged exposure to 30 to 150 students a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2948)|
| 0:49:19| That efficacy and safety is clearly going to diminish exponentially over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2959)|
| 0:49:28| I had to cross a lot of these off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| I'm just going through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Cases are down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| So now it's time to do away with masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| Masks are why we were able to open schools in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| Masks are why we're able to keep them open without masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| Cases will go up and we will have to close schools, which again impacts, you know, one kid in the classroom gets it and their parent has to stay home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2984)|
| 0:49:52| They've exposed the entire class and all those parents have to stay home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| Best case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| We also take these sort of children already take these sort of precautions with children already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=2998)|
| 0:50:05| We have students with peanut allergies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| We don't ask them to stay home so all of our kids can enjoy a PB&J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| We make these accommodations so that everybody can have a safe and equitable learning environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| I'm just asking for you to consider all the students and make it a safe place for all the students and not just give the oil to the squeaky wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3018)|
| 0:50:31| Thank you again very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| Thank you, Patty King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3035)|
| 0:50:48| And after Patty will be Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| My name is Patty King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| I'm from Knox County and I'd like to be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| So I'm going to step down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| Today I am talking about the mandates again as a music instructor and also as a concerned citizen for these children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| First of all, the contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Do you know how many kids did not catch anything when they were contact tracing, but let me commit other activities outside of school like music lessons, extracurricular sports, outside sports, outside of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3074)|
| 0:51:29| These kids are missing activities for no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| These kids are not carrying this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| And if they are, there's a slim chance of them passing it to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| As it has been said many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| The masks don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| Our own health director, she wears masks all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| These kids are suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| I'm asthmatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| I had to wear the mask to go down there to talk to somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| I am now having problems breathing because of that mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| And I wear a garter, which is supposed to be more breathable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| These kids that have asthma, they have bronchitis, they have all these other illnesses that cause issues with breathing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3124)|
| 0:52:11| They are suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| Also, more people than not, do not wear the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| Now, I go to different stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| There's more people not wearing the mask now because they know they don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Sherry Garrett and then Elizabeth Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| My name is Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| I live in Austin, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| I didn't prepare a statement tonight, but there's quite a few things going on in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| First off, a statement that was made that those who choose not to wear a mask is astounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3164)|
| 0:52:53| There are many, many people who cannot wear a mask for medical reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| I am one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| My mother is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| She has COPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| She will pass out and possibly pass away if she puts a mask on for any length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3182)|
| 0:53:11| As a nurse, I've been a nurse for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| I'm a mom of five boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| I'm a grandmother of 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| I know kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| And I've been a nurse for 30 years, as I've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| I have read each and every study in the past 40 years that showed that masks do not prevent the spread of infection, of a viral infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3204)|
| 0:53:34| The microns on the masks are too big, as the virus is measured in nanometers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3214)|
| 0:53:45| I've read all the studies that have come out in the past year, and these are all opinion-based and supposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| No actual facts, no actual randomized controlled study trials have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| As Dr. Fauci said, they were afraid to do one because they don't want to ask people not to wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3238)|
| 0:54:05| Yet you compare Knox County, for example, in the rate of infection that we've had, to other counties surrounding that have also been masked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3245)|
| 0:54:19| And also those that have not worn masks, that have not passed mask mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| And yet the level that it goes up is around the same, and as it's declining, it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3264)|
| 0:54:31| Masks do not work to prevent the spread of a virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3271)|
| 0:54:39| That's all I have. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| Thank you, Elizabeth Wagner, and then Naomi Elliott after her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3281)|
| 0:54:56| Is Elizabeth Wagner here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| Okay, we will go on to Naomi Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3300)|
| 0:55:07| Is Naomi Elliott here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| Okay, I will skip over and we can come back to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| Steve Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3317)|
| 0:55:43| If you could give your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| My name is Stephen Elliott. I'm from Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3348)|
| 0:55:57| I mean, if you can breathe fine with your mask, you're lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| You know, because a lot of people can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| And these children can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| It's unbelievable to me, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| these kids are going to sit there short of breath and scared to ask the teachers to take a breath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3370)|
| 0:56:19| and not be able to walk out of the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| They got to ask permission to breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| It's unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| I mean, if you've ever been laying in your bed and with your head covered up in your blanket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| and you have these sensations, oh my goodness, you know, it's kind of hard to breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| And you take the blanket away and you take this breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| Well, that's the sensations these children are feeling in their mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| Maybe you don't know this feeling because you breathe just fine in your mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| Well, every other day or every once or twice a week when your 10-year-old child has a headache| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3411)|
| 0:56:59| from not being able to breathe, it's frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| It's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| This is all wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| And these mandates got to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| We can't breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| Abolish the mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| What else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3434)|
| 0:57:22| Yeah, we all know the masks don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| And Dr. Fauci said don't wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| And then everybody's going to bear down on all these big monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| Oh, well, we've got to put the mask on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| Oh, well, we can't end the lockdowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| We've got to have the mask or it looks totally horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| We've got to have the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| We've got to have the lockdowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| You know, when does it end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| It's never going to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| COVID ain't going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| So we're always going to be wearing masks because COVID is not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| It's here to stay, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| You get your vaccine, you can't take your mask off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| You're going to wear your mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| You're going to a restaurant, you're going to eat there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| Everybody's got COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| Everybody's going to spread COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| And to say that kids are not going to die, don't wear this mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| you're not going to die, that's just wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| That's wrong information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| People die from COVID, but you can't just make everybody sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| You can't make everybody sick because somebody's going to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3514)|
| 0:58:43| I don't know what else to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| Thank you for letting me speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| I really have strong opinions, and this is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| It's got to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| We can't bring abolish the mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3535)|

| 0:59:30| If you could please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| Isabella Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| One of my friends wears the same mask every day, and it gets very dirty and dirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| My friend's grandmother tells them not to throw them away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3587)|
| 0:59:55| because it's wasteful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| They just told me two days ago about them wearing a dirty mask to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| I don't know how long they have been wearing the dirty mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| but I know that they said that they wear a dirty mask every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| and that's not healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| Away from school, work, quality time, still the air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3618)|
| 1:00:28| the virus particles are smaller than the holes on a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| Most packages of masks say that masks do not prevent the spread of virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3635)|
| 1:00:45| I really need mask breaks quite often, depending on the type of mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| the material that they are made from, how many layers are sewn in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3650)|
| 1:00:58| the thread count, and how the masks fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| If the thread marks are loose, sometimes I can breathe better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| Some people get bad grades because they need mask breaks and are scared to ask their teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3669)|
| 1:01:17| Away from school, work, quality time, with family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| human beings are not maintaining to wear masks for long periods of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3682)|
| 1:01:33| because it's bad for our health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| Students don't even wash or sanitize their hands often every time that they touch their masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3696)|
| 1:01:49| They are supposed to, at least they sanitize their hands often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| sneezing or gnawing their nose into tissues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| There are some places that respect your health by not forcing you to wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3719)|
| 1:02:08| The school's policy and the policy for many businesses where employees have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3728)|
| 1:02:17| is that people take time away from school, work, quality time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3737)|
| 1:02:24| with family and friends of their obligation or pastime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3744)|
| 1:02:33| to go to the doctor's offices or sick people just to get a note for a medical exemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3753)|
| 1:02:43| so they don't have to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| People have to spend their money to go to the doctor's just to get a piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3765)|
| 1:02:54| They might spend their time and money going to the doctor and not even get a note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3774)|
| 1:03:03| Mask requirements cause harm to children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3783)|
| 1:03:11| Then more harm to children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| Then the virus does contact, taking, tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3795)|
| 1:03:26| Masking also causes more harm to children than the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3806)|
| 1:03:33| Yesterday one of my teachers added an extra desk that is away from everyone to one classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3813)|
| 1:03:45| so we don't have to go to the door outside and stand up when we need a mask break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3825)|
| 1:03:54| The teachers added the desk for mask breaks so we can do our work while being able to breathe freely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3834)|
| 1:04:04| Some classmates need mask breaks too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| Another classmate got to use the desk yesterday when the teacher let us know the desk was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3849)|
| 1:04:23| For mask breaks, many students have been taking mask breaks throughout the year when the teachers aren't looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3863)|
| 1:04:35| Not everyone has a seat where they can hide from the faces to remove the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3875)|
| 1:04:45| Okay, I want to thank you for coming to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| Now, Naomi Elliott, and please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| Naomi Elliott, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| I mean, she's telling you the evidence right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| Are you smarter than a fifth grader?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| Or do you have another agenda that you're trying to fill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| I mean, it's one or the other, or your intentions are for good and you just don't realize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| But there's facts that everyone is submitting that you cannot dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| You've got to trust the science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| The CDC says people who can't breathe should not be wearing masks, but yet the school system doesn't want to follow that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3923)|
| 1:05:29| They still want to force you to wear a mask as long as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| They still won't provide reasonable accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| They just want to exclude you from the free and public education that the public is afforded to according to the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| That's a misappropriation of funding if you're going to discriminate against people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| That's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| You're setting yourself up for liability in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| I told you last week the harm that this is doing to children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| Does my voice count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Do any of our voices count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| Or do I have to have money to pay off our representatives on a state and federal level to get the legislation and regulations how they should be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3957)|
| 1:06:09| We need a more equitable policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| There's too many inequalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| There's too many violations of rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| I spoke with the principal earlier for 30 minutes, and I was speaking double time and still couldn't convey all the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| Yet they're still unwilling to do the reasonable accommodation because a lawyer said so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| His opinion on the law is that we should violate people's rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| The law is the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| It's simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| It's not open to personal private interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| That's why our governor set it up that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| They knew that we had inalienable rights given to us by God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| That's why they secured those rights and protected them with the Supreme Law of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| And then we finally abolished slavery, but yet people were still getting oppressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| And we progressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| We had the Civil Rights Movement, but we still have a long way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4020)|
| 1:07:06| The politicians at the time didn't want to give those concessions to people, but enough people stood up and fought and lost their lives for the cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4026)|
| 1:07:16| And finally, something was accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| But that didn't fix the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| It was a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| There's still oppression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| That's a form of modern-day slavery because you're infringing on people's rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| I mean, you either serve God as your master or you serve men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| It's not God's will to harm people or to have policies that cause harm to people and everyone else that's in their circle of influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4056)|
| 1:07:45| This isn't an issue that just affects the children or the students and administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| This affects their entire families, their friends, caregivers, anyone that they come in contact with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4070)|
| 1:07:57| I told you last week about the amygdala and the stress hormone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| When you're infringing on someone's religious freedoms, you're also infringing on their freedom of speech because to infringe on that freedom of speech is to deny someone the right to express their thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4080)|
| 1:08:13| So they have this belief that helps inform their thoughts to speak freely or to act how they feel is right for them according to their own conscience, not someone else's own conscience, who feels that they should be censored or they should be forced to obey some tyrannical laws just because someone disagrees with them and wants to ignore our rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4093)|
| 1:08:37| That's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| What do you think we should do as kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| We have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| The amygdala that I told you about last week, it's not just responsible for the cortisol and other stress hormones that elicit electromagnetic impulses and cause chemical reactions and physical manifestations such as illness and early death, poor quality of life, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4125)|
| 1:09:07| But it also inhibits the hormones that cause people to be happy and control the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4147)|
| 1:09:14| So how can we be free to have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness if you're hindering our happiness by propagating fear in schools and trying to force people to abide by whatever cult beliefs you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4154)|
| 1:09:28| Or whatever it is that's pushing this, we shouldn't conform to your fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| Yeah, take caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| But we know that these policies are causing harm to children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| That's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| The Director of Children's Hospital even spoke out against that last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| And even the tyrannical Martha Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| But yet you still ignore the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| And that's just enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| We're going to have to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| We're not going to slam our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| You want to deny me my freedom of speech?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| We're going to move on to the next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| I can't breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| You don't want me to drink water either or speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| Kim Sprague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4204)|
| 1:10:16| And if you'll please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| Yeah, my name is Kim Sprague, and I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| I'm a licensed clinical social worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| I also have a PPS credential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| And I have two children in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| But I speak not just for my children, but I've been a mental health therapist with children for over 34 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| I know this is not the only issue impacting children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| But I have been doing this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| And advocating for children and their mental health is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| And I felt, I did feel disrespected that this was brought up and that people were kind of made to think this wasn't important enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4251)|
| 1:10:59| But I will continue to advocate for the mental health of children, and that's what I want to talk to you about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| A couple points, just bullet points really, because we have a limited time and specific to masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4265)|
| 1:11:13| Wearing masks, the negative impact that it has, two key points really, is one that we're creating a hyper-vigilance in these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4273)|
| 1:11:22| A heightened sense of worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| I have seen this in the kids I work with, where they think everyone's going to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| Now, you have to remember, these are the developmental years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| They're not full adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| Their brains aren't taking the information and processing it like ours are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| And so kids often develop irrational fears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| They don't make sense of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| But when you take kids, and this isn't every kid, but when you take kids and have them walking around in fear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4303)|
| 1:11:51| you are increasing their stress hormones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| Cortisol in particular, and there's a lot of research on all the things I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| If anybody wants to see it, I'll email it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| Cortisol in particular actually strengthens your memory of your trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| So these little kids walking around for this past year and hopefully not the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| they're having that fear of people dying really ingrained in them during important years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4330)|
| 1:12:15| I fear, I really do, that the children of today, you can shoot forward in 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| and they will have a higher incidence of anxiety, depression, and suicide, even down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| because we are ingraining that in them now in their foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| So I think it's important to think of that in what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| I'm sure being a school board, you guys are all familiar with ACEs and trauma-informed practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| We know that what we're doing by creating this fear is a secondary trauma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| and this leads to not just emotional health issues but physical health issues down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| So I think our kids have endured enough the past year, and I really want you guys to think about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| and putting the kids through that for another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| Another issue that wearing a mask impacts, and it really hits certain vulnerable populations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4384)|
| 1:13:11| like kids with ADHD, this is all research-based, ADHD, kids with trauma histories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| as well as kids on the autism spectrum disorder continuum, they depend on social cueing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4397)|
| 1:13:26| They depend on being able to recognize other people's facial expressions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| in order to regulate their own emotions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| When I teach, when I work with kids with emotional dysregulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| one of the first things we do is learn how to recognize other people's emotions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| because that's a key part of regulating their emotions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| So you have these kids that are walking around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| you can't really see some of these facial expressions when it's all covered up with a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| Take that to teenage girls, and a common thing I hear with some girls is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| these girls were staring at me and they were, you know, giving me looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| They probably weren't. I know those girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| They were probably anxious or bored or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| But it's even harder with a mask on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| So there's a lot of room for misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| Kids are not getting the social cueing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| And again, for those kids in special populations that I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| it deprives them of developing really critical skills so that they can do their best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4463)|
| 1:14:30| You know, even when I consider what's gone on at Austin East and all that trauma and all that violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| those kids need to see each other's faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| They need that to build that sense of community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| They need to be able to smile at each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| They need to be able to regulate who's looking at them in what way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| and how to read facial expressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| So these are just two points, you guys, but they're really important for children's mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| and there are many more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| So I would hope that you would not have masks next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| Kevin Hill, and after that, Shelly Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| Kevin had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| Kevin had to leave, but he would have not minded if I took his time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| I'm sorry, you're not signed up for public forum, so we have to go to the next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| Shelly Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4520)|
| 1:15:32| Hello, I'm Shelly Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| A friend of mine was actually, she and I were stuck in traffic on 40 trying to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| There was some kind of wreck or something, and her name was already called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| She's here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Can she speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| We'll get to her after I call her name again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| I really didn't prepare anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| I just wanted to say thank you to each of you for listening to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| and especially for the conversation that was had last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| We appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| We appreciate you reading all the, I'm sure, hundreds of e-mails that you've gotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| and so I just wanted to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| I also realize that there are more important topics that we could be talking about tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| and I just want to say my heart goes out to the Austin East community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| and my prayers are with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| and I honestly kind of wish that we could have pushed this meeting out of respect for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| but I do understand things have to get done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| which is why I'm here to advocate for removing the mask mandate for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4591)|
| 1:16:39| I also want to mention that I personally, I can't speak for anyone else up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| but I personally don't agree with some of the things that have been said that were disrespectful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| or calling out in particular names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| I feel like we should be respectful to each other, and that's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| And so I just wanted to remind you that Dr. Childs last week said that this is not necessarily a mask issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4618)|
| 1:17:08| It's a vaccination issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| I mean, he pretty much, I don't have his quotes, but you were all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| He pretty much said that masking is not necessary for next year now that the vaccination is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4634)|
| 1:17:21| and those that want it can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| It is readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| We talked about that last week as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| I think it was you, Ms. Babb, that may have, I'm sorry, I'm not supposed to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| Ms. Babb may have, I think it was her that mentioned that she could get a reservation or an appointment very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4650)|
| 1:17:39| Very readily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| There were plenty of them available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| So the appointments are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| The vaccines are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| If people want them, then it's available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| So I just don't see, in my opinion, and I know several of my friends' opinions, the vaccine is the end game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4668)|
| 1:17:57| And we talked a lot about that last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| We are, I'm feeling like by continuing masks, we're saying there is no end game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4679)|
| 1:18:07| And if that's what we want to continue and want to perpetuate, I personally will be looking into other options for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4687)|
| 1:18:14| It would be a great burden on our family to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| But if you're telling me that there is no end game, then I can't allow my kids to do this for however many more years they have in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4698)|
| 1:18:28| So I believe that this right now, right here, we are at the end game, and this is where it should end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4708)|
| 1:18:35| So, again, I just want to say thank you, and we appreciate you, and I hope that what's best for our children will be done tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4715)|
| 1:18:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Ashley Byrne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4726)|
| 1:18:54| Hi, Ashley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| Let me first start off by saying I have looked at what you guys, what the county decides to pay you, and you are not paid enough to deal with all the nonsense that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4738)|
| 1:19:11| And so I appreciate your time and your commitment, listening to both sides of this argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4751)|
| 1:19:19| I am not here with any passion or emotion for this argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| I'm hoping by the time you got here tonight, your personal decision is made, and nothing that is said tonight is going to sway you based on all the conversation that's had up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4764)|
| 1:19:36| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| Here's what I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| I think both sides of this argument are based out of fear, and it's a personal fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| I think most arguments are based out of fear, whether it's a fear of contracting the virus or spreading the virus to a loved one, or whether it's a fear of your child coming home crying or whatever the case may be from wearing a mask, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4784)|
| 1:19:59| Whether it's the fear of a medical condition that doesn't allow someone to wear a mask, but yet they're being mandated to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4799)|
| 1:20:06| I don't believe any child should deal with fear, to include the shootings that's happened this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4806)|
| 1:20:17| And I think, unfortunately, like I said earlier, you guys aren't paid enough to figure all these issues out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4817)|
| 1:20:25| Unfortunately, some of these issues are on your shoulders, and you have to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4825)|
| 1:20:32| I have my own personal opinion on what that decision should be, but I'm not making the decision you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4832)|
| 1:20:39| And so what I'm going to ask is that no matter what decision it is, we as a community respect that decision, and we respect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4839)|
| 1:20:48| And most importantly, we respect the other side of the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| There's a lot of division in our world, inside and outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| It's too much division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| We can never come together as a community if we just continue to be divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| And I think this is more addressed to the community than it is to the board at this point, because it's just getting to a point where we can't even love our neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4868)|
| 1:21:19| I hear a lot about whether we serve man or we serve God, and at the end of the day, God has commanded all of us to love our neighbor like we love ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4879)|
| 1:21:35| And so I'm here to tell you this, that no matter what decisions you make, it's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4895)|
| 1:21:45| I respect that decision, and I'm asking our community to respect that decision as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| And let's just stop any kind of division that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| That's it. Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| Is it Elizabeth Wagner that has – okay, Elizabeth Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4919)|
| 1:22:09| And if you'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| Sorry. Elizabeth Wagner. I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| Thank you so much for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| I really don't have much to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| I've spoken several times before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| I first want to acknowledge the hurt that has been experienced by the Austin East community and the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| Please know that my thoughts and prayers are with you, and there are much bigger issues than masks going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| But since we are here to discuss this, I felt that I just wanted to take the time to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| Thank you for listening to our stories last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| I'm aware of how difficult your position must be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| I want to thank you for hearing our statements, and I especially want to thank the board members who have reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4971)|
| 1:22:57| and written a letter to myself and to my daughter for speaking last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| Each person's struggles look completely different in this time, but I appreciate you acknowledging hers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| As a seventh-grade little girl, that's super important when people in authority take time out of their busy schedules to acknowledge her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4987)|
| 1:23:16| So I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| I wanted to thank you for allowing equal access to this meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| I really appreciate the links that the Board of Education has gone to to assure that your constituents can all hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5001)|
| 1:23:29| It makes us understand that you hear us and that you care, and I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| I also want you to know that with the same amount of fervor that I've researched for any time that I've spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5014)|
| 1:23:40| I've also been praying for you, for the school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| I believe that change happens when people come together for a common goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| This isn't a me versus you. This is a what's best for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| I will continue to fight for what's best for our children and not just mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| Thank you for allowing us the platform to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| Please give us parents a choice of whether we mask or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| Thank you so much. I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| Thank you. That is all the speakers on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| Okay, thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| Okay, so we have some board members who had their lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| I think Ms. Christie and then Ms. Henderson and Ms. Owen has her light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5057)|
| 1:24:26| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| Yeah, I just had a question for Mr. Duport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| So, and I don't know where the authority to enforce masks or those types of things are granted to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5070)|
| 1:24:44| but I do know that we are currently under a state of emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| in the state of Tennessee that the governor declared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| and I think that expires if he doesn't renew it on the 28th of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| And I'm just curious if that affects what we can and cannot do as a district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5097)|
| 1:25:05| as far as our plan and our protocols and enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| Mr. Duport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| Thank you, Ms. Christie. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| Yes, I mean, that's the short answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| The governor has still declared, and it says it on the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| a limited state of emergency and has extended orders through, as you said, April the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5124)|
| 1:25:32| Don't know, I mean, exactly what he's going to do or what the state's going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| you know, between now and then, but, you know, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| that's what's been done periodically since the pandemic and the emergency was declared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5143)|
| 1:25:49| So there are several agencies that the board has been looking toward for recommendations and guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5149)|
| 1:25:59| and heretofore those agencies have been either the same or similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5159)|
| 1:26:06| But if you have to choose one, the law department's recommendation would be the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| because the state is what actually creates the public school system and the LEAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5172)|
| 1:26:20| And although this board obviously does have local influence as well with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5180)|
| 1:26:28| the state law, the governor, the state board of education, the Tennessee Department of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5188)|
| 1:26:34| are all the best guidance that the board can look to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5194)|
| 1:26:41| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| Kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| So can we enforce the policies, I guess, is kind of what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5210)|
| 1:26:57| I mean, I don't know if that is something that's outlined in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5217)|
| 1:27:06| Like I think giving the health department the authority to, for example, mandate a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5226)|
| 1:27:13| might be written in that state of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| And I'm just wondering if there's anything specifically related to school districts as to what we can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5237)|
| 1:27:26| Or do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| Well, there's a, so the Tennessee Department of Health has a guidance for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5248)|
| 1:27:35| they've got specific guidance for managing and opening schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| So obviously that would be something to look toward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| But I think the real question will be how do you reconcile that if the governor removes the state of emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5265)|
| 1:27:55| or the limited state of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| And obviously, again, I mean, the board needs to look to the state to say, okay, governor, I mean, how do we reconcile this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5277)|
| 1:28:08| But again, I mean, we're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| The governor still has this limited state of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| And these are the, the Tennessee Department of Health has this guidance in place right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| So I guess that's kind of the point I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| This, in part, could be taken out of our hands anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| So, I mean, I'm fine with letting the mask policy sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| I do think we have far more pressing issues right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| And I know all of our teachers haven't had the opportunity to get their second vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| A lot of parents are still waiting for a vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| So I wouldn't necessarily support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| I mean, I think we need to finish out the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| But as far as the, if the proposal is to let it sunset in August, I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5335)|
| 1:29:01| Because I think that there's a high probability we're going to be in a very different place by then anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5341)|
| 1:29:08| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| Ms. Henderson, or Ms. Owen, you had your light on initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| Okay, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| I'll be real fast because, you know, I don't feel the need to talk about masks for five hours again this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| But I just wanted to say in, you know, regards to the plan, I didn't want to just come here and vote no tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| That's why I presented kind of an alternative that I felt was based on local data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5368)|
| 1:29:35| And so that's just where that was coming from that I emailed to the board this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| I believe Ms. Owen was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| I'm going to be a little long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| So if you prefer to go with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| Okay, sure. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| I think I saw Mr. Let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| I wrote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| Then I believe Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| And then Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| Mr. Dupler, just to follow up to Ms. Christie's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| So and I'm going to ask it in an explicit way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| So if the governor should lift his order on the 28th and no order should follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5405)|
| 1:30:12| Do we then lose the ability to enforce any potential mask mandate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5412)|
| 1:30:21| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| Not that I love enforcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| Well, I mean, that's not the point of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| I mean, it's hard to answer a what if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| You know, the governor could give specific guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| I guess what I'm asking, and I think it's where Ms. Christie was going as well, is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| is it that order that gives us the ability to do what we've done so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| And then if that is if the order is what gives us the ability, then my assumption would be if the order no longer exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5445)|
| 1:30:53| then we lose the ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| So I think that's the intent of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| Essentially, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| I mean, I mean, you know, this this pandemic was was declared a state of emergency in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5459)|
| 1:31:05| And, you know, that's what that's what enabled government at each level to do what what it felt like it needed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5465)|
| 1:31:15| The answer is yes to to continue on this path will be problematic for this board if if the state of emergency is lifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5475)|
| 1:31:27| Now, again, what does that exactly look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| We won't know until until it's lifted and we get additional guidance and not to beat a dead horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| But just for the sake of clarity, I'm assuming that means like two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| If just for grins two years ago, we wanted to have a mass policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| We wouldn't have been allowed to do that. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| Yeah. Yes. That's my understanding. I mean, I mean, the reason for all these protocols was due to a pandemic state of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5506)|
| 1:31:54| Thank you. I really appreciate that clarity. And I think given the fact that we don't know what the governor is going to do on the 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| I still think we need to plan locally because I think we owe it to the community and the parents to set a direction that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5520)|
| 1:32:09| the governor can void and make exempt. But I think we still need to set a direction moving forward, regardless of what the governor does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| Although we also understand tonight that it is that emergency him invoking that emergency that gives us that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5537)|
| 1:32:29| OK, thank you, Mr. Watson. Miss Bounds. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| OK, along this same line. So the governor has his order until the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| But I also can you explain a little bit because Knox County is in a little bit different position because we have a health department that regulates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5559)|
| 1:32:52| County versus some of these other counties, as in today, I saw where Sevier County has officially or will officially within the next week eliminate their mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5572)|
| 1:33:04| But they're not. They're in one of those other whatever county, 75, 98, however many there are that operates differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5584)|
| 1:33:14| Well, so can you explain that? Because will we still be under the county health department, even if the governor or does the governor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5594)|
| 1:33:27| Mr. Dupont. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Miss Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| So our office has been consistent in in advising not only this board, but the Knox County Board of Health, that the schools are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5611)|
| 1:33:44| So so you're right, Miss Bounds, in that, you know, the governor has talked about the fact that any counties with their own health department, of which Knox County is one, that that local decisions need to be made within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5624)|
| 1:33:57| But I mean, that's that's talking about the county, the county government and and and the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| But the school system is, I mean, right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| It's I mean, it's it's separate and apart from from the from the rest of the citizens or citizenry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5647)|
| 1:34:13| So, again, I mean, that that brings us back to, you know, what's what's the state doing and what's the state guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5653)|
| 1:34:21| So so so so our recommendation is is that's that's where you look first is the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| Because really and truly, we only have the powers that are given to us by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5667)|
| 1:34:33| The state really controls the schools regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| That's that's that's county. Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| That's essentially correct. I mean, I mean, I mean, you have the power given by the state and then and then and then you are then required to work with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5679)|
| 1:34:47| And but being a local body there, I mean, there are also certain requirements in the in the local charter, the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5687)|
| 1:34:57| But but but the state requirements would trump that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5697)|
| 1:35:03| Thank you, Miss Bounds. OK, Mr. Mellon. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| Not to belabor the point, Mr. Dupre, but to sort of talk just a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5708)|
| 1:35:16| I think they're they're like six counties that have their own health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5716)|
| 1:35:23| I think I've heard that. But if the governor lifts it and doesn't say anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5723)|
| 1:35:35| We could do this board could do whatever we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| Could we not? No matter what the local health department said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5739)|
| 1:35:50| Well, Mr. McMillan, I mean, I mean, I think whatever you want to do is is probably a little bit broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| But I mean, you know, within within what the state has given the power for this board to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5755)|
| 1:36:01| OK, let me let me be a little more specific. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| What everybody wants to know is the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5765)|
| 1:36:11| If the governor lifts, the health department has no means of enforcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5771)|
| 1:36:19| This board making somebody wear a mask, if five members or more of this board say we're not going to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5779)|
| 1:36:30| Or if the superintendent says gives a directive and the board does not challenge, then it would stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5790)|
| 1:36:39| Would it not? Yes, it would stand within the schools. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| OK, I think we're moving now to Ms. Babb and Ms. Babb, are you next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| And then Ms. Henderson, you have your light off. Thank you. OK, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| Yes. I mean, we're talking about the recommendation of the superintendent and we're making that under the guidance that we have right now, which is the Tennessee governor's orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5815)|
| 1:37:04| We do not know any idea what's going to happen, but I do appreciate the guidance of Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| And I do appreciate one of our speakers tonight that spoke about, you know, we have got to come together no matter what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| And I mean, we you know, I know our boards divided. I know our communities divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| But at the end of the day, whatever we decide, we have to get behind it and just move forward because we do have so many more important things to deal with than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5841)|
| 1:37:29| And like but so with that being said, I do feel like Mr. Thomas and his team put a lot of thought into their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5849)|
| 1:37:39| I think there have been some changes taking away from the CDC and actually trying to follow our state Tennessee Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5859)|
| 1:37:46| And with that being said, we I think this this recommendation allows for changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5866)|
| 1:37:53| I think we all hope there are changes. I think we all hope we do not have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| Do mass contact tracing. You know, a lot of things we've had to do this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| But it is April right now and we are trying to give parents some guidance of what we're going to follow in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| And with that being said, I will support the recommendation of the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| Thank you, Miss. Miss. So when Mr. McMillan, do you have your you have your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5894)|
| 1:38:21| OK, Mr. Watson, do you have something quick or I think it's quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| OK, I know. I know. Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5906)|
| 1:38:36| So I appreciate the work that happened and also understand the reason why we're moving toward the Tennessee Department of Guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5916)|
| 1:38:45| Or I guess looking at it singularly instead of some other entities because they might diverge in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5925)|
| 1:38:52| I do have a question about the face covering section of this just because I want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| So I read the Tennessee guidelines related to that and it's quoted directly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| It says young children who cannot tolerate wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| So when I read that, just because of the context in which I live and where I work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| To me, it's like, well, man, kind of all those kids are young. So I don't really know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5952)|
| 1:39:18| And I think especially for it, if this passes our administrators, our teachers, our parents, they need to know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5958)|
| 1:39:27| So I know we're trying to stick with the specific wording of the Tennessee Department of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| But I'd be curious to hear what the administration's thoughts are about what young children means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5973)|
| 1:39:40| And can we make that specific? And then also, if Mr. Dupler has any guidance on that as well, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5980)|
| 1:39:48| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| Thank you, Madam Chair, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| Yes, that's a pretty ambiguous young child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| So especially if you've been around as long as I have, a lot of young children, even in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| But in talking with Mr. Dupler, I think what the interpretation is is preschool and kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6000)|
| 1:40:09| If that's correct, and I'll let Mr. Dupler weigh in, but we'll be glad to make that change to this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6009)|
| 1:40:17| If it needs to be broader, we'll do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| Thank you, Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| So yes, we discussed this, and Mr. Watson, you're right that the Tennessee Department of Health does not define the term young children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6025)|
| 1:40:37| So what I did was I looked at Tennessee case law, primarily a lot of custody types of cases, co-parenting types of cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6037)|
| 1:40:47| and tried to determine what the judges defined as young children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6047)|
| 1:40:55| And there were really two different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| So that's not completely clear, but at least it was by and large narrowed to those two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6057)|
| 1:41:06| The one option was either a preschool-kindergarten type of age child, or another definition was more elementary school type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6066)|
| 1:41:17| I mean, you know, up to age 10, 11, that age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| So predominantly more of the preschool-kindergarten definition, but there were cases that went through elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6081)|
| 1:41:32| So with that, our recommendation would be the board, and Mr. Thomas could choose either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6092)|
| 1:41:40| Mr. Thomas, I think because this is your recommendation, I would like to hear what your recommendation is regarding that word, the specificity around those words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6100)|
| 1:41:51| Preschool and kindergarten, you know, again, if the board, like I said, if they wish to broaden that to include more grades, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6111)|
| 1:41:59| But preschool and kindergarten is, after talking to Mr. Duper, is what I would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| So is it fair to say that tonight that's your official recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| Yes, I'd be glad to change that wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| And again, you know, if board members want to weigh in and make it broader, that's, you know, we'll certainly do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6133)|
| 1:42:20| Thank you. So I also appreciate the line that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| I think this was Ms. Anderson's suggestion about masks are not required when outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| One of the things that, you know, I think we have to admit is always a challenge when you're trying to work with 60,000 students and the number of schools that we have is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6147)|
| 1:42:38| the efficacy of which any of our policies get fully implemented is difficult. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| And so I think the prior policy, the policy that is currently in place definitely addresses these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| But as we have heard in the community, that sometimes they're not completely being honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| And I don't want to make any commentary about why that may or may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| But I think it is important for us to enforce the recommendations and the guidelines as prescribed and be really consistent about that across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6176)|
| 1:43:06| And then one last quick thing. I'm sorry. I thought I was going to be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| And I thought it was under contact tracing under the fourth bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6190)|
| 1:43:15| So I intended to look at this in the Tennessee Department of Health, and I did not get a chance to crosscheck it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6195)|
| 1:43:21| I know the CDC did say recently and I know even locally we changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6201)|
| 1:43:28| That is the contact tracing is at least 10 days from their last contact or the seventh day with a negative test on the sixth day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6208)|
| 1:43:37| So it was specific in that way. So I'm not sure if the Tennessee Department of Health reads that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6217)|
| 1:43:43| But if it does, I think we need to add that language and be clear about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6223)|
| 1:43:51| Yes, sir. I'm certainly fine with researching that a little bit more and making that adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6231)|
| 1:43:58| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| Ms. Owen, are we still coming back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| However you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| Okay. Ms. Bounce. Well, now we have three lights on. I think Ms. Christie may have been first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6246)|
| 1:44:12| Okay. We'll just go in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| So just to be clear, because I got a little confused and thought we were talking about the mask policy since that's what all their speakers just spoke about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6256)|
| 1:44:25| So my comments were more geared toward the proposed changes to the mask policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6265)|
| 1:44:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| And as far as the superintendent's recommendations, I can support these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6273)|
| 1:44:39| I just want people to understand, because we keep saying we have to do this now because people have to make plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6279)|
| 1:44:46| and to be clear that this could all change really quickly and we don't have a lot of control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6286)|
| 1:44:55| The superintendent doesn't have a lot of control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| So, I mean, I think that's really important for people to know that, you know, just because we say this today, it might look completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6299)|
| 1:45:09| And the other thing about, you know, the masks outside and maybe not having consistency enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6309)|
| 1:45:19| one thing that did bother me last week after I went home is I feel like we kind of maybe threw our administrators under the bus a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6319)|
| 1:45:29| Because I think that, I mean, let's face it, they and the people at their schools are the reasons we had had kids in the buildings this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6329)|
| 1:45:40| And maybe we need to be more clear. You know, that might have been the directions we gave them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6340)|
| 1:45:46| Maybe we weren't clear. Maybe some of them thought that that was, you know, in one public forum speaker even spoke to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6346)|
| 1:45:54| my daughter has to choose whether she, you know, plays alone without a mask or plays with her friends with a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6354)|
| 1:46:01| And it could be just the way the policy was written, you know, when social distancing is not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6361)|
| 1:46:08| So I do just want to, you know, express that appreciation for our teachers and our administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6368)|
| 1:46:16| And if there were inconsistencies there, I don't think there were any intentional ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6376)|
| 1:46:22| I think that was just interpretation of the policy and that would, you know, that would be more on us than them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6382)|
| 1:46:30| Thank you, Ms. Christie. Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| In reference to that, Ms. Christie, in my opinion, I think there will be inconsistencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| And I was thinking seriously about supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| But the more I think about it, you know, nobody knows what's going to happen in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6406)|
| 1:46:52| There should be, by that point, there should be ample supply of the vaccine for anybody that wants adult or kids over 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6412)|
| 1:47:08| 12 to 15, anybody over 16, I guess, can get it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6428)|
| 1:47:15| But having said that, one thing we know, when they're outdoors, they don't have to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6435)|
| 1:47:25| So let's look at sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| Everybody enjoys football, high school football, including me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6448)|
| 1:47:35| And everybody will want to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| They have condoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| But that's not the only sport that has come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| Then it's followed by basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| You also have some volleyball, I think, and some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6470)|
| 1:47:58| I've said this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| From a fairness standpoint, I think if you let one do something, they all should be entitled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6480)|
| 1:48:11| I don't care what we're talking about, singing inside, spacing them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| But I don't think they should have to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| And I just pick singing at random.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| And for that reason, I almost bet you that if we pass this, whether it's intentional or unintentional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6506)|
| 1:48:37| maybe not by the administrator personally, but there will be different interpretations by different teachers who are charged with enforcing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6517)|
| 1:48:52| For that reason, I'm not going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| You know, I don't want to spend a lot of time about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6537)|
| 1:49:01| Madam Chair, for our conversation, can you control the crowd with the clapping and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| If we can refrain from clapping so that everyone can hear speakers, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| If you want to vote and make it 8-1, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| And it's not because I'm supporting the people necessarily that have spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6559)|
| 1:49:25| Remember, from a fairness standpoint, kids in school are the most unlikely place that they're going to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6565)|
| 1:49:38| Do you think when they leave school, do you think they go to Walmart or go somewhere to eat or party with their friends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6578)|
| 1:49:46| And, yes, they party with their friends on the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| We can't control that, nor would I want to control it if I had it within my power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6589)|
| 1:49:55| So I think we're just trying to pick things apart and create a situation for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6595)|
| 1:50:07| Now, if you want to send your kid to school and you want them to wear a mask, I think there's nothing wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6607)|
| 1:50:15| Or if you want to send them out on a sports field wearing a mask, that's your decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6615)|
| 1:50:22| But, again, we don't know what fall will bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6622)|
| 1:50:28| But I'm pretty certain, as a matter of fact, I would bet a lot that the TSSAA will not require any masks in their contact sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6628)|
| 1:50:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6644)|
| 1:50:45| Thank you, Mr. Millen. Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| Well, I just first want to say that I appreciate the superintendent listening to the public forum speakers last week and the board in providing this new recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6649)|
| 1:50:59| I would like to see if we're going to define young children, which I don't know that we need to because it actually says masks will not be required for students and staff based on physical distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6659)|
| 1:51:12| But I really do think it should go through fifth grade, given the numbers that we see in the data of the people that contacted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6672)|
| 1:51:22| And I do know that middle and high school were the areas where we had the most contact tracing in cases this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6682)|
| 1:51:30| So I would prefer it at least spell out through fifth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| Secondly, one of the things that has been brought to my attention, I will put under contact tracing, I guess, of the different points or underlining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6695)|
| 1:51:46| And I don't know if this is policy or if it needs to be spelled out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| But it has been a problem in that a lot of schools this year did not get to change classes like they specialize in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6711)|
| 1:51:59| And teachers will do reading and another teacher will do math because of the contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6719)|
| 1:52:05| And then also many of these students have assigned seats in every area so that they can be contact traced, including assigned seating at lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6725)|
| 1:52:17| And for a young child, that's good if you're beside your best friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| But if you're beside someone that's pestering the fool out of you for a whole year, that's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6741)|
| 1:52:28| So I don't know how we're going to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| But I do think it doesn't give children very much of an opportunity to develop friendships when they're assigned seats for an entire year just so that we can contact trace them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6751)|
| 1:52:43| So I don't know how to fix that, but I do think we need to take it into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6763)|
| 1:52:48| Point number three is to what Miss Christie spoke to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| And I had the opportunity to speak to our elementary supervisor and secondary supervisor tonight and ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6772)|
| 1:53:02| They said they both had sent out directives about outside and playground and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6782)|
| 1:53:09| But I do know from listening to people across the county, some schools are doing it, some schools aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6789)|
| 1:53:15| So I had suggested to them maybe a follow up and perhaps at your next principals meeting, you could also address that in person to the principals because I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6795)|
| 1:53:28| And our elementary supervisor had a very good point that some of them may just be depending on their leadership team to talk to them first before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6808)|
| 1:53:38| But I do think that we need to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| And lastly, I'm assuming that the last part, moving schools to red, it's kind of a question and a comment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6821)|
| 1:53:53| So does the red, yellow and green metrics disappear or you just won't be using them to move individual schools to online learning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6833)|
| 1:54:03| Because of what questions I asked this week, I realized that, unfortunately, that the reason we have been on red and yellow for so long is because we have been using metrics that are not strictly COVID related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6843)|
| 1:54:22| And for instance, with the school custodial staff, we've had 40 tests positive all year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6862)|
| 1:54:34| We've had 123 quarantined, but currently there is only one positive case with our custodial staff and many of the custodians, there's only one quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6874)|
| 1:54:47| So we're still on yellow with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| But I feel like we've taken a broader, I didn't really delve into how we figured out those metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6889)|
| 1:54:55| But what I'm saying now is that we've used total absenteeism or lack of having those positions filled to, if I understand correctly, to figure out whether we're going to be on red, yellow and green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6895)|
| 1:55:10| And I feel like that's kind of disingenuous in that, you know, we've had these problems since time began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6910)|
| 1:55:19| And so to include them as part of our metrics for keeping kids masked or, you know, whatever, quarantined, I just feel like the, like the, let me set this other thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6919)|
| 1:55:32| So the fill rate for subs put us on red on March 29th was 62.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| On April 12th, there was 72.2 and we were on yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| And then now we finally reached green on April the 13th was 76.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6943)|
| 1:55:49| But I was working on this problem before I was sworn in and I know you all tried to do everything, even our previous superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6949)|
| 1:55:57| But I don't believe we can keep our system on red and yellow when it's on a problem that's existed forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6957)|
| 1:56:05| So question to whoever, are we going to do these red, yellow and green metrics disappear or does it just apply to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6965)|
| 1:56:15| Yeah, we had no longer had the ability to close a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| So in my mind, there's no need for metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| And the way we came about looking at those metrics was trying to look at what happened in previous years, primarily with flu, when we had student absences and staff absences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6983)|
| 1:56:34| And when did we close? And so we looked at some of those numbers to try to come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| Everyone, if you remember, was talking about metrics. What are your metrics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| We tried to say, hey, we're not just looking at one metric. We're looking at a combination of metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7003)|
| 1:56:49| So in my mind, that goes away unless the governor declares a state of emergency for our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7009)|
| 1:56:55| We don't have the ability to say X school is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7015)|
| 1:57:02| And again, let staff weigh in if somebody missed poking that we have no metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7022)|
| 1:57:07| Well, and I know we were demanding metrics, but I just don't feel like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7027)|
| 1:57:12| I mean, we've been on green for a long time in a lot of areas, except for custodians and substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7032)|
| 1:57:17| And those people are very important to running our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| But it's not indicative of the number of covid cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| And it's not related to covid. It's related to the fact that we can't get subs and custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7045)|
| 1:57:31| But thank you. Thank you, Miss Pounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| OK, Miss Fab. Actually, this this question kind of came up from what she was just speaking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7054)|
| 1:57:41| And I guess I hadn't really thought about it on the red, because even pre covid, we've had days where the schools have had to close because of flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7061)|
| 1:57:49| So is this now saying I don't care whether it's covid or flu or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| In the future, we were not going to be able to go virtual or we're going to have to close the whole system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| How are you kind of interpreting this? Because to me, this isn't even just a covid only issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| We've always had this as a flu issue in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| And I thought hopefully our laptops were going to help this and that maybe we could even do school by school instead of doing this mass, you know, closing of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7085)|
| 1:58:15| Yeah. And let me look. It's OK, Dr. Rasmus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| I know he's had much more communication with the State Board of Education as well as the State Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7099)|
| 1:58:25| So, John, if you don't mind jumping in. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| Thank you, Mr. Thomas. No, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| I think over the course of the last week, that's been a lot of the questions we've had back and forth with the state board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7111)|
| 1:58:38| And they've been they've been great to communicate with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| And so they've been communicating with the governor's office and with the department trying to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7120)|
| 1:58:44| So they feel like there'll be more guidance coming out for us around some of those kinds of things in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7124)|
| 1:58:50| But we did ask specifically to that question in climate weather days, which would be the same as like a flu day that those could be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7130)|
| 1:58:57| And their legal team was on that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| And at this time, they're saying that would not be allowed to to count for a day present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7139)|
| 1:59:05| So we could, in essence, for a flu day or a snow day, you know, close school for that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7145)|
| 1:59:10| But even if we went for a virtual day, that would still count as one of those inclement weather days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| So the one place they did say we may have some latitude in would be around quarantine students that we might be able to count them as like excused absences for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7154)|
| 1:59:23| But, again, they did tell us they think there'll be some more guidance coming out about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| But based on what they're understanding now, that would be that would be where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7167)|
| 1:59:32| OK, thank you. Thank you, Dr. Reiswig. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| Thank you, Madam Chair. First, let me apologize for missing last week's work session and for being unable to answer most of the emails that have come in over the last three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7176)|
| 1:59:45| I did read them all and I'm answering them as as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7185)|
| 1:59:50| Over the last several months, I've watched as our board's focus has seemed to shift from the center of our duties to moving toward politicizing our decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7190)|
| 2:00:01| As nonpartisan representatives, I hope this is concerning for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7201)|
| 2:00:07| When we devolve into discussions that become either or discussions, it should be a red flag that we need to step back and consider whether we are discussing students or politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7207)|
| 2:00:18| With 60,000 students, there are rarely either or decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| When we see only two sides, we need to realize that we are probably looking at a political decision and not a student decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7223)|
| 2:00:31| Student-centered decisions are very rarely presenting themselves with such a clear dichotomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7231)|
| 2:00:38| We are here because we care about our students, our staff, our schools, and our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7238)|
| 2:00:43| and realizing that reasonable people approach issues and solutions from very different places is inherent in our ability to function in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7243)|
| 2:00:52| Also necessary is our ability to reflect and to understand our individual biases, whether they are political, social, or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7252)|
| 2:01:01| how those biases impact our decision-making, and when to step back and recognize that those biases are pulling us away from our vision, our mission, and even our basic duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7261)|
| 2:01:13| Before we can grow lifelong learners, we need to be lifelong learners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7273)|
| 2:01:18| When faced with information that does not match our beliefs, we have to be able to objectively consider the information, even if we don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7278)|
| 2:01:29| We have to be able to sort out which parts are factual, relevant, or appropriate for us to consider in our roles as board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7289)|
| 2:01:38| What we accept as appropriate and relevant information in our personal lives and what we accept as appropriate and relevant information for making decisions for very diverse students may not match,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7298)|
| 2:01:51| and we have to be okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| We took an oath to be okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7314)|
| 2:01:57| While many of us have expert knowledge in certain specialties, we certainly don't all have the same knowledge, and we shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7317)|
| 2:02:05| It would not be appropriate for us to make decisions as if we were experts in all areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7325)|
| 2:02:11| We have worked to hire and retain the very best staff who are experts in their individual specialties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7331)|
| 2:02:17| and our administrative staff has worked to ensure we have the necessary expertise available either directly or as consultants to our staff to be able to weigh all the possible options for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7337)|
| 2:02:30| Their expertise is used every single day, and we have worked very diligently to ensure we have policies in place to allow our students to make necessary decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7350)|
| 2:02:39| I'm sorry, to allow our staff to make necessary decisions when our students need those decisions to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7359)|
| 2:02:46| I found a great program while I was stuck at home for the past three weeks, and it followed two archaeologists and a historian as they learned to farm for an entire year using only Victorian knowledge and practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7366)|
| 2:02:58| and then a year using only Edwardian knowledge and practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7378)|
| 2:03:02| As they planted and grew their fields toward harvest time, they called in experts to help them learn everything, all the way down to how to best separate the grain from the chaff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7382)|

| 2:03:26| Knowing how to capture the most important bits and allowing experts and continually evolving science to guide them was critical to our ancestors' ability to stay alive, and that has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7406)|

| 2:03:46| Today, we have a lot of chaff being thrown at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| We have entire online networks that are solely devoted to creating and distributing information to discredit and disparage experts in a wide variety of fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7429)|
| 2:04:00| Unfortunately, information from those very purposeful campaigns has been repeatedly presented to this board as if it is real and reliable information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7440)|
| 2:04:09| We cannot use that kind of chaff to make health decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| The U.S. has a Center for Disease Control, and controlling disease is their one job, yet it has been suggested that we just ignore that entity entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7454)|
| 2:04:24| Regardless of our individual politics, that should not make sense to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7464)|
| 2:04:30| We happen to live in such a large county that we are one of the few to have our own health department with medical and data specialists capable of narrowing recommendations to those that are specifically appropriate to our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7470)|
| 2:04:42| yet it has been suggested that we just ignore that Knox County-specific, expertly dissected data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7482)|
| 2:04:49| Regardless of our individual political leaning, that should make no sense to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7489)|
| 2:04:54| These decisions that we are being asked to make are not political decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| These are medical, health, and life and death decisions that will literally impact our community for generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7499)|

| 2:05:17| Health and welfare decisions should not be made via social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| They certainly shouldn't be made by people who do not have expert researchers and expert health professionals at all levels guiding those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7521)|
| 2:05:30| COVID-19 did not present itself to the world with a sundown date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7530)|

| 2:05:46| Wanting it to be over doesn't send it packing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| Throwing out everything we know to be working so that we can ignore the reality of the constant sickness and death around us doesn't end the sickness and death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7549)|
| 2:05:58| When I see people who refuse to follow the basic health guidelines, I have a lot of unanswered questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7558)|
| 2:06:06| And whether to discuss those questions or not, I went back and forth, but based on some of the really horrible emails we have gotten over the past several weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7566)|
| 2:06:15| including attempts to either bully or scare us into submitting to pressure, I think it's important that you hear some of the questions that have been in my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7575)|
| 2:06:24| especially if these are questions you haven't considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7584)|
| 2:06:29| When I come to meetings and see people refusing to follow our own Knox County Schools health and safety policies, I wonder what could drive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7589)|
| 2:06:37| When I see people being encouraged to enter and allowed to remain in the AJ building while refusing to follow the health and safety policies we have put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7597)|
| 2:06:46| I wonder how that could be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7606)|
| 2:06:49| Knowing that we have a duty to communicate the needs of our schools to the public, I am very confused by the nonverbal communication that we share with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7609)|
| 2:07:01| Most distressing to me is that I can't help but wonder why my life is not worth protecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7621)|
| 2:07:08| I don't need a kidney and I'm not asking for a liver. I just need people to contain their own spittle and sputum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7628)|
| 2:07:16| I need the moist droplets that we can clearly see when we breathe on a glass to be contained as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7636)|
| 2:07:25| I need the people around me to help contain any viral particles they may be carrying and to keep them out of the air that I have to breathe as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7645)|
| 2:07:37| When we talk about requiring safe footwear, there's no huge debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| We all know sandals aren't safe in PE class. We all know we have to wear shoes when we go into businesses to avoid spreading disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7662)|
| 2:07:50| But this little piece of cloth that has been proven again and again to be the main thing that is working seems to be too much to require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7670)|
| 2:08:01| And when I look at my life next to a strip of cloth and I'm told that using this is too much of a hardship for people to bear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7681)|
| 2:08:11| to save people from a horrific virus, that's something I can't wrap my mind around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7691)|
| 2:08:17| Our country has allowed the health and safety of our people to be led by politics rather than experts in science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7697)|
| 2:08:24| And had we made decisions to fully follow our health experts this time last year, maybe this pandemic would have ended long ago and we wouldn't be having any of these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7704)|
| 2:08:37| If we as a body choose to bend to social pressure rather than medical and health expertise, we could be stuck here for a very, very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7717)|
| 2:08:49| Regardless of the time this pandemic actually ends, we all know that it will not conform to any political end date we try to impose on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7729)|
| 2:08:58| Doing our jobs involves helping the community to understand the reality of our situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7738)|
| 2:09:04| And helping the community to do the opposite, which would be to ignore the reality of our situation, cannot help us out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7744)|
| 2:09:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7759)|
| 2:09:20| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7760)|
| 2:09:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| We had to sit here and be lectured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| I think I am entitled to make a comment since I probably feel like she was talking on a couple points to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7766)|
| 2:09:39| Number one, if you're talking about me not wearing a face mask, Ms. Owen, I wore one in the building until I got in here and in my seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7779)|
| 2:09:50| Number two, I've had both my shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| I had the second one the day after Valentine's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7793)|
| 2:09:58| So if they work, they should have gone into effect long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7798)|
| 2:10:07| And you said something about political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| You brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7810)|
| 2:10:12| I hadn't even thought about it until you brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| But if you want to talk about being political, I guess the way you look at it, it could be considered that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7815)|
| 2:10:28| Not by me, but I don't have any faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7828)|
| 2:10:37| to think about the long term ramifications of what is happening because of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7837)|
| 2:10:44| And when when is when do we need to return to normal as a lot of the school districts around us are doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7844)|
| 2:10:52| And and I think they've probably wrestled with these decisions just like we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7852)|
| 2:10:57| And they're making decisions based on more than one component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7857)|
| 2:11:01| And that's what I hope that we will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| So I'm I'm when I hear from health care professionals and teachers, I've heard from a lot of teachers this week, more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7863)|
| 2:11:12| I've just I think the teachers have kind of held their tongue as long as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| I've heard from a lot more this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| I've heard I heard from an ELL teacher who said, can you imagine you can't imagine how difficult it is to try to teach a child a different language when you have a mask on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7878)|
| 2:11:30| So, first of all, it's hard to begin with, like they have some of the hardest jobs in our entire system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7890)|
| 2:11:37| And then you put a mask on everybody. So we're asking a lot of these teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7897)|
| 2:11:43| I heard from other teachers who are very concerned about the academic impact that this the negative impacts that this will have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7903)|
| 2:11:52| because the kids can't see their mouth moving with phonics and all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7912)|
| 2:11:57| And I'm not a teacher, so I have to just take the expert's word for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| But that makes sense to me, you know, that that would be important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7921)|
| 2:12:05| So I think we have to look at a lot of the developmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7925)|
| 2:12:11| I the ACEs comment that was made earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7931)|
| 2:12:15| I thought about that a lot last week as I listened to parents speak that we we want to minimize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7935)|
| 2:12:20| I mean, you talk about ACEs and I feel like we're this whole thing and not it's nobody's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| It's just it's probably going to be a result of this in some form or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| And it's it's not anybody's fault. It is what it is. But I think we have to be honest about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| So so my concern with, you know, making decisions right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7956)|
| 2:12:43| And it's difficult because everybody wants to know. Parents have me to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7963)|
| 2:12:48| I would hope that it would be obvious to everybody that by the time we get to fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7968)|
| 2:12:55| that we are in a position that that parents don't need to be fearful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7975)|
| 2:13:01| I was very comforted by Dr. Childs giving us his professional opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| He's one of the premier experts in the in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7985)|
| 2:13:09| And I thought it was very comforting to hear that him say the vaccine is the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7989)|
| 2:13:15| that we have a vaccine. All of the adults will have the opportunity to have that vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=7995)|
| 2:13:20| They have it now. And that coupled with the fact that only, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8000)|
| 2:13:26| 0.17 percent of people in Knox County currently have COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8006)|
| 2:13:33| There's there are there are obviously studies that will say whatever you want them, whatever your opinion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8013)|
| 2:13:40| I'm sure you can find a study that says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| I saw some this week that talked about that. The issue of the asymptomatic asymptomatic spread,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8022)|
| 2:13:50| even if you've had COVID and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8030)|
| 2:13:54| There are about 10 studies that show that with 70 to 90 percent efficacy, that the it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8034)|
| 2:14:04| It's not transmitted after you have have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8044)|
| 2:14:09| The vaccine. And so those were there's several different agencies listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8049)|
| 2:14:15| One of them was was appeared in The Lancet on March 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8055)|
| 2:14:19| And I know that's a very well respected medical journal that was regarding health care workers in Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8059)|
| 2:14:27| That actually was one of the lower ones. That was a 75 percent reduction in asymptomatic spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8067)|
| 2:14:33| So there there are there are studies that support, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8073)|
| 2:14:40| the fact that a lot of people have the view that we are nearing the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8080)|
| 2:14:44| Yes, there's still COVID. But I guess my question is, do we really think that we're ever going to get rid of COVID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8084)|
| 2:14:50| I mean, it's probably we may. I hope we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8090)|
| 2:14:53| But I think it's entirely possible that it could be a virus that sticks around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8093)|
| 2:14:58| So we are we have very, very low levels right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| I honestly kind of thought we might see a spike in our schools after spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8102)|
| 2:15:07| But but, you know, it stayed low. So you look at the comparisons in the states that do not have a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8107)|
| 2:15:17| And the trend is the same. You know, the trend is the same as far as if you had a mask mandate or you didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8117)|
| 2:15:25| So so anyway, I'm not sure that that that would have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8125)|
| 2:15:31| I think the virus I think that kind of says the virus has to run its course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| So so. I am in favor of Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8135)|
| 2:15:42| Henderson's proposal that we sunset the policy for face masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8142)|
| 2:15:48| If some something happens and we have a surge in during the school year with the superintendent can certainly address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8148)|
| 2:15:55| But I think that we have enough evidence right now that says that we're moving in the direction that that will not be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8155)|
| 2:16:03| And that will be helpful for parents who are making a decision about next school year to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8163)|
| 2:16:10| I'm not comfortable, frankly, right now at this point, agreeing to the physical distancing piece of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8170)|
| 2:16:16| I don't know if that's something we can wait on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8176)|
| 2:16:20| If if I had my opinion, I mean, my opinion would be that we deal with the face coverings policy and that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8180)|
| 2:16:31| Perhaps put this document on hold for a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8191)|
| 2:16:37| So I would like to hear other people's opinions on that. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| Thank you, Madam Chair. These mics work as good as they put some money in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8202)|
| 2:16:49| I think we already did, though. So I appreciate your comments related to teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8209)|
| 2:16:55| I got the same email from the teacher. I think we I think they sent it to all of us or maybe sent it through you or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8215)|
| 2:17:02| And I've got friends who are teachers. And I think I made this point last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8222)|
| 2:17:10| It's been very clear to me and I made this comment last week that are our teachers, our community, our constituents, our local doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8230)|
| 2:17:20| All of them are very split. I mean, it's I can I can name teachers that are that say we need to keep this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8240)|
| 2:17:27| It's working. And obviously there are teachers that don't. And so to Miss Owens point of none of us being experts in this field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8247)|
| 2:17:35| I think we as a school system have to identify for the public who is it that we're going to look to for continuing guidance on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8255)|
| 2:17:43| And it needs to be consistent because we can't change who we're looking to all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8263)|
| 2:17:50| I think for us just to make a decision about the mask policy and not do something with the recommendations from the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8270)|
| 2:18:01| Is a little short sighted in the sense of the whole mask policy was birthed out of recommendations from the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8281)|
| 2:18:08| I don't know how in the world we can make a decision related to a singular policy that was connected to a reopening plan unless we're going to address how we're going to shift that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8288)|
| 2:18:18| And to me, again, I think the part that we need to be really clear about and I think there's an attempt to do that in these recommendations is to say as a school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8298)|
| 2:18:28| This is who we're looking to for guidance and then everything else can fall out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8308)|
| 2:18:32| But if we consistently change our mind on who we're going to look to for guidance and who we're going to tell the public we're going to look to for guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8312)|
| 2:18:39| I don't know how you continue to move forward and not have this debate every month. I just don't know how you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8319)|
| 2:18:45| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Watson. Miss Pounds. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8325)|
| 2:18:53| I'm OK with what you suggested and looking at the mask mandate and sunsetting that policy and addressing this Henderson's into the air policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8333)|
| 2:19:03| Given what was stated at the very beginning of the meeting with Governor Lee and his April 28 deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8343)|
| 2:19:14| If you held off on the superintendent's recommendation, it would put it after that date and at the main meeting and we might have further information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8354)|
| 2:19:26| I kind of agree with you on this physical distancing. It still bothers me that kids are that far apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8366)|
| 2:19:34| So they're in the assigned seats and they're not being able to ability group or to group according to subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8374)|
| 2:19:42| And then what really bothers me the most is bullet point number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8382)|
| 2:19:48| And that is the self quarantining for 10 days based on contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8388)|
| 2:19:56| I just can't tell you how many kids have missed so much school this year based on the fact that they've been quarantined three and four times and never got COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8396)|
| 2:20:07| I mean, we've seen that over and over. And when you've got I remember the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8407)|
| 2:20:11| Now, I think at one time it was twenty five thousand quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8411)|
| 2:20:16| And what was it like? I don't know. Two thousand five thousand that actually had had COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8416)|
| 2:20:21| So I just that really bothers me. I think our our job is to educate kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8421)|
| 2:20:27| And I just don't think as has been done in the past that the quarantining works based on contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8427)|
| 2:20:37| So there may have to be some form of contact tracing, but it needs to be a lot better than what we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8437)|
| 2:20:45| So that's just my thoughts on that. The contact tracing, as it's been done in the past, really concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8445)|
| 2:20:52| And again, the assigned seats and being able to do groupings also bothers me with three and six foot space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8452)|
| 2:21:04| Thank you, Miss Bounds. Miss Henderson. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| I just wanted to say that I agree with Miss Horne's recommendations and I think it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8469)|
| 2:21:15| I think it deals with our local community and what's happening here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8475)|
| 2:21:20| And I also appreciate Dr. Childs last week, because he is a doctor at Children's Hospital that has still dealt with children in our community with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8480)|
| 2:21:28| And I thought what he had to say was very hopeful. And I had a follow up conversation with him the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8488)|
| 2:21:34| And I was very comforted by what he said. And I think that we need to listen to the experts in our community like Dr. Childs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8494)|
| 2:21:41| Thank you, Miss Henderson. I'm not sure whose flight was first. Miss Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8501)|
| 2:21:47| I would just like to ask that when we look at these issues, that we do them in the order that we approved in the agenda changes at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8507)|
| 2:21:57| And that we look at the superintendent's recommendations first and then move to the mask policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8517)|
| 2:22:03| Yes, that's the plan. Thank you. Miss Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| And I really would just like us now I would like to come back, but I would like us to take a vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8526)|
| 2:22:12| I mean, I think we've kind of talked it to death. I mean, unless there's just really something that somebody else has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8532)|
| 2:22:20| You know, I think I don't know where we all stand, but I think it's kind of at the point that we do just need to go ahead and take a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8540)|
| 2:22:28| And I don't know if I need to make a motion to take a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8548)|
| 2:22:36| So we had we had a motion for discussion and possible action by Miss Christie and Miss Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8556)|
| 2:22:43| So if if someone wants to make a motion, we can entertain that. Mr. McMillan is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8563)|
| 2:22:49| So we may want to he'll be right back. I mean, we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8569)|
| 2:23:00| Since we do not have a motion on the floor, I recommend that we take a five minute recess and come back at 736.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8580)|
| 2:23:06| Thank you. There was an error on public forum and we want to say we're sorry, but we have one more speaker on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8586)|
| 2:23:18| And we're going to give him five minutes because there was just a mistake that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8598)|
| 2:23:23| So if Ethan Lindsay will come up and say your name and county of residence and you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8603)|
| 2:23:31| Hi, thank you. I'm Ethan Lindsay, Knox County, and I go to the Ellen and STEM Academy over that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8611)|
| 2:23:39| I wanted to start off just by thanking everyone here and everyone who has been here through this pandemic and everything that everyone's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8619)|
| 2:23:48| I specifically want to thank our local health professionals and everything that they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8628)|
| 2:23:53| I know there's obviously been disagreement on what everyone believes, but no matter what they've been fighting on the front lines and they've put their lives down really to help us get through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8633)|
| 2:24:04| whether it be in a hospital or giving public advice on what we need to do as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8644)|
| 2:24:12| Yeah, I think that we really we need to follow the science and we need to see what the science says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8652)|
| 2:24:17| We need to follow our local health officials because they are able to give us the information that we need for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8657)|
| 2:24:23| We don't have comprehensive things. The government's not capable of doing something, everything for just one Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8663)|
| 2:24:32| So I think we need to focus on what our local officials says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8672)|
| 2:24:36| As I said, on a personal note, I lost my great grandma to COVID-19 in December of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8676)|
| 2:24:46| And yeah, she had a lot of pre-existing conditions, but COVID-19 was the final straw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8686)|
| 2:24:52| And she, along with five hundred and sixty thousand other people were have been killed by this disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8692)|
| 2:25:00| And when you think about it, we have four hundred and seventy thousand people who live here right in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8700)|
| 2:25:06| And just to imagine that that amount of people could all be gone, plus those in the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8706)|
| 2:25:13| It's insurmountable. COVID is not over yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8713)|
| 2:25:18| And while we have about 20 to 30 percent of the population vaccinated, and that's great right now, right before the school year ends is not the time to stop following guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8718)|
| 2:25:29| I know nobody likes masks. Trust me, I go to LNN and it is all stairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8729)|
| 2:25:34| So I am running up every day and trying to catch my breath at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8734)|
| 2:25:39| But and I have plenty of conditions. I am the student with Asperger's who has trouble reading facial expressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8739)|
| 2:25:46| And I have ADD and trouble breathing. And I know that it is a lot for other students to take in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8746)|
| 2:25:53| But I don't mind taking a minute to catch my breath if it means that I don't have to see someone else lose their life to this disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8753)|
| 2:26:02| And I've seen what younger kids are facing. I volunteered through this pandemic, through the Knox County school system to teach elementary students at that level to teach them STEM concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8762)|
| 2:26:13| And I've seen what the teachers are facing. And I sympathize with all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8773)|
| 2:26:18| And I know it's been said for so long, but we need to stick with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8778)|
| 2:26:23| We don't want to drop our defenses just to be taken out at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| And it's our responsibility to protect each other. And not doing that is a real abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8788)|
| 2:26:34| I don't know what August looks like. I don't think anyone in this room is able to see what August looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8794)|
| 2:26:40| But until then, I think that it's important that we follow the guidelines that we wear our masks and that we social distance and get a vaccine whenever possible until we are able to see what August looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8800)|
| 2:26:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| Thank you very much. Appreciate you speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8814)|
| 2:26:58| The end of all our speakers on this topic on this topic. Okay, thank you so much, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8818)|
| 2:27:03| Thank you, Madam Chair. I promise this is my last comment on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8823)|
| 2:27:08| So in part, Dr. Childs and Dr. Buchanan were both here last week because I asked Superintendent to bring them up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8828)|
| 2:27:16| And the reason I asked for that is because I knew they varied in their opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| And it's interesting to me that tonight, some who really value Dr. Child's opinion, which I did as well, are now using him as like the stake in the ground to say let's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8841)|
| 2:27:34| The reason I asked for both of them to be here, and I've said this point many times, is you will find people who are very skilled in their different disciplines who will land very differently in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8854)|
| 2:27:47| And again, I want to reemphasize, we have to tell the public who we're going to say that we're going to listen to related to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8867)|
| 2:27:56| And if we want to put Dr. Child's name in these guidelines or recommendations, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8876)|
| 2:28:02| And I'll stick with it. But again, for the public, we have to let the public know who we're going to look to for guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8882)|
| 2:28:11| And it cannot be somebody different every week, whoever gets to come and speak and who we feel good about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8891)|
| 2:28:18| We have to I think we have to do better by the public than that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8898)|
| 2:28:22| Thank you, Mr. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8902)|
| 2:28:28| Miss Babb, I make a motion to take this to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8908)|
| 2:28:34| The recommendation of the superintendent in the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8914)|
| 2:28:40| Hey, Miss Babb made a motion. There's a second by Miss Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8920)|
| 2:28:45| We had several recommended changes. I want to know what's included in your motion and what we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8925)|
| 2:28:51| OK, I've seen your motion. Let me make sure that I've got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8931)|
| 2:28:54| But my understanding of them is in under face coverings, we are qualifying young children to be pre-K and kindergarten students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8934)|
| 2:29:08| Were there any other. There was one more that I made related to contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8948)|
| 2:29:13| I think if we're going to use the Tennessee Department of Health, if their guidance matches the CDC related to on the seventh day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8953)|
| 2:29:24| So it would say 10 days from their last contact or seventh day with a negative test on the sixth day, if that matches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8964)|
| 2:29:31| Could we have Mr. Myers coming up? I mean, I felt like I was seeing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8971)|
| 2:29:36| He's right there nodding when we were talking about this. Can you clarify some of that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8976)|
| 2:29:42| And maybe you're the right person. You seem to have been. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8982)|
| 2:29:45| And if we're on that topic, I think one other question I would have is we have here six feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8985)|
| 2:29:51| If we're going by the Tennessee Department of Health, are they going by the three feet or are they still at six feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8991)|
| 2:29:57| Because there's the CDC has said three. We're still at six. I don't know where the Tennessee Department of Health is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=8997)|
| 2:30:03| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'll address the first question on the accuracy of the quarantine rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9003)|
| 2:30:10| Essentially, it would be the test could be on the sixth or seventh day and they return on the eighth day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9010)|
| 2:30:17| That would be the that would be the exact language on on that day range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9017)|
| 2:30:23| And let's see, your next question was about the social distancing. Can I just one clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9023)|
| 2:30:27| So without the test, it's 10 days with a test on the sixth or seventh day. You can return on the eighth day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9027)|
| 2:30:33| Exactly. Yes, ma'am. OK, so we want to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9033)|
| 2:30:37| And then the next question was on the social distancing. So the social distancing recommendations do mirror one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9037)|
| 2:30:44| So it's three feet for elementary school students. I think that the point of concern, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9044)|
| 2:30:49| from members of the board I've spoken to is how it relates to contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9049)|
| 2:30:53| The contact tracing recommendations also mirror one another and contact for the contact tracing component, a close contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9053)|
| 2:31:01| The measure is still six feet. So while the guidelines are saying that elementary school students can can use three feet for social distancing in the classroom setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9061)|
| 2:31:10| it does not change the criteria to be considered a close contact in any of the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9070)|
| 2:31:16| OK, I gotcha. That makes sense. Thank you for those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9076)|
| 2:31:20| So my vote is on the OK, so under face coverings, young children is clarified as pre-K and kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9080)|
| 2:31:26| And then they'll use the language that Mr. Myers clarified on contact tracing that testing you can get out of quarantine after six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9086)|
| 2:31:39| After testing on the sixth or seventh day, testing negative, you can get out on the eighth without testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9099)|
| 2:31:44| You get out on the 10th. That's correct. OK. OK. That is the motion I'm making for us to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9104)|
| 2:31:51| OK. And you're OK with that. OK. Any other comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9111)|
| 2:32:02| And we'll do a roll call vote. So, Ms. Coatney, if you want to start with District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9122)|
| 2:32:08| Ms. Satterfield? Yes. Ms. Owen? Yes. Mr. Watson? Yes. Ms. Babb? Yes. Ms. Henderson? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9128)|
| 2:32:19| Ms. Bounds? No. Mr. McMillan? No. Ms. Christie? Yes. Ms. Horne? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9139)|
| 2:32:26| OK, so it's five yes votes and four no votes. So this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9146)|
| 2:32:38| And now we will move, actually, unfortunately, the way our policies are listed, we have said we're moving them as they are, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9158)|
| 2:32:48| We have the student activities listed first and then we have face coverings listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9168)|
| 2:32:53| So is that correct, Ms. Coatney? That's the way we said we were going to move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9173)|
| 2:32:58| So that means that we have to now go to student activities and then back to face coverings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9178)|
| 2:33:04| Isn't that nice? So. Not well thought out. Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9184)|
| 2:33:10| We have one speaker on the activities and it is Tana Nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9190)|
| 2:33:25| And I will go ahead and say I know Ms. Nicely does not live in Knox County, so we might need to put it to a vote that we're allowing her to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9205)|
| 2:33:32| She is a principal at one of our schools. OK, so are you making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9212)|
| 2:33:38| I'm making a motion to let Ms. Nicely speak. And Ms. Christie seconds. Do we have any discussion? All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9218)|
| 2:33:46| Any opposed? Motion carries. Thank you, Ms. Nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9226)|
| 2:33:49| Now if you could just give your name and county address. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9229)|
| 2:33:53| Superintendent Thomas, Board Chair Horne and all these wonderful people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9233)|
| 2:33:58| I just want to say thank you for everything you're doing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9238)|
| 2:34:02| I'm a principal in Knox County School, a very proud principal who has lived this Knox County School plan and the district plan for this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9242)|
| 2:34:12| So thank you for everything you are doing and you're doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9252)|
| 2:34:15| And I'm so sorry for some of the ugly comments and emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| But just know administrators in this district really honor you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9259)|
| 2:34:23| So I'm also here tonight, though, besides being an administrator with the Knox County School System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9263)|
| 2:34:28| I'm also president of the Knox County Education for Elementary Principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9268)|
| 2:34:33| So that's a KCEPA. So I'm here representing the Knox County Elementary Principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9273)|
| 2:34:39| And so as their representative, as you consider policy J462 and any other amendments to our Knox County plan during this challenging time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9279)|
| 2:34:51| as an acting principal that's lived this plan and as a representative of all the outstanding KCS elementary administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9291)|
| 2:34:59| I ask for you to carefully consider the ramifications of such changes at this time of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9299)|
| 2:35:07| In reference to the proposed J462, we are already working toward making things as normal as possible for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9307)|
| 2:35:17| If you are in a school right now or hear of a principal, we are trying to come up with end of the school activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9317)|
| 2:35:24| looking at a way to make field day work, thinking of fifth grade graduation, pre-K graduation, kindergarten graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9324)|
| 2:35:33| I'm having a book fair at my school as we speak this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9333)|
| 2:35:38| Lots of things, Dr. Seuss Day, you know, all those things to try to make it as normal as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9338)|
| 2:35:45| And it's been a challenge this year, but we're trying to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9345)|
| 2:35:49| So I feel like that, and the principals feel like that J462 may be a little bit redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9349)|
| 2:35:57| Our plans have worked because of the dedication to wearing the face coverings, limiting visitors, and maintaining social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9357)|
| 2:36:04| We have 28 days of school. A child came up to me today and said, if a countdown is on, Dr. Nicely, 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9364)|
| 2:36:12| We are also getting ready to go into standardized testing, so we are really finishing like a, I love football too, Mr. McMillan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9372)|
| 2:36:21| and so we're on, you know, we're in fourth and goal and we're getting ready to go for the touchdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9381)|
| 2:36:27| So we only ask that we finish the school year with our school plans in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9387)|
| 2:36:33| We would welcome being part of the conversation moving forward this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9393)|
| 2:36:38| so we can have our kids and our families back in our schools in fall of 2021. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9398)|
| 2:36:45| Thank you. Okay, Ms. Bounds, did you have a comment or we want to let Ms. Henderson speak first since it's her proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9405)|
| 2:36:55| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9415)|
| 2:36:56| Thank you, Madam Chair and Board. I want to thank you for your words. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9416)|
| 2:37:00| Sorry, hold on one second. Can we have Ms. Coatney read the item first and then we'll come back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| Yes, I apologize. Approve first reading of new proposed Knox County Board of Education Policy J462 student activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9425)|
| 2:37:14| We have a motion. Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9434)|
| 2:37:17| Yes, there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| And is there a second? Okay, we have a motion by Ms. Owen, a second by Ms. Bounds. Okay, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9439)|
| 2:37:27| Yeah, so I make a motion to suspend Board Policy B200 policy development adoption and the requirement for two readings on this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9447)|
| 2:37:36| and to approve new Board Policy J462 student activities on one reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9456)|
| 2:37:43| Okay. So this motion, that motion, so we have a motion regarding the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9463)|
| 2:37:51| I think that motion is to adopt it on first reading. So do we have a second on that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9471)|
| 2:37:59| Okay, Ms. Bounds seconded that motion. Okay, so Ms. Henderson, did you want to speak to the policy J462?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9479)|
| 2:38:11| Yes, thank you. I just wanted to clarify some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9491)|
| 2:38:15| I think there was a misunderstanding among principals today that this was requiring them to change their current plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9495)|
| 2:38:22| or require them to have parents in attendance, and that is not the intention at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9502)|
| 2:38:27| I talked to many of the principals who were on that call today, and after I got off the phone with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9507)|
| 2:38:31| they did understand my intention from last week, which they were supportive of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9511)|
| 2:38:37| So I'm finding, and I've talked to parents every day, PTO presidents every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9517)|
| 2:38:44| and finding a disparity that some schools aren't doing the extent of activities that they normally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9524)|
| 2:38:51| And I understand these activities are different. I get that. And some schools are in a safe manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9531)|
| 2:38:56| So this just adds clarification to the current plans that principals can still do these activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9536)|
| 2:39:01| They're encouraged to do these activities, not required, not to change anything that they're currently doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9541)|
| 2:39:07| just to encourage those students to have these opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9547)|
| 2:39:10| A lot has been taken away from these kids this year, and this just adds clarity to add a little normalcy to their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9550)|
| 2:39:17| And my intention wasn't to require anything for them. I hope that helps a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9557)|
| 2:39:23| Okay, I think Ms. Bounds was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9563)|
| 2:39:30| Excuse me, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| Yes, I like the redirection that Ms. Henderson worked at from a reporting to complaints only on line eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9573)|
| 2:39:43| I did have a question as how this policy impacts parents and the community involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9583)|
| 2:39:48| because I did receive an email from one of my schools who was comfortable with the policy, but just for students only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9588)|
| 2:39:57| And to Ms. Henderson's point, I don't think this policy changes anything that the principals have already planned or are planning to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9597)|
| 2:40:08| I think it just strengthens it by letting them go forward with freedom to do so, because, as I mentioned earlier tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9608)|
| 2:40:18| there is still disparity on the playgrounds and some schools are requiring masks and some schools aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9618)|
| 2:40:24| So I think this just gives principals the freedom, and I would, if I heard you correctly, Ms. Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9624)|
| 2:40:31| this is basically for the students, not for parents and community involvement, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9631)|
| 2:40:38| Yes, Ms. Bounds, that is correct. And on direction of one of the principals I spoke with today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9638)|
| 2:40:43| I did add to the policy, which you all have a copy of, in the red line that says to accommodate student participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9643)|
| 2:40:51| That way it kind of clarifies this isn't, you know, parents can come into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9651)|
| 2:40:56| You know, it's for the students so that they can have these opportunities and activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9656)|
| 2:41:01| Thank you. I think Mr. McMillan was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9661)|
| 2:41:04| I just have a question. The last, very last line, if we're just worried about getting through this year, why does it say 21-22?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9664)|
| 2:41:22| Would we not be adopting this for, if it's adopted, would we not be adopting it for next school year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9682)|
| 2:41:31| I mean, I realize we could always rescind it, but why is the need to adopt it at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9691)|
| 2:41:38| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9698)|
| 2:41:40| Thank you, Mr. McMillan. I appreciate that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9700)|
| 2:41:43| The thought behind that was that if the current emergency COVID recommendations continue into next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9703)|
| 2:41:51| and that principals and administrators, that the activities were still different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9711)|
| 2:41:57| that this would still be in place so that they can still make sure that these activities are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9717)|
| 2:42:03| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9723)|
| 2:42:04| So as long as those recommendations, the emergency recommendations are in, I wanted to make sure it was covered with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9724)|
| 2:42:12| I see what you're saying, but as Ms. Bowns pointed out, I think there is, and there will, no matter what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9732)|
| 2:42:22| there will continue to be inconsistencies across the county because different administrators view it as, you know, different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9742)|
| 2:42:35| It's their interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9755)|
| 2:42:37| So for that reason, I'm not going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9757)|
| 2:42:40| I would support lifting mandates, I mean masks, any time, and I think we're at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9760)|
| 2:42:49| But that's just my opinion. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9769)|
| 2:42:52| Thank you, Mr. McMillan. I think Ms. Babb was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9772)|
| 2:42:55| Yeah, and I understand where Ms. Henderson's intent was on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9775)|
| 2:43:00| but I, unless I ask for opinions from my principals, I don't usually hear from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9780)|
| 2:43:05| and I got a lot of phone calls today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9785)|
| 2:43:08| I think, I know what your intent is, but I think from all of my principals I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9788)|
| 2:43:14| they are trying to do their best to do it as normal as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9794)|
| 2:43:17| and this policy, I think making it into policy is actually, they feel like kind of confusing the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9797)|
| 2:43:24| and, you know, they said right now we're in the midst of, you know, dealing with the testing and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9804)|
| 2:43:32| and, you know, I appreciated Ms. Nicely that talked about, like, let's have conversations this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| to make sure we're very clear on next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9816)|
| 2:43:39| But they just want to keep every, I just don't think that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| I don't feel personally that there is the need for the policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| From what I'm hearing from my principals, they are doing the fifth grade graduations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| They are doing the field days the best they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9828)|
| 2:43:51| and maybe they can't do everything because of a reason that they can't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| and maybe there needs to be a conversation with a particular school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| I personally don't feel like we need the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| and from kind of just these parents meeting, I mean, not parent meeting, principal meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9840)|
| 2:44:04| I was hearing, I think the principals are sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| I think they're talking to each other about how are you getting field day done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9846)|
| 2:44:10| How are you doing fifth grade graduation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| So I think there's already a lot of sharing among our principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9852)|
| 2:44:15| and I really think most of this is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9855)|
| 2:44:17| We're talking about the elementary level, even though the policy is for all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| But I support your intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9860)|
| 2:44:25| I probably just don't support the policy after talking about principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9865)|
| 2:44:29| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9869)|
| 2:44:30| And I'm not sure if Ms. Satterfield or Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9870)|
| 2:44:33| Ms. Satterfield, and then we'll go to Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9876)|
| 2:44:38| Going back to Mr. Mike's point about just the clarity of policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9878)|
| 2:44:41| and the confusion that it could bring, just even today in this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9881)|
| 2:44:46| last week I was fully in support of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9886)|
| 2:44:48| but then when I hear the principal's perspective and then hear your perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9888)|
| 2:44:52| and then hearing, talking from the principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9892)|
| 2:44:54| there's just too much confusion with 28 days left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9894)|
| 2:44:58| And I'm calling out every time I hear it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9898)|
| 2:45:01| Knox County Schools is rippled with disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9901)|
| 2:45:03| We haven't, we got 28 more days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| We can handle another 28 days with disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| Okay. Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9911)|
| 2:45:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9912)|
| 2:45:15| It seems to me that this is much more procedural than policy related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9915)|
| 2:45:20| and if something like this needs to be said to our principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9920)|
| 2:45:24| I think it would much more appropriately come from the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9924)|
| 2:45:27| than from policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9929)|
| 2:45:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9930)|
| 2:45:31| I think Ms. Christy was next, and then Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9931)|
| 2:45:34| Ms. Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9934)|
| 2:45:35| I was just going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| it sounds like our schools are already trying to do this as much as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9937)|
| 2:45:40| possible, and it might confuse things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9940)|
| 2:45:44| And I guess, Superintendent Thomas, what are your thoughts on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9944)|
| 2:45:49| I mean, there's nothing prohibiting schools from trying to have these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9949)|
| 2:45:54| activities, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9954)|
| 2:45:56| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9956)|
| 2:45:57| Within the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9957)|
| 2:45:58| We've tried to work with, of course, our grade level directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9958)|
| 2:46:01| and through our principals and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| to try to do as much, you know, as normal as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9963)|
| 2:46:06| still trying to maintain safety as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9966)|
| 2:46:09| But, yeah, we've tried to be as flexible with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9969)|
| 2:46:14| But, you know, if the board approves it, certainly we'll carry it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| I do feel like our principals and schools are doing everything that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9977)|
| 2:46:23| can possibly do, as Tana mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| to end this school year on a positive note and give students the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9985)|
| 2:46:29| opportunities that they've been used to getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9989)|
| 2:46:34| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| I'm sorry, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| You can call me Ms. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10000)|
| 2:46:41| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10001)|
| 2:46:42| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10002)|
| 2:46:43| It's all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| Ms. Henderson, I just wanted to say again from last week, I, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10005)|
| 2:46:48| completely understand where you're going and what your intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10008)|
| 2:46:51| And I think we want everybody to have a tremendous opportunity in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10011)|
| 2:46:54| Knox County Schools for all these different types of activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10014)|
| 2:46:57| I do think, to Ms. Owens' point, it is more procedural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10017)|
| 2:47:01| I did want to clarify something, Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10021)|
| 2:47:04| There is the section in line eight about complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10024)|
| 2:47:07| And I'm assuming that if there is a legitimate complaint that a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10027)|
| 2:47:11| has, could they not go to the ombudsman with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10031)|
| 2:47:15| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10035)|
| 2:47:18| That would be appropriate in bringing it through the great level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10038)|
| 2:47:21| the ombudsman or great level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10041)|
| 2:47:23| If they feel like they're not getting somewhere with their school staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10043)|
| 2:47:25| they could elevate that to the ombudsman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10045)|
| 2:47:27| It would need to, if it's something that's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10047)|
| 2:47:29| we're supposed to happen pretty soon, we can't sit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| So it would have to be dealt with pretty much immediately if it's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10052)|
| 2:47:35| activity that, you know, is within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10055)|
| 2:47:38| I just want to make that known to all of our constituents and parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10058)|
| 2:47:41| out there that for some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10061)|
| 2:47:43| for those who are not familiar with the role of ombudsman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10063)|
| 2:47:46| that is a place to take a complaint when you're not feeling like you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10066)|
| 2:47:50| getting where you need to get within your local school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10070)|
| 2:47:53| Definitely do that first and work with those principals and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10073)|
| 2:47:56| administrators and those teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10076)|
| 2:47:58| But that is a central place that you can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10078)|
| 2:48:01| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10083)|
| 2:48:04| I'm having trouble with names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| So sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10086)|
| 2:48:07| Looking at Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10087)|
| 2:48:09| Let's go with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10089)|
| 2:48:10| I just wanted to say again, you know, hearing from the parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10090)|
| 2:48:13| I just felt like I needed to take some action because these kids are only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10093)|
| 2:48:17| in fifth grade once and they lost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10097)|
| 2:48:18| because last year lost out on a lot of fifth grade activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10098)|
| 2:48:21| eighth grade activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10101)|
| 2:48:22| I didn't want to see that happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10102)|
| 2:48:24| And I am hearing from parents that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10104)|
| 2:48:26| it's the schools that is happening because principals just, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10106)|
| 2:48:31| to Ms. Bowne's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10111)|
| 2:48:32| this gives them the freedom to know that they can do these activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10112)|
| 2:48:35| And if it does pass, I agree with Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10115)|
| 2:48:39| I would change where it says sunset at the end of 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10119)|
| 2:48:43| 2022 school year to sun setting at the end of the emergency policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10123)|
| 2:48:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10130)|
| 2:48:52| So that would be your amended motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10132)|
| 2:48:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10136)|
| 2:48:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10137)|
| 2:48:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| And Ms. Bownes, are you okay with that amended motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10142)|
| 2:49:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10145)|
| 2:49:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10146)|
| 2:49:07| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10147)|
| 2:49:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10151)|
| 2:49:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10152)|
| 2:49:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| I would hope that people would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10154)|
| 2:49:16| that principals would want to do everything they could to try to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10156)|
| 2:49:19| as normal a school year ending as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| It's these kids don't get this time back to it, to adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10162)|
| 2:49:26| It's just a year, but to kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10166)|
| 2:49:27| it's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10167)|
| 2:49:28| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10168)|
| 2:49:29| so I appreciate your thoughts behind trying to encourage principals to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10169)|
| 2:49:34| have a normal ending of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10174)|
| 2:49:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10177)|
| 2:49:38| If there, do you have any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10178)|
| 2:49:40| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10180)|
| 2:49:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10181)|
| 2:49:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10182)|
| 2:49:43| Any, any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10183)|
| 2:49:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10184)|
| 2:49:45| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10185)|
| 2:49:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10190)|
| 2:49:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10191)|
| 2:49:56| If you're opposed, we can do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10196)|
| 2:49:58| If that's easier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10198)|
| 2:49:59| I thought we could do a voice vote because I thought I knew the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10199)|
| 2:50:02| people were going to vote, but if we want to do a roll call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10202)|
| 2:50:04| that's totally fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10204)|
| 2:50:05| So a yes vote would be in support of making this a new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10205)|
| 2:50:10| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10210)|
| 2:50:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10211)|
| 2:50:12| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10212)|
| 2:50:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10213)|
| 2:50:14| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10214)|
| 2:50:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10215)|
| 2:50:16| Ms. Batt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10216)|
| 2:50:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10217)|
| 2:50:18| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10218)|
| 2:50:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10219)|
| 2:50:20| Ms. Bownes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10220)|
| 2:50:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10221)|
| 2:50:22| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10222)|
| 2:50:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10223)|
| 2:50:24| Ms. Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10224)|
| 2:50:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10225)|
| 2:50:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10226)|
| 2:50:27| So the policy fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10227)|
| 2:50:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10230)|
| 2:50:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10231)|
| 2:50:32| And now we go back to our last policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10232)|
| 2:50:36| That is, I think it's 240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10236)|
| 2:50:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10238)|
| 2:50:39| J240?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10239)|
| 2:50:41| Is that the right number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10241)|
| 2:50:44| C240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10244)|
| 2:50:45| C240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10245)|
| 2:50:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10246)|
| 2:50:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10247)|
| 2:50:48| So we have the motion on the floor for, we don't have a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10248)|
| 2:50:53| so I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10253)|
| 2:50:54| Ms. Coatney, would you like to read them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10254)|
| 2:50:56| Approve first reading of Knox County Board of Education Policy C240| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10256)|
| 2:51:00| face coverings as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10260)|
| 2:51:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10262)|
| 2:51:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10265)|
| 2:51:06| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10266)|
| 2:51:07| I make a motion to suspend Board Policy B200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10267)|
| 2:51:10| Policy Development and Adoption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10270)|
| 2:51:12| and the requirement for two readings on this policy and to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10272)|
| 2:51:15| Board Policy C240 face coverings as amended on one reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10275)|
| 2:51:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10280)|
| 2:51:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10285)|
| 2:51:26| Do we have a policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10286)|
| 2:51:27| Do we have a, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10287)|
| 2:51:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10299)|
| 2:51:40| So we have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10300)|
| 2:51:44| Rather than the motion listed on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10304)|
| 2:51:46| we have a substitute motion to approve the policy and also suspend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10306)|
| 2:51:51| the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10311)|
| 2:51:53| What was the policy relative to first and second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10313)|
| 2:51:57| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| Yeah, to just waive first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10320)|
| 2:52:01| Waive first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10321)|
| 2:52:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10322)|
| 2:52:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10325)|
| 2:52:06| So we have a, we have a motion by Ms. Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10326)|
| 2:52:10| a second by Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10330)|
| 2:52:12| So the, essentially we have the face covering policy that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10332)|
| 2:52:19| attached to your agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10339)|
| 2:52:20| and the motion that has been made is such that if we approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10340)|
| 2:52:25| policy, it would be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10345)|
| 2:52:28| We would waive second, second, first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10348)|
| 2:52:30| we would do waive first reading the way it's read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10350)|
| 2:52:35| Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10355)|
| 2:52:36| We would waive first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| Does that make sense to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10358)|
| 2:52:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10360)|
| 2:52:41| So regarding the policy, I think Ms. Bounds was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10361)|
| 2:52:48| Or Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10368)|
| 2:52:49| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10369)|
| 2:52:50| Mr. McMillan, were you first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10370)|
| 2:52:52| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10372)|
| 2:52:53| We were just talking about being confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10373)|
| 2:52:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10376)|
| 2:52:57| Does it make sense now, the way she made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10377)|
| 2:52:59| Explain to me what, what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10379)|
| 2:53:04| Are we voting for masks, against masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10384)|
| 2:53:07| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10387)|
| 2:53:08| So policy C240 that Ms. Henderson has proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10388)|
| 2:53:12| I believe says that the mask policy would sunset August 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10392)|
| 2:53:18| In her motion, she also is recommending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10398)|
| 2:53:22| or the motion includes waiving first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10402)|
| 2:53:25| Is this it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10405)|
| 2:53:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10407)|
| 2:53:28| It's attached to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10408)|
| 2:53:30| I don't think we have a hard copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10410)|
| 2:53:33| Mr. Duport, did I state that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10415)|
| 2:53:36| That's very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10416)|
| 2:53:37| I don't think we, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10417)|
| 2:53:38| we typically do not waive first reading on a board policy when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10418)|
| 2:53:42| we're reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10422)|
| 2:53:43| So I think that is confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10423)|
| 2:53:44| I don't really care about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10424)|
| 2:53:46| But that's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10426)|
| 2:53:47| I'm going to vote against it, so just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10427)|
| 2:53:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10431)|
| 2:53:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10432)|
| 2:53:53| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10433)|
| 2:53:54| I have a question for Mr. Duport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| Do we need to discuss this completely through me with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10437)|
| 2:54:02| waiving the second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10442)|
| 2:54:05| If I want to make a friendly amendment to her motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10445)|
| 2:54:11| do I do it after we vote on that motion or do I do it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10451)|
| 2:54:16| Mr. Duport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10456)|
| 2:54:17| To make things more confusing for Mr. Duport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10457)|
| 2:54:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10461)|
| 2:54:22| Thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10462)|
| 2:54:23| So you've got a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10463)|
| 2:54:26| Really, you've got one motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10466)|
| 2:54:28| which is to waive first reading that goes along with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10468)|
| 2:54:32| amendment to this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10472)|
| 2:54:34| So, Ms. Bounds, if you want to make an amended motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10474)|
| 2:54:38| whether it's friendly or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10478)|
| 2:54:40| my recommendation would be to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10480)|
| 2:54:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10482)|
| 2:54:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10483)|
| 2:54:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10484)|
| 2:54:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10485)|
| 2:54:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10487)|
| 2:54:48| I would like to make a friendly amendment with a date change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10488)|
| 2:54:52| this policy will sunset on May 31st rather than August 1st to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10492)|
| 2:54:56| correspond with the ending of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10496)|
| 2:55:00| So that would be my friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10500)|
| 2:55:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10502)|
| 2:55:03| To change the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10503)|
| 2:55:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10504)|
| 2:55:05| To May 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10505)|
| 2:55:06| Ms. Henderson, are you agreeable to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10506)|
| 2:55:08| I'm agreeable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10508)|
| 2:55:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10509)|
| 2:55:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10510)|
| 2:55:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10511)|
| 2:55:12| Ms. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10512)|
| 2:55:14| Ms. Henderson, are you agreeable to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10514)|
| 2:55:16| I'm agreeable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10516)|
| 2:55:17| And just to clarify for Mr. McMillan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10517)|
| 2:55:21| so this policy is the math policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10521)|
| 2:55:25| So what I would like to see is for this current policy to end on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10525)|
| 2:55:30| May 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10530)|
| 2:55:32| So if you agree with the policy, you agree for it to end on May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10532)|
| 2:55:35| 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10535)|
| 2:55:36| So that way it's not a policy in existence anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10536)|
| 2:55:41| We'll have math until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10541)|
| 2:55:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10545)|
| 2:55:46| And ending this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10546)|
| 2:55:48| This policy will go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| What happens when we get into graduation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10550)|
| 2:55:53| Do we require, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10553)|
| 2:55:56| The superintendent's plan would take over at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10556)|
| 2:55:59| But that way this policy would end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10559)|
| 2:56:01| So let's say five years from now and somebody tried to reinstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10561)|
| 2:56:06| this policy, it wouldn't be in existence anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10566)|
| 2:56:09| I would refer it to you in May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10569)|
| 2:56:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10573)|
| 2:56:14| All graduations are outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10574)|
| 2:56:16| So I think that takes care of the math question for graduations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10576)|
| 2:56:21| Since graduations take place out of doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| Does that help clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10584)|
| 2:56:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10587)|
| 2:56:28| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10588)|
| 2:56:29| Going to be outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10589)|
| 2:56:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10590)|
| 2:56:31| I saw the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10591)|
| 2:56:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10593)|
| 2:56:34| So just to clarify and so we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10594)|
| 2:56:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10597)|
| 2:56:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10598)|
| 2:56:39| I'm always quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10602)|
| 2:56:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10603)|
| 2:56:44| I can support this policy as is for August 1st for the next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10604)|
| 2:56:49| I cannot support this policy for May because we have summer school and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10609)|
| 2:56:53| have kids enrolled in summer school already and parents have already made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10613)|
| 2:56:56| that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10616)|
| 2:56:57| Teachers have already made their plans and we don't need to disrupt them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10617)|
| 2:57:01| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10621)|
| 2:57:02| We just need to keep pushing through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10624)|
| 2:57:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10625)|
| 2:57:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10626)|
| 2:57:07| Let's just go down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10627)|
| 2:57:08| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10628)|
| 2:57:09| I can say almost the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| The other thing is I would like to vote separately whether to waive first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10631)|
| 2:57:15| reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10635)|
| 2:57:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10636)|
| 2:57:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10637)|
| 2:57:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10638)|
| 2:57:19| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10639)|
| 2:57:20| Mrs. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10640)|
| 2:57:21| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10641)|
| 2:57:22| It's all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10642)|
| 2:57:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10643)|
| 2:57:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10645)|
| 2:57:26| Let me get my thoughts back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10646)|
| 2:57:29| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| So I think it's important to understand that the vote that just was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10650)|
| 2:57:35| approved doesn't actually get instituted for the 21-22 calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10655)|
| 2:57:40| And so if we sunset this May 31st, that means in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10660)|
| 2:57:44| So the guidelines we just approved does have face coverings as a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10664)|
| 2:57:48| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10668)|
| 2:57:49| If we sunset it May 31st, there's a two-month window where we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10669)|
| 2:57:53| which seems to be really inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| We're going from mask to no mask to mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| I mean, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10677)|
| 2:57:58| So I would not be in approval of doing it May 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10678)|
| 2:58:01| But Superintendent Thomas, I do have a technical question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10681)|
| 2:58:04| And I think it's important to retrace a little bit of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10684)|
| 2:58:07| So, and it won't be long, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10687)|
| 2:58:10| So when you first brought your reopening plan, so I wasn't on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10690)|
| 2:58:14| board at the time, but from my viewing of those meetings, you brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10694)|
| 2:58:18| that plan and the intent at that time when you brought it from my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10698)|
| 2:58:21| understanding of the minutes was it was not going to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10701)|
| 2:58:24| It was decided in the context of a meeting to vote on it and to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10704)|
| 2:58:28| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10708)|
| 2:58:29| And then the following meeting, I think it was Ms. Satterfield brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10709)|
| 2:58:32| this policy to bring clarity around the issue and how the implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10712)|
| 2:58:37| of masks would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10717)|
| 2:58:39| So my, I think the idea that we're going to keep masks for as long as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10719)|
| 2:58:44| the Tennessee Health Department says that we are in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10724)|
| 2:58:47| guidance is clear and what we just approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210414?start=10727)|
