| 2:39:37| And three years ago, when I offered the free clinic, I wrote a four-major drug company district manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9577)|
| 2:39:44| We are going to do all free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9584)|
| 2:39:45| Can you help for free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9585)|
| 2:39:46| I did not hear anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| And then four months later, I heard from Target down in St. Peter's, Florida, Walmart, and the $4 thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9588)|
| 2:39:56| Oh, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9596)|
| 2:39:57| So all my patients are able to pay less than $4, $10 for medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9597)|
| 2:40:02| So totally free clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9602)|
| 2:40:07| Only another thing is we are seeing many patients turned down from Interphase, Cherokee Health System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9607)|
| 2:40:14| and Knox County Health Department because they are using sliding scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9614)|
| 2:40:18| But we are accepting everybody, only American citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9618)|
| 2:40:22| and also going to be an American citizen with a green card holder and working people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9622)|
| 2:40:28| You have to show the way you work and how much you're making money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9628)|
| 2:40:31| So you've got to be an American citizen, to be an American citizen, and working people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9631)|
| 2:40:36| And we try to keep these people and their family members well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9636)|
| 2:40:42| Because it is so impossible to go to see a medical doctor's hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9642)|
| 2:40:49| because, for instance, one single mother working at McDonald's, $6.80,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9649)|
| 2:40:54| there's no way you pay the buy-in insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9654)|
| 2:40:58| I figured it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9658)|
| 2:40:59| There's more than 8,000 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| Fast food restaurant employees don't have it, except one manager's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9661)|
| 2:41:06| Even subway, even district managers don't have medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9666)|
| 2:41:10| Everybody is uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9670)|
| 2:41:13| And this clinic, I'm really proud of it, opened in 1993.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9673)|
| 2:41:19| It's not 3 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9679)|
| 2:41:20| It's 15 years old, and everything is totally free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9680)|
| 2:41:26| And I went to Washington, D.C. a year ago to try to change their ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9686)|
| 2:41:33| Human Health Administration Department, and we sat and talked 2 1‚ÅÑ2 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9693)|
| 2:41:38| I didn't come here for fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9698)|
| 2:41:39| I wanted to change the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9699)|
| 2:41:41| Here's a group not even collecting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9701)|
| 2:41:44| Why don't you give us money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| And here again, Knoxville is a great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9706)|
| 2:41:50| I've been here since 1979.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| And we have a lot of research, a lot of doctors, a lot of nurses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9713)|
| 2:41:58| lots of volunteers, a lot of rich people, also a lot of poor people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9718)|
| 2:42:04| But if you have these ideas, my palm, one day, one doctor, one patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9724)|
| 2:42:12| one church, one dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| I didn't come here for a million-dollar fund, just one dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9734)|
| 2:42:18| If one of our citizens pays, donates a free clinic, one dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9738)|
| 2:42:22| I get about half a million right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9742)|
| 2:42:25| So I did not come here for really crying baby like, hey, why didn't I get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9745)|
| 2:42:30| But I came here for my volunteers and my patients because we turn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9750)|
| 2:42:35| We don't get anything because we do a lot of things which other institutions turn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9755)|
| 2:42:41| So I'd like to close this comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9761)|
| 2:42:45| You're going to hear next week a so sad story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9765)|
| 2:42:48| One of my patients looking for medical attention, and no one did it, and the state didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9768)|
| 2:42:55| So she heard about going to Bangkok to have a hysterectomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9775)|
| 2:42:58| Came here, had a complication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9778)|
| 2:43:01| And this is where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9781)|
| 2:43:03| So I really appreciate you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| If you have any medical issue, please talk to Richard Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9786)|
| 2:43:11| He's very energetic, and he knows what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9791)|
| 2:43:14| And also, Chairman Tank is going to be telling, because he's having treatment every other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9794)|
| 2:43:21| If he's sitting down in that dialysis chair, he thinks about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9801)|
| 2:43:26| if I don't have an issue, where do I go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| So if you have any questions, come to my office and spend it with me one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9808)|
| 2:43:33| You'll know what kind of people are coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| There's working people, just don't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9815)|
| 2:43:38| And if you have any questions, I'd like to entertain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9818)|
| 2:43:44| Commissioner Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| Yes, Dr. Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9826)|
| 2:43:47| I wanted to know what your budget was a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| Really, I was a business manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| I'm a doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9833)|
| 2:43:54| I'm a nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9834)|
| 2:43:55| I'm a janitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9835)|
| 2:43:56| I'm everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9836)|
| 2:43:58| And the budget, about half a million, less than half a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9838)|
| 2:44:02| What I want to get out of the budget for this coming, because I want to expand it to my old office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9842)|
| 2:44:08| get family, I mean physician assistant or nursing practitioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9848)|
| 2:44:14| so we can see another 50 patients a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9854)|
| 2:44:18| The unique is the whole point is a person who cannot go to the doctor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9858)|
| 2:44:23| we can see within three days, within one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| We're not even waiting for one month or two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9865)|
| 2:44:28| So this is a tremendous mission, and everybody loves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9868)|
| 2:44:34| So particularly the economy, because I don't know, but it's, I think, a half a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9874)|
| 2:44:40| Well, I want to thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9880)|
| 2:44:44| Thank you, Dr. Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9884)|
| 2:44:46| Hope Resource Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9886)|
| 2:44:59| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9899)|
| 2:45:00| While I'm introducing myself, Scott Hughes, our executive director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9900)|
| 2:45:03| is handing out just a one-page of bullet points of our application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9903)|
| 2:45:07| I assume that you have not seen the full application that we presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9907)|
| 2:45:11| and I just wanted to cover that briefly with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9911)|
| 2:45:14| My name is Tamara Oynbee, and I'm the director of development for Hope Resource Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9914)|
| 2:45:18| And we fall in line behind the medical clinic and the interfaith health clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9918)|
| 2:45:23| in the fact that we provide medical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| We do not provide them on a sliding scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9926)|
| 2:45:29| We provide all of our services free of charge in a nondiscriminatory environment, nonjudgmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9929)|
| 2:45:36| and we are the area's crisis pregnancy clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9936)|
| 2:45:40| Our annual budget is $1,527,385.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9940)|
| 2:45:47| Of that, $667,000 is in grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9947)|
| 2:45:51| and of that we receive a large federal grant totaling $617,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9951)|
| 2:45:58| And that grant is to provide abstinence-based sex education in all of the Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9958)|
| 2:46:04| middle and high school, and in 12 other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9964)|
| 2:46:08| But that's not what our grant application was for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9968)|
| 2:46:12| We applied for $30,000 to help with the medical services that we provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9972)|
| 2:46:20| We asked for $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9980)|
| 2:46:22| We were recommended for $25,125, which is less than 2% of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9982)|
| 2:46:29| We are not asking Knox County to fund a large portion of our budget or to prop us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9989)|
| 2:46:35| We're just asking you to stand alongside of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9995)|
| 2:46:38| And part of the arguments for our request is that one of our largest referral sources is the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9998)|
| 2:46:46| Again, we do not charge for our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10006)|
| 2:46:49| And for a lady who is pregnant to receive a proof of pregnancy form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10009)|
| 2:46:54| which is the form that you need to get on TennCare and get that very vital first trimester care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10014)|
| 2:47:00| it costs $50 at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| We can't afford that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10023)|
| 2:47:04| They're sent to us, and we provide that free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10024)|
| 2:47:07| So we feel that we are stepping forward and serving those citizens that you simply can't afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10027)|
| 2:47:14| The majority of our clients are Knox County residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10034)|
| 2:47:17| We have a location on Painter Avenue, and then we also have one in the heart of UT campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10037)|
| 2:47:24| And the folks that are non-Knox County citizens are because they're on the campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10044)|
| 2:47:30| and they're from other counties as a university student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10050)|
| 2:47:35| In our application, we included a letter of reference from Wendy Vermillion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10055)|
| 2:47:41| who is the public health representative and HIV prevention coordinator for the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10061)|
| 2:47:50| Also included in our application packet is an article from the Knoxville News Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10070)|
| 2:47:55| stating that Tennessee ranks in the top ten for STDs such as syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10075)|
| 2:48:03| All of those are treatable, and we provide that treatment and testing free of charge at our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10083)|
| 2:48:10| Also in our application is a report from the Center for Disease Control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10090)|
| 2:48:15| which states that STDs remain a major public health challenge in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10095)|
| 2:48:21| Approximately 19 million new infections occur each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10101)|
| 2:48:24| and that these represent a tremendous economic toll estimated to be $14.7 billion annually in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10104)|
| 2:48:35| The CDC report recommends testing, treatment, and education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10115)|
| 2:48:39| and Hope Resource Center provides all of that free of charge to our Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10119)|
| 2:48:44| And with the education component that every client we receive that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10124)|
| 2:48:49| receives educational information about these STDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10129)|
| 2:48:53| we're hoping that as they move forward they'll make wiser decisions in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10133)|
| 2:48:57| to stop the spread of some of these diseases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10137)|
| 2:49:03| Because we do not charge for any of our services, the need for financial support is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10143)|
| 2:49:10| Again, this represents less than 2% of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10150)|
| 2:49:14| We also have a wide base of support from churches, individuals, business owners, foundations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10154)|
| 2:49:19| our annual fund drives, our special events, and we also receive in-kind donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10159)|
| 2:49:26| One that stands out in my mind is Mercy Health Partners, who does a lot of our lab work for free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10166)|
| 2:49:32| and that's in excess of $60,000 a year that they help us defray costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10172)|
| 2:49:38| We are experienced in this field with over 11 years serving Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10178)|
| 2:49:46| Again, we're not asking you to fund our budget or to prop up this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10186)|
| 2:49:50| We're asking you to stand alongside us as we serve the Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10190)|
| 2:49:55| We work closely with the WIC office and the CDC office, as well as the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10195)|
| 2:50:02| And I ask that you fund our recommendations as suggested by the Citizens Review Panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10202)|
| 2:50:09| I know they invested a lot of time in that process, and I know it was their first year trying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10209)|
| 2:50:15| And, yes, I could make some recommendations on how that could be streamlined or improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10215)|
| 2:50:20| but I do think it was a valid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10220)|
| 2:50:22| I think they had a genuine interest in doing what's best for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10222)|
| 2:50:28| I'd like to invite every one of you down for a tour of our office just to see what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10228)|
| 2:50:32| It's so hard to encapsulate it in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10232)|
| 2:50:37| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10237)|
| 2:50:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10241)|
| 2:50:42| Thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10242)|
| 2:50:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10243)|
| 2:50:47| East Tennessee Television and Film Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10247)|
| 2:51:05| Thank you for having us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| I'm Helen Short, and I'm the chair of the East Tennessee Television and Film Commission Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10267)|
| 2:51:12| And we are here to ask for reconsideration of funding from County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10272)|
| 2:51:19| We are a 501C3 chartered organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10279)|
| 2:51:24| We are a partner at this time with the Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10284)|
| 2:51:28| They provide location of offices and administrative services for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10288)|
| 2:51:37| You have funded us generously in the past few years, and we have really appreciated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10297)|
| 2:51:43| This past year we received $110,000 in funding from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10303)|
| 2:51:51| When the community grants were finished and we discovered we had no funding at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10311)|
| 2:51:59| we were a little surprised because with that $110,000 investment in 2006-2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10319)|
| 2:52:06| we returned over $2 million in economic impact to Knox County with the productions that have been done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10326)|
| 2:52:17| So we'd like to explain a little more about what we do to you all and see if we can expect some help from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10337)|
| 2:52:26| The Film Commission provides a single point of contact for anyone that is looking to bring a production,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10346)|
| 2:52:32| a television commercial, a made-for-television movie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10352)|
| 2:52:39| anything that they are looking for that impacts both television and film into Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10359)|
| 2:52:46| We provide contact for local producers, for scouts, for production companies, for actors, for crews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10366)|
| 2:52:56| We handle permitting services for anyone that is coming into the county or city to produce one of these entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10376)|
| 2:53:08| And we have also done a lot of community education in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10388)|
| 2:53:13| In 2005-2006 we produced a program called The Line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10393)|
| 2:53:19| which started with middle school and high school students producing films as part of classroom structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10399)|
| 2:53:27| The film that won the line contest actually went on to win a national student film festival award as best in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10407)|
| 2:53:41| So we're pretty proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10421)|
| 2:53:43| We also have provided a lot of community education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10423)|
| 2:53:47| This year we sponsored a trade association asking vendors who provide the latest in technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10427)|
| 2:53:55| including cameras, software, et cetera, to come in and meet with our local folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10435)|
| 2:54:00| so that they are aware of how fast the technology is changing so that they can see the new equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10440)|
| 2:54:07| understand how it can be used because we feel part of our responsibility is to provide a committed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10447)|
| 2:54:15| caring, well-educated workforce for the production company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10455)|
| 2:54:21| And I think we're all aware of how big production is here in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10461)|
| 2:54:26| Currently we have 10 projects that are pending that are looking at coming to Knox County and surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10466)|
| 2:54:34| Will all of them come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| We don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10476)|
| 2:54:38| We hope they will, but probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10478)|
| 2:54:40| But we will get some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10480)|
| 2:54:42| Today Thomas Duncan, who is our project coordinator, is out with two companies scouting locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10482)|
| 2:54:50| and meeting with some of the production companies here on some independent films that are looking to produce in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10490)|
| 2:54:58| We have also worked with UT and Pellissippi State and helped them work out an articulation agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10498)|
| 2:55:05| that allowed courses to be transferred between schools and to help improve both programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10505)|
| 2:55:12| So we would really like to ask for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10512)|
| 2:55:16| With all of this business that's still outstanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10516)|
| 2:55:19| we are in the position of saying in two weeks or three weeks that we have no money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10519)|
| 2:55:25| we cannot continue helping you with these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10525)|
| 2:55:28| and I would hate to see that kind of business slip away from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10528)|
| 2:55:32| Do you have any questions for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10534)|
| 2:55:37| I have a few comments and a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10537)|
| 2:55:42| It really doesn't surprise me that the community grants panel chose not to fund this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10542)|
| 2:55:50| This is not a community grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10550)|
| 2:55:53| This is a function of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10553)|
| 2:55:56| It's an economic development tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10556)|
| 2:55:59| When you judge a charity by the same criteria that you judge an economic development tool like the Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10559)|
| 2:56:08| or like the Tourism and Sports Corporation or like the Film Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10568)|
| 2:56:14| there's not a charity in this town that is going to measure up very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10574)|
| 2:56:18| if you measure them with an economic development yardstick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10578)|
| 2:56:23| On the same token, if you judge an economic development tool like the Film Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10583)|
| 2:56:29| by the same criteria that you would a cultural event or a charity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10589)|
| 2:56:35| it's not going to measure up very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10595)|
| 2:56:38| I think that the community grants, you know, I think that they scored it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10598)|
| 2:56:43| according to the criteria that they were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10603)|
| 2:56:46| I think that it's simply been a drop on Knox County Government's part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10606)|
| 2:56:51| that this should have never been included into community grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10611)|
| 2:56:54| that this should have always been a line item in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10614)|
| 2:56:59| I think that we should fund the Film Commission with a line item in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10619)|
| 2:57:05| This is a function of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10625)|
| 2:57:07| and this is one of our fastest-growing growth industries in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10627)|
| 2:57:12| Furthermore, I've got a couple of ideas that I would like to ask you folks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10632)|
| 2:57:17| and some other folks in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10637)|
| 2:57:21| When I look at a Film Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| and I look at the type of economic development that they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10643)|
| 2:57:27| you're dealing with creative entities, local production companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10647)|
| 2:57:32| and you're dealing with a lot of out-of-town folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10652)|
| 2:57:35| that are going to come into town for a short time and work on a project and then leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10655)|
| 2:57:42| When I look at the Chamber Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10662)|
| 2:57:45| I see an economic development entity that works on building long-term economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10665)|
| 2:57:53| bricks-and-mortar type issues of bringing factories and things to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10673)|
| 2:57:58| And then I also look at our Tourism and Sports Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10678)|
| 2:58:03| dealing an awful lot with entertainment industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10683)|
| 2:58:06| with folks that are going to come to town, do a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10686)|
| 2:58:11| have a tremendous economic impact on the local economy while they're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10691)|
| 2:58:16| and then they're going to leave again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10696)|
| 2:58:19| Looking at it like that, I'm wondering if we fund the Film Commission through a line item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10699)|
| 2:58:27| and we do start looking at this as a function of government and as a part of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10707)|
| 2:58:32| how would you feel about moving your offices from the Chamber Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10712)|
| 2:58:39| to the Tourism and Sports Corporation and having access to some of their resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10719)|
| 2:58:45| And I'd also like to hear from Gloria Ray and Mike Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10725)|
| 2:58:48| I'd like to see if Gloria has the resources to make available to the Film Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10728)|
| 2:58:55| Commissioner Lambert, this is just a listening piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10735)|
| 2:59:00| We will get into that at a later time, but I'll let you go ahead and answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10740)|
| 2:59:06| I'm going to defer the question to David Metz because I sit on both boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10746)|
| 2:59:11| I'm on both the Film Commission Board and the KTSC Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10751)|
| 2:59:16| Thanks, Helen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10756)|
| 2:59:17| My name is David Metz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10757)|
| 2:59:18| I'm Vice President, Senior Vice President of Production Operations at Scripps Networks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10758)|
| 2:59:21| and I'm Vice Chair of the Tennessee East Tennessee Television and Film Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10761)|
| 2:59:26| Mr. Commissioner, I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10766)|
| 2:59:29| I would say to you that one comment I would make is that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10769)|
| 2:59:34| there are some external production entities that do come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10774)|
| 2:59:37| They may be viewed as being here for a short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10777)|
| 2:59:40| but I'd also say to you that most production entities are not once and done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10780)|
| 2:59:44| Producers have a tendency to continue to produce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10784)|
| 2:59:47| and if they come into a community such as Knox County, have a good experience with the crew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10787)|
| 2:59:52| the location, and so on and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10792)|
| 2:59:54| it's conceivable that they could come back on a regular interval to produce their next project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10794)|
| 2:59:58| their next movie, their next commercial, their next public service announcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10798)|
| 3:00:01| their next program, whatever it is maybe that they're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10801)|
| 3:00:04| Yeah, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10804)|
| 3:00:05| Would you be okay with a move, and I also thought about maybe to move under this roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10805)|
| 3:00:11| to where it was actually in the courthouse, and as I thought about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10811)|
| 3:00:15| and, again, I'm not an expert on the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10815)|
| 3:00:18| I'm extremely interested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10818)|
| 3:00:20| Would you feel that it would be a bad idea to move to the Tourism and Sports Corporation building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10820)|
| 3:00:27| I don't know that we're in a position to really answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10827)|
| 3:00:29| I think it's something that we could take under advisement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10829)|
| 3:00:31| I think, frankly, having heard it today for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10831)|
| 3:00:34| I would believe that the board of directors of the organization would want to at least discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10834)|
| 3:00:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10838)|
| 3:00:41| Seeing no other questions, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10843)|

| 3:01:13| We have a governing board of directors which directs our program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10873)|
| 3:01:17| and funding to better serve the 22,000 individuals with Alzheimer's living in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10877)|
| 3:01:26| I don't know how many of you all have had experience with Alzheimer's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10886)|
| 3:01:31| but it is a devastating disease that truly robs our seniors of much of their independence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10891)|
| 3:01:40| and their ability to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10900)|
| 3:01:43| I want to share with you today, you all have been partners in much of the work of the association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10903)|
| 3:01:49| and I want to share with you a little bit about an adult daycare program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10909)|
| 3:01:54| When my mom had Alzheimer's and she lived with the disease for 12 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10914)|
| 3:01:59| we wanted to care for her at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10919)|
| 3:02:03| We wanted her to stay in the home that she had shared with my father for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10923)|
| 3:02:08| And we were able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10928)|
| 3:02:09| This was before I started working for the association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| By utilizing an adult daycare program two or three days a week at St. Mary's Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10933)|
| 3:02:19| they no longer offer that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10939)|
| 3:02:22| And when I finished with that experience and my mom did stay at home through her entire journey of Alzheimer's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10942)|
| 3:02:29| I pledged that my family had been able to honor my mom and my father as we are commanded to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10949)|
| 3:02:37| and that I would turn around and make sure that others could utilize those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10957)|
| 3:02:42| The Alzheimer's Association conducts many needs assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10962)|
| 3:02:47| so that we can really understand the true needs of the community which we strive to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10967)|
| 3:02:53| One of the things that is a critical need that came out from our needs assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10973)|
| 3:02:58| not only in Knox County but it's true certainly across East Tennessee as well as the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10978)|
| 3:03:04| was a critical need for adult daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10984)|
| 3:03:07| If you're not familiar with adult daycare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10987)|
| 3:03:10| it is a lifeline to the 70% of people with Alzheimer's who are cared for at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10990)|
| 3:03:18| by unbelievable sacrifice by their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=10998)|
| 3:03:22| Families knit together this family support system that allows their loved one to stay at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11002)|
| 3:03:29| But in order to do so, many times they need some assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11009)|
| 3:03:34| It's hard to care for a person 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11014)|
| 3:03:39| Adult daycare really offers that type of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| The glaring thing that came back from the needs assessment was if you could afford to pay $55 or $60 a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11023)|
| 3:03:51| for adult daycare, there are some services in the community that you could utilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11031)|
| 3:03:57| or perhaps have someone come into the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11037)|
| 3:04:00| But if you couldn't afford to pay that, you were really at a loss for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11040)|
| 3:04:06| So we really aimed this particular program at being affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11046)|
| 3:04:11| and also sliding scale and offer for folks who are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11051)|
| 3:04:16| but can't afford to pay for adult daycare to be able to utilize the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11056)|
| 3:04:21| It's a relatively new program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11061)|
| 3:04:24| It's called the Howard Circle of Friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11064)|
| 3:04:26| And as I said, we really aim to serve an underserved community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11066)|
| 3:04:32| It operates Monday through Friday from 7.30 to 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11072)|
| 3:04:38| And that really aims so that people in the workforce, caregivers tend to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11078)|
| 3:04:43| about 60% of caregivers have to leave their jobs to take care of a loved one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11083)|
| 3:04:48| because they have no one to assist them in their care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11088)|
| 3:04:52| So we wanted to get at folks who are trying to stay in the workplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11092)|
| 3:04:55| but couldn't afford services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11095)|
| 3:04:57| We charge for full service, we've charged $35 a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11097)|
| 3:05:01| but about 70% of the folks that are utilizing the program are on a sliding scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11101)|
| 3:05:09| It cost us about $80 a day to actually provide that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11109)|
| 3:05:16| So the Alzheimer's Association conducts special events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11116)|
| 3:05:19| and we look for grants and in-kind opportunities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11119)|
| 3:05:25| Our seniors are brought to the adult daycare program, which operates out of a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11125)|
| 3:05:31| We don't pay any rent for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11131)|
| 3:05:33| We're fortunate to have Mount Calvary offering their church and their space at no cost to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11133)|
| 3:05:40| And we provide wonderful activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11140)|
| 3:05:44| We know how folks can function at the very highest possible level in a supportive environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11144)|
| 3:05:51| We treat them with dignity and with respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11151)|
| 3:05:55| And in that situation, they certainly still have much to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11155)|
| 3:06:00| I want to call on Linda Johnson, who works with our families in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11160)|
| 3:06:07| You received a brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11167)|
| 3:06:09| And we just wanted a couple of our families just to make a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11169)|
| 3:06:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11176)|
| 3:06:17| I'm Linda Johnson, the Assistant Director of Programs for the Alzheimer's Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11177)|
| 3:06:21| And as Janet said, the majority of our families are working families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11181)|
| 3:06:26| and this is the only outlet that they have for their loved one is to come to the daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11186)|
| 3:06:32| We have individuals who drop their loved ones off on their way to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11192)|
| 3:06:37| and then pick them up on their way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11197)|
| 3:06:39| Just the other day we had a family where there was a mother-in-law and a son-in-law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11199)|
| 3:06:45| who have both been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11205)|
| 3:06:48| So they will come to the daycare together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11208)|
| 3:06:51| So those are the kind of families that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11211)|
| 3:06:53| Everyone has usually a working need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11213)|
| 3:06:57| families that it's an elderly spouse taking care of a spouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11217)|
| 3:07:02| And at this time I'd like to introduce LaJuan Davis and Amy Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11222)|
| 3:07:07| Just very brief comments, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11227)|
| 3:07:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11229)|
| 3:07:11| I had a prepared speech, but I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11231)|
| 3:07:15| My mother belongs to Howard Circle of Friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11235)|
| 3:07:19| She does have Alzheimer's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11239)|
| 3:07:20| She's been out for a minute now because she broke her back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11240)|
| 3:07:25| But without Howard Circle of Friends, I would not be able to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11245)|
| 3:07:29| She would not have a place that she could go to that would be dignified and respected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11249)|
| 3:07:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11257)|
| 3:07:39| I am now having to move her into my home eventually because she cannot stay by herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11259)|
| 3:07:44| And the reason being is that Alzheimer's, she's not going to get her mind back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11264)|
| 3:07:49| But at Howard Circle of Friends, they treat her like she does have a mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11269)|
| 3:07:53| And they do the things with her that build her up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11273)|
| 3:07:56| And it's just not a warehouse for someone that has no memory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11276)|
| 3:08:01| or that it cannot do to just go and sit all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11281)|
| 3:08:04| They have activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11284)|
| 3:08:06| They walk with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11286)|
| 3:08:07| They have exercising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11287)|
| 3:08:09| They look out for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11289)|
| 3:08:11| And my thing is that they need the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11291)|
| 3:08:14| We need the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11294)|
| 3:08:15| Because if we had the money, then we would have someone to stay with her at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11295)|
| 3:08:20| But this is a place to go to so that she can feel like a productive citizen of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11300)|
| 3:08:26| And ask yourself, you know, if not now, when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11306)|
| 3:08:29| When will someone in your family, a parent, a relative, a co-worker, someone on this panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11309)|
| 3:08:36| when will you be afflicted or have someone that's afflicted with Alzheimer's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11316)|
| 3:08:41| To know and to have a place like Howard Circle of Friends, and it is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11321)|
| 3:08:46| It is a circle of friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11326)|
| 3:08:48| The people that work there, the people that go there, they benefit from this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11328)|
| 3:08:53| And we're just blessed that Mount Calvary has given it to them so that they can have a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11333)|
| 3:08:58| in the East Knoxville community to go to and be cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11338)|
| 3:09:02| And I'm asking that you please continue to fund, and not just this year but every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11342)|
| 3:09:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11347)|
| 3:09:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11348)|
| 3:09:12| I'm just going to be real brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11352)|
| 3:09:14| Public speaking makes me nervous anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11354)|
| 3:09:16| But my grandmother is a participant in the Howard Circle of Friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11356)|
| 3:09:19| and she is one of the fortunate scholarship recipients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11359)|
| 3:09:22| My sister and I take care of my grandmother, but we work full time, both of us, with small children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11362)|
| 3:09:27| She currently takes about ten different medications, and having just Social Security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11367)|
| 3:09:32| most of the medication cost depletes that income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11372)|
| 3:09:35| And when the cost of a daycare program can be up to $70 a day, that is way out of our reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11375)|
| 3:09:42| But I thank God for the Howard Circle of Friends for stepping in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11382)|
| 3:09:45| and making it possible for us to take care of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11385)|
| 3:09:48| She actually thinks she works there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11388)|
| 3:09:51| And she tells me when she's not there that they need her to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11391)|
| 3:09:54| And I think to feel needed at this stage in her life is something that you can't put a price tag on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11394)|
| 3:09:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11399)|
| 3:10:00| I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11400)|
| 3:10:02| Amy Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11402)|
| 3:10:04| You want my address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11404)|
| 3:10:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11405)|
| 3:10:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11406)|
| 3:10:07| 521 Confederate Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11407)|
| 3:10:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11408)|
| 3:10:10| LaTanya?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11410)|
| 3:10:12| We would just ask for the county to consider our funding request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11412)|
| 3:10:18| And if you have any questions, I'll be happy to ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11418)|
| 3:10:23| Thank you, Janice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11423)|
| 3:10:25| Big brothers, big sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11425)|
| 3:10:29| Those are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11429)|
| 3:10:31| There are some of these I wouldn't give a nickel to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11431)|
| 3:10:43| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11443)|
| 3:10:44| My name is Myra Yateman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11444)|
| 3:10:46| I'm the CEO of Big Brothers, Big Sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11446)|
| 3:10:49| And I thank you for the opportunity to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11449)|
| 3:10:53| I appreciate that there is a second chance to talk about our program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11453)|
| 3:10:59| and hope that there will be funding available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11459)|
| 3:11:04| Big Brothers, Big Sisters has been in the Knoxville community for 38 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11464)|
| 3:11:09| Our mission for 38 years has been to provide caring mentors for children who need a positive role model in their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11469)|
| 3:11:18| We have two programs primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11478)|
| 3:11:22| One is community-based and one is school-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11482)|
| 3:11:25| And we are asking for funding from Knox County for our school-based program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11485)|
| 3:11:31| We are in a partnership with Project Grad to provide mentors for the children of the elementary schools in Project Grad's program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11491)|
| 3:11:41| And we've been doing that since 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11501)|
| 3:11:45| We began in 2004 with a fairly large grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11505)|
| 3:11:50| That grant ended in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11510)|
| 3:11:53| And we have kept the program together, kept the partnership together for this past year, serving nearly 300 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11513)|
| 3:12:02| We propose to serve 350 children in the Project Grad schools in the next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11522)|
| 3:12:10| And we are doing that through funding from a variety of foundations and our special fundraising events and through corporate support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11530)|
| 3:12:25| We have been working very hard to make certain that our programs are outcome-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11545)|
| 3:12:32| We know when we place a mentor in a relationship with a child, we measure the outcomes from that relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11552)|
| 3:12:42| And so we know that a mentor in the life of a child makes a difference in the life of that child and in the community ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11562)|
| 3:12:53| I have asked that some handouts be distributed to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11573)|
| 3:12:58| And I think that the faces of some of our matches, as you look at those faces and those friends, really tell our story better than we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11578)|
| 3:13:09| But also, the research that documents that children do better in school, they stay in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11589)|
| 3:13:18| and they become more productive citizens if they have a mentor in their life, is documented through some national research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11598)|
| 3:13:27| So I've provided you a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11607)|
| 3:13:30| We are now operating with a budget of just over $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11610)|
| 3:13:40| Knox County has supplied us with $10,000 a year for quite a few years for the Project GRED program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11620)|
| 3:13:49| And we are asking in this current budget cycle for $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11629)|
| 3:13:56| The panel liked us, recommended that we have $15,000, but unfortunately ran out of money before they got to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11636)|
| 3:14:06| So I'm hopeful that our plea for $15,000 to serve 350 children in the Project GRED school this next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11646)|
| 3:14:18| will somehow miraculously find a little spot, you'll find a little spot in your finance deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11658)|
| 3:14:27| I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11667)|
| 3:14:30| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11670)|
| 3:14:32| Ask for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11672)|
| 3:14:33| The 350 kids are waiting in the school-based match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11673)|
| 3:14:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11676)|
| 3:14:37| In the community-based match, how many kids are on the waiting list, and how long have they been waiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11677)|
| 3:14:41| We have 137 children currently on a waiting list for a big brother or a big sister in our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11681)|
| 3:14:51| And we are currently, this year, we will serve nearly 900 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11691)|
| 3:14:58| Eighty percent of those are in Knox County, and about 285 are in the school-based program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11698)|
| 3:15:08| The others are in the community-based program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11708)|
| 3:15:11| You know I'm a big and have been for about two and a half years a volunteer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11711)|
| 3:15:14| and I just hope that others take advantage and get some of those kids off the waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11714)|
| 3:15:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11718)|
| 3:15:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11719)|
| 3:15:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11721)|
| 3:15:22| North Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11722)|
| 3:15:30| North Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11730)|
| 3:15:37| UTV Power Training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11737)|
| 3:15:45| My name is Bob Kerr, and I'm with the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11745)|
| 3:15:48| We're at 2109 Terrace Avenue in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11748)|
| 3:15:53| And I've been in grants and contracts for over 30 years with UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11753)|
| 3:15:58| and the process that was used is a typical process in any submission of grants through an RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11758)|
| 3:16:09| We would love to get 100 percent funding like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11769)|
| 3:16:14| I think the recommendation was 61 percent funding on the V-Power training seminars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11774)|
| 3:16:20| and 43 percent funding on Learn to Earn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11780)|
| 3:16:25| I think the panel themselves, you know, they made applications to serve on the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11785)|
| 3:16:32| They volunteered their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11792)|
| 3:16:34| They did traditional things that needed to be done to recommend funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11794)|
| 3:16:40| It's my understanding they had over $5 million of RFPs that were submitted in proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11800)|
| 3:16:47| They had $2 million to allocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11807)|
| 3:16:51| So in my opinion, I think the panel did exactly what they were charged with doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11811)|
| 3:16:57| And, of course, like I said, we'd love to have 100 percent funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11817)|
| 3:17:01| Everybody would love to have 100 percent funding, but that's just not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11821)|
| 3:17:07| The V-Power seminars are designed to serve youth in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11827)|
| 3:17:12| The Learn to Earn is designed to serve people in the health care field that would like to advance in the health care field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11832)|
| 3:17:18| such as CNAs and technicians in the health care field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11838)|
| 3:17:26| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11846)|
| 3:17:28| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11848)|
| 3:17:30| Can you explain what the V-Power program is, what exactly it does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11850)|
| 3:17:34| V-Power is something that we designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11854)|
| 3:17:37| There's a high ropes course that people might be familiar with where you go out in the wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11857)|
| 3:17:43| and you do activities that teach team building, taking a risk, communications, listening skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11863)|
| 3:17:51| And we designed this that would be more of a classroom type activity where we can take it to the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11871)|
| 3:17:57| And we're hooking up with YMCAs and YWCAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11877)|
| 3:18:00| and we're going to do seminars with youth throughout the year that they serve throughout the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11880)|
| 3:18:06| and trying to teach them the same skills, the leadership skills, the team building, communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11886)|
| 3:18:12| taking a risk and making decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11892)|
| 3:18:16| So we have a whole set of activities that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11896)|
| 3:18:19| We have equipment that we take on site and trained facilitators that conduct the activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11899)|
| 3:18:27| And what is the Learn to Earn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11907)|
| 3:18:29| Learn to Earn is a program that we just started last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11909)|
| 3:18:34| It is one that we have a lot of CNAs in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11914)|
| 3:18:38| that go through certified nursing assistance training programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11918)|
| 3:18:43| And then when they get out into the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11923)|
| 3:18:45| they find out it's not really what they thought it would be when they go through the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11925)|
| 3:18:50| And they either drop out of the health care field because they can't move up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11930)|
| 3:18:55| And so we take them back in and offer them assistance to further their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11935)|
| 3:19:03| And also a lot of people are not able to go to school and work at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11943)|
| 3:19:08| And so we will help them with their utility bills, their car repairs, their tuition, their books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11948)|
| 3:19:15| and things like that so they can advance in the health care field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11955)|
| 3:19:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11961)|
| 3:19:24| Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11964)|
| 3:19:33| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11973)|
| 3:19:35| I'm Ginny Weatherstone with the Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11975)|
| 3:19:38| And I wanted very briefly to share with you something that has happened to me this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11978)|
| 3:19:44| because I think it's pretty interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11984)|
| 3:19:46| Some of you may know that we have a new building under construction at 511 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11986)|
| 3:19:52| It adjoins, it's adjacent to the Old Gray Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11992)|
| 3:19:56| I have noticed the last couple of weeks when I have gone over to that project site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=11996)|
| 3:20:01| that there's been a couple setting up a camp in the Old Gray Cemetery right next to our fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12001)|
| 3:20:07| And I've been concerned about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12007)|
| 3:20:09| Monday, I got a phone call from the superintendent of our construction project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12009)|
| 3:20:15| And he was very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12015)|
| 3:20:17| He said that the couple was involved in a very violent and loud fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12017)|
| 3:20:22| And, in fact, the man in this couple had picked up a large rock and was beating up the woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12022)|
| 3:20:29| And could I help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12029)|
| 3:20:31| As it happened, by the time I got there, the engineers from our project had jumped the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12031)|
| 3:20:38| and had broken up the fight and I understand delivered quite a talking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12038)|
| 3:20:43| to the gentleman in question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12043)|
| 3:20:45| This morning, I sat down with that couple and had a conversation with this woman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12045)|
| 3:20:50| to learn a little bit more about her situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12050)|
| 3:20:53| She is homeless, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12053)|
| 3:20:56| She has some physical problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12056)|
| 3:20:58| She has a disability check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12058)|
| 3:21:00| I was able to tell her that she could come to the volunteer ministry center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12060)|
| 3:21:04| and that we would help her get into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12064)|
| 3:21:08| That is the one thing that our homeless guests at the volunteer ministry center tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12068)|
| 3:21:14| that they want and need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12074)|
| 3:21:16| In her case, it is apparent that housing is what she needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12076)|
| 3:21:21| There are some challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12081)|
| 3:21:23| She has been evicted from KCDC before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12083)|
| 3:21:26| We can't just walk in and get her housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12086)|
| 3:21:29| She needs help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12089)|
| 3:21:31| And that help comes in the form of a case manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12091)|
| 3:21:35| an individual who is trained to deal with folks with her kind of problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12095)|
| 3:21:40| She is encouraged to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12100)|
| 3:21:42| She has the name of a case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12102)|
| 3:21:44| She knows when our next housing workshop is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12104)|
| 3:21:47| She also knows that the police department has been notified that that camp is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12107)|
| 3:21:53| and they will start doing walk-throughs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12113)|
| 3:21:55| and that it is our philosophy that it is not okay to camp outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12115)|
| 3:22:00| in a public place like that when there is assistance available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12120)|
| 3:22:04| That really is the VMC philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12124)|
| 3:22:08| Our goal and our only goal is to help every single homeless person get into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12128)|
| 3:22:16| All of the programs that the volunteer ministry center does focus on that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12136)|
| 3:22:23| What you are being asked to fund, as you have funded in years past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12143)|
| 3:22:27| is what we used to call the shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12147)|
| 3:22:30| We don't call it the shelter anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12150)|
| 3:22:33| We call it the day resource center because we're stepping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12153)|
| 3:22:37| It's no longer enough simply to provide a roof over someone's head during the daytime hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12157)|
| 3:22:42| simply to provide meals, clothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12162)|
| 3:22:45| More needs to be done to help folks get off the street and stay off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12165)|
| 3:22:51| And that's why the new work of the day resource center is to provide those resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12171)|
| 3:22:58| primarily in the form of people and the case managers to make those placements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12178)|
| 3:23:03| and then follow the newly housed homeless individual to make sure they are successful in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12183)|
| 3:23:09| Case managers also provide the classes and the other activities that attract people to VMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12189)|
| 3:23:16| so that they can get hooked into a better way of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12196)|
| 3:23:21| I am happy to share with you that last year the volunteer ministry center placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12201)|
| 3:23:26| and provided case management for 77 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12206)|
| 3:23:31| 77 people who were homeless as the year began and were not as the year ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12211)|
| 3:23:37| We're on track to repeat that or exceed it this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12217)|
| 3:23:42| It is critically important work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12222)|
| 3:23:45| In fact, it speaks to the very first strategy of the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12225)|
| 3:23:53| So the good news that I really share with you is that at the volunteer ministry center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12233)|
| 3:23:59| we believe homelessness is a problem which can be solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12239)|
| 3:24:04| We believe that we are beginning to do that one person at a time, one apartment at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12244)|
| 3:24:11| And we believe that we can do that because we partner with local government, with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12251)|
| 3:24:17| and we need to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12257)|
| 3:24:20| That is our mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12260)|
| 3:24:21| We are grateful for your assistance in reaching that mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12261)|
| 3:24:26| And I would be glad to respond to any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12266)|
| 3:24:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12273)|
| 3:24:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12274)|
| 3:24:35| Knoxville Opera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12275)|
| 3:24:40| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12280)|
| 3:24:41| I'm Mark Hill, and I'm president of the board of Knoxville Opera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12281)|
| 3:24:45| Our address is 612 East Depot, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12285)|
| 3:24:51| Wow, I've been sitting here for two hours listening to people who are concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12291)|
| 3:24:57| with really crucial human survival issues, and we're here to talk about opera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12297)|
| 3:25:04| And you've got to wonder, why is it important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12304)|
| 3:25:07| Why should commissions support something that might be considered as being somewhat frivolous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12307)|
| 3:25:12| And indeed, if you're in desperate need of health care, it probably is frivolous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12312)|
| 3:25:16| But just as I think that it's critical that we understand that a healthy and vibrant arts community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12316)|
| 3:25:24| in this city makes us a world-class city that can attract industry, that can attract the kinds of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12324)|
| 3:25:29| that can afford to fund, support, and volunteer on behalf of all these incredible service organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12329)|
| 3:25:38| that are in this city today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12338)|
| 3:25:40| So I'm actually here to talk about the Rossini Festival that we have been putting on for the last seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12340)|
| 3:25:48| Our general director, Brian Selesky, is currently attending the National Performing Arts Conference in Denver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12348)|
| 3:25:55| and that's something that was set up many, many months ago, so he was unable to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12355)|
| 3:25:59| So I'll be a very pale facsimile of Maestro Selesky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12359)|
| 3:26:06| I don't know how many of you attended, but on April 19th, we had between 35,000 and 40,000 people downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12366)|
| 3:26:12| to enjoy the seventh annual Rossini Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12372)|
| 3:26:15| We had 30 entertainment options, ranging from classical chamber music to belly dancers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12375)|
| 3:26:22| We had hundreds of local and regional artisans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12382)|
| 3:26:24| We had Italian cuisine from some of Knoxville's finest restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12384)|
| 3:26:29| And in addition to that, our little company, or your little company, with only five full-time employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12389)|
| 3:26:34| and with the help of hundreds of volunteers, did all this, plus stage two, sold out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12394)|
| 3:26:40| fully staged operas at the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12400)|
| 3:26:43| We've been doing this since downtown's renaissance was just in its very uncertain beginnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12403)|
| 3:26:49| During the last seven years, we've been responsible for bringing nearly 200,000 people downtown for this festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12409)|
| 3:26:55| many of whom might not have otherwise had a reason to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12415)|
| 3:26:58| We're proud that our efforts have been important in downtown's growth and comeback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12418)|
| 3:27:04| We're also proud that we've become the largest and most popular downtown festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12424)|
| 3:27:08| and that the Southeast Tourism Society considers Rossini Festival a top-20 event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12428)|
| 3:27:13| And we do all this free of charge to anybody who wants to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12433)|
| 3:27:18| It is absolutely free to anyone of any income level to enjoy this educational, recreational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12438)|
| 3:27:24| and very fun event that is truly unique to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12444)|
| 3:27:28| So the festival is both a blessing and a burden to our company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12448)|
| 3:27:33| It's raised community awareness of the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12453)|
| 3:27:36| It helps us obtain some grant money and the occasional corporate sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12456)|
| 3:27:40| But the bottom line is that it's a strain on an opera company to do something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12460)|
| 3:27:45| It takes away revenues from our core mission, which is to produce opera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12465)|
| 3:27:49| and it also inhibits our educational program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12469)|
| 3:27:52| So each year, our board of examiners, our board of directors examines this festival very carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12472)|
| 3:27:59| to decide whether we can do it yet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12479)|
| 3:28:01| We've had, up until this year, very little community support in terms of government support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12481)|
| 3:28:07| We've had, I believe, $10,000 in support from the county, which has been a general grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12487)|
| 3:28:12| not pertaining to the Rossini Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12492)|
| 3:28:15| But much to our relief, the grant process this year has provided us with some significant additional funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12495)|
| 3:28:22| which recognized the value of this unique festival and will make it much more possible for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12502)|
| 3:28:28| to continue to provide this gift to the city of Knoxville and to the general region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12508)|
| 3:28:36| So we ask that you maintain the level of funding that was recommended by the Citizens Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12516)|
| 3:28:42| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12522)|
| 3:28:46| What is your budget for that Rossini Festival?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12526)|
| 3:28:54| Our total budget is over $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12534)|
| 3:29:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12541)|
| 3:29:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12542)|
| 3:29:03| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12543)|
| 3:29:08| You put on the festival last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12548)|
| 3:29:10| My family and I have enjoyed it very much, and my mother, incidentally, was a trained opera singer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12550)|
| 3:29:14| so I always appreciate those very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12554)|
| 3:29:17| But we had the Rossini Festival and some of those others last year, and they were great festivals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12557)|
| 3:29:22| There's an additional, in addition to the $10,000 you got last year, this is $61,000 more this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12562)|
| 3:29:29| What different will you do with that money that you couldn't do last year, which was really a good program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12569)|
| 3:29:36| Well, first of all, that money was actually divided into two segments by the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12576)|
| 3:29:42| Part of that money, about $37,000 of it, is actually earmarked for our educational program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12582)|
| 3:29:48| which our Director of Development, Celeste Hart, is prepared to discuss with you, and I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12588)|
| 3:29:53| Well, what about the $34,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12593)|
| 3:29:56| The $34,000 will take some of the strain off of our operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12596)|
| 3:30:01| I can't tell you with certainty that you're going to see a very, very different festival this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12601)|
| 3:30:08| but you definitely will see a festival, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12608)|
| 3:30:12| This will enable us to, without question, present the festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12612)|
| 3:30:16| And number two, it will also enable us to put resources back into our performances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12616)|
| 3:30:21| which we have had to actually shortchange because of the cost of the festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12621)|
| 3:30:26| And I don't know if you're informed on that, but we've, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12626)|
| 3:30:29| we've had to cut back from three fully-stylized performances to two simply because our budget can't withstand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12629)|
| 3:30:37| We also had a number of years of operating in the red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12637)|
| 3:30:40| We're now operating in the black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12640)|
| 3:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12643)|
| 3:30:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12644)|
| 3:30:45| Girl Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12645)|
| 3:30:47| Oh, did you have another one for the opera, or you did both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12647)|
| 3:30:50| Yes, because we had applied for our education program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12650)|
| 3:30:54| The Rossini Festival is a totally different program that we do, so we should have had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12654)|
| 3:31:00| Well, I called for Knoxville Opera first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12660)|
| 3:31:03| And Mark came up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12663)|
| 3:31:06| Is it okay if I present on the education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12666)|
| 3:31:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12668)|
| 3:31:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12669)|
| 3:31:10| My name is Celeste Hart, and I'm the Director of Development with Knoxville Opera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12670)|
| 3:31:14| And first of all, I would like to thank all of the commissioners for your time and service to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12674)|
| 3:31:19| and we greatly appreciate your hard work and commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12679)|
| 3:31:23| I would also like to thank you for trying to implement a new process of awarding grants that would be more fair, open, and objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12683)|
| 3:31:31| Our organization feels this process led to more fairness on the evaluation made of Knoxville Opera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12691)|
| 3:31:36| and its contributions to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12696)|
| 3:31:39| We are also in favor of a well-educated citizens panel determining this crucial funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12699)|
| 3:31:44| and thank them very much for their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12704)|
| 3:31:47| And I'm here today to talk about our education program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12707)|
| 3:31:49| which is separate from the Italian Street Fair that we put on for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12709)|
| 3:31:54| And we applied for this funding as part of the cultural program, cultural grants program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12714)|
| 3:32:00| When we as grant makers first attended the workshop presented by the county community development staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12720)|
| 3:32:06| the key issue mentioned to us was that the reason the county gives us funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12726)|
| 3:32:10| is because it would cost the government substantially more money to try to do what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12730)|
| 3:32:15| and do it as well as we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12735)|
| 3:32:18| And that the value of what we provide to the community is very great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12738)|
| 3:32:22| Part of our mission includes being committed to enriching the lives of youth and adults in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12742)|
| 3:32:27| through our education program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12747)|
| 3:32:29| Students learn about vocal and instrumental music, literature, drama, theater, and history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12749)|
| 3:32:34| through opera and music theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12754)|
| 3:32:36| Outreach programs designed for adults are also an integral part of our mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12756)|
| 3:32:41| Last season this company with no full-time staff member in education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12761)|
| 3:32:46| presented 16 events for elementary, middle, and high school students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12766)|
| 3:32:50| reaching almost 4,300 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12770)|
| 3:32:53| We did 15 events for adults reaching over 1,300 adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12773)|
| 3:32:58| and 10 events for people of all ages reaching 2,900 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12778)|
| 3:33:03| That makes for a total of 41 events reaching over 8,500 students and adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12783)|
| 3:33:08| And that does not include the street fair that Mark just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12788)|
| 3:33:12| And the money we receive from the county makes this possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12792)|
| 3:33:15| and enhances the education that Knox County Schools are able to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12795)|
| 3:33:19| Our education program includes our in-school program, student dress rehearsals, and adult outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12799)|
| 3:33:27| The in-school program is called Opera 101| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12807)|
| 3:33:30| and it's an educational, interactive, and entertaining introduction to the world of music theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12810)|
| 3:33:35| It includes selections from musicals, great classics from opera, highlights from our productions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12815)|
| 3:33:41| and a question and answer session for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12821)|
| 3:33:44| And music teachers rave about the enthusiastic responses that they get from students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12824)|
| 3:33:49| Music teacher Melanie Carter from Grand Oaks Elementary said many, many thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12829)|
| 3:33:54| The opera was awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12834)|
| 3:33:56| The kids went around school all day singing opera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12836)|
| 3:33:59| And it was really neat to see the excitement of opera in kids who probably never experienced it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12839)|
| 3:34:04| Again, we reached 4,300 students last year with this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12844)|
| 3:34:08| And of course, this isn't just about opera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12848)|
| 3:34:11| It's about how the arts contribute to out-of-the-box thinking in students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12851)|
| 3:34:15| With the new and unusual problems that our society is facing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12855)|
| 3:34:19| creative problem solving is going to be crucial and we believe we encourage that in students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12859)|
| 3:34:24| Our fee for Opera 101 is nominal and covers our UT students who perform the program and traveling expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12864)|
| 3:34:32| Some schools are able to cover the fee, but others can only participate because of funding that comes from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12872)|
| 3:34:38| Another aspect of our education program is the student dress rehearsal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12878)|
| 3:34:43| Knoxville Opera offers middle and high school students the opportunity to experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12883)|
| 3:34:48| the magnificence of fully staged performances at a dress rehearsal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12888)|
| 3:34:51| And once again, students in need receive scholarships through funding provided by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12891)|
| 3:34:57| Opera is also available to adults through a series of entertaining and interactive seminars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12897)|
| 3:35:02| And some of the appearances we made last season included the Shannondale Retirement Community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12902)|
| 3:35:07| the Sertoma Center, the Wellness Community, and the Ola Hispanic Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12907)|
| 3:35:12| So hopefully that gives you a brief idea of our education program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12912)|
| 3:35:16| We hope that the commissioner's vote to keep the awards intact so Knoxville Opera can continue to have a strong impact on education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12916)|
| 3:35:23| in Knox County schools to give thousands of children and students the best our community has to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12923)|
| 3:35:29| Thank you again for allowing us to present today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12929)|
| 3:35:32| Thank you. Now Girl Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12932)|
| 3:35:44| Good morning. Well, it's afternoon almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12944)|
| 3:35:47| We thank you very much for the opportunity to be here and present our program request to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12947)|
| 3:35:52| And I also want to take a second to tell you how much we appreciate the process that the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12952)|
| 3:35:57| that volunteer committee put together for this grants process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12957)|
| 3:36:01| I'd like to introduce Jennifer Glab, who is our training manager and who will speak to you on the request for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12961)|
| 3:36:07| And we need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12967)|
| 3:36:09| Oh, I'm sorry. Lucille Griffo. I'm the CEO for the Girl Scouts of Tenassee Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12969)|
| 3:36:13| 1600 Breeda Drive, zip code 3718.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12973)|
| 3:36:19| Thank you. Our Girl Scout program is built on the words to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12979)|
| 3:36:25| That phase is at the heart of our 96 year old Girl Scout promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12985)|
| 3:36:29| Each Girl Scout pledges to serve God and my country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12989)|
| 3:36:33| In Knox County alone, Girl Scouts are living up to that pledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12993)|
| 3:36:37| dedicating more than 7000 hours of community service to local groups and organizations every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=12997)|
| 3:36:44| Our trained volunteers are inspiration and invaluable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13004)|
| 3:36:48| Quite simply, there would be no Girl Scouting without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13008)|
| 3:36:52| Our leaders are dedicated to our girls, teaching them skills for success in the real world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13012)|
| 3:36:57| that build young women into tomorrow's leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13017)|
| 3:37:00| In Girl Scouting, girls learn the importance of personal responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13020)|
| 3:37:05| the value of goal setting, the spirit of teamwork, and the reward of making a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13025)|
| 3:37:11| We train our volunteers to provide this kind of program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13031)|
| 3:37:14| So we are asking for $15,152 of our $36,950 training program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13034)|
| 3:37:23| budget, excuse me, to help train our volunteers that serve nearly 5000 Girl Scouts in Knox County alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13043)|
| 3:37:31| And I'm happy to pronounce that we have increased membership 19% this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13051)|
| 3:37:37| Just as Knox County teachers must learn how to best teach children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13057)|
| 3:37:41| Girl Scout leaders must learn how to best mentor girls on their journey into adulthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13061)|
| 3:37:46| Our training prepares adults to deliver quality Girl Scout program in a safe and nurturing environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13066)|
| 3:37:52| Our training methods give Girl Scout leaders the skills to mentor girls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13072)|
| 3:37:56| from the beginning of Girl Scouting through graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13076)|
| 3:38:00| Leaders are also trained to provide Girl Scouting experience to girls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13080)|
| 3:38:04| Leaders are also trained to provide Girl Scouting experience to every girl who wants to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13084)|
| 3:38:10| We provide this training predominantly for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13090)|
| 3:38:13| We are a non-profit and we have expenses we must meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13093)|
| 3:38:17| while still delivering the high quality program that Girl Scouts Tenacity Council has provided for nearly a century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13097)|
| 3:38:24| As technology becomes a part of people's lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13104)|
| 3:38:27| we are developing 21st century services like integrated learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13107)|
| 3:38:31| training online, CD-ROM and self-guided studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13111)|
| 3:38:35| and other programs to supplement our quality instructor-led courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13115)|
| 3:38:40| With these new e-learning initiatives, we will reach more adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13120)|
| 3:38:44| and offer further training more conveniently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13124)|
| 3:38:47| As the program grows, we know we will continue to supplement training beyond basic leadership courses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13127)|
| 3:38:54| to help our leaders grow through continuing education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13134)|
| 3:38:57| These courses will help them stay current and provide exceptional program to our girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13137)|
| 3:39:02| Girl Scout leaders build girls of courage, confidence and character who make the world a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13142)|
| 3:39:09| Our girls in turn build stronger communities not only as they grow in Girl Scouting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13149)|
| 3:39:14| but as they grow into leaders in their neighborhoods, their cities, their regions and their worlds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13154)|
| 3:39:20| We look forward to partnering with you in helping girls in our community grow strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13160)|
| 3:39:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13164)|
| 3:39:26| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13166)|
| 3:39:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13168)|
| 3:39:29| We'll break until 1 o'clock for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=13169)|
