| 2:38:00| and we've got another one or two that's their second meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9480)|
| 2:38:02| I think it's important that they hear from our counsel as to what should guide us when we make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9482)|
| 2:38:08| So I'm going to ask our legal counsel a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9488)|
| 2:38:12| What should we consider and what alone could we not consider when I hear things like burden to the community, not in harmony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9492)|
| 2:38:23| Would you please speak to that and guide us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9503)|
| 2:38:30| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| That's a broad question, so I'm going to try to do my best to give some overarching concepts that commissioners should consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9514)|
| 2:38:43| in the context of this subdivision concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9523)|
| 2:38:49| So, as you all know, some of you, again, as you mentioned, are new to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9529)|
| 2:38:56| Some of you have done it for a long time, but nonetheless, as commissioners, you have a great deal of discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9536)|
| 2:39:03| as you exercise the authority that is given to you as commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9543)|
| 2:39:08| That is true whether you've sat on this as a commissioner for a long time or if this is your first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9548)|
| 2:39:14| You are authorized as a body to vote and use your discretion, and you should act within that authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9554)|
| 2:39:21| because that's what local communities are supposed to do as they set planning priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9561)|
| 2:39:27| But also keep in mind that as you consider plans like this one, you are acting in an administrative or a quasi-judicial function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9567)|
| 2:39:38| So that means that the exercise of that discretion is not without its limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9578)|
| 2:39:43| You are bound to exercise discretion within existing standards and guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9583)|
| 2:39:50| You are bound to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| Otherwise, you run the risk that a reviewing body, whether that's a city council or a county commission or a court later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9592)|
| 2:40:01| could determine that you acted outside of your discretion and outside of your authority in an arbitrary fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9601)|
| 2:40:07| So your discretion must be guided by rules or guidelines, plans, zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9607)|
| 2:40:16| things that are established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9616)|
| 2:40:19| So that's the first thing that I think is important for everyone to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9619)|
| 2:40:23| You must look to the applicable laws, ordinances, resolutions, policies, rules, zoning code, sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9623)|
| 2:40:32| growth policy plan, and the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9632)|
| 2:40:36| Tennessee law, Tennessee statutes grant planning commissions like this one to the authority to adopt regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9636)|
| 2:40:43| to provide for harmonious development within the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9643)|
| 2:40:48| So that concept of harmonious development is embodied in the regulations themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9648)|
| 2:40:56| That is how they are to be drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9656)|
| 2:40:58| You are not asked as commissioners and as a body to evaluate on the whole each and every concept or plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9658)|
| 2:41:06| or application that comes before you to determine if each one separately is in fact harmonious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9666)|
| 2:41:13| However, you need to look to the concept that these plans have been passed with the idea that harmonious development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9673)|
| 2:41:20| is a part of those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9680)|
| 2:41:24| Harmonious development has been incorporated into the way that those regulations have been drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9684)|
| 2:41:32| So you are asked to make sure as we implement those regulations that we do so in a way that will ensure harmony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9692)|
| 2:41:41| That is embodied in Tennessee law and it's embodied in our subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9701)|
| 2:41:45| In fact, if you look at the very concept, you look at the subdivision regulations that apply to Knox planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9705)|
| 2:41:51| it says in section 1.01 these subdivision regulations are adopted in order to provide for the harmonious development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9711)|
| 2:42:00| of the city of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9720)|
| 2:42:03| So that is in fact something that is included by design, by intention in the plans themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9723)|
| 2:42:12| So you should look within your discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9732)|
| 2:42:18| You need to look and make sure that the regulations have been satisfied on the face of those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9738)|
| 2:42:25| This is also a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9745)|
| 2:42:28| Again, I mentioned that's administrative or quasi-judicial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9748)|
| 2:42:31| So you have to administer and you have to exercise your discretion within those existing rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9751)|
| 2:42:37| I want to point out a couple of, I'm going to turn your attention now specifically to the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9757)|
| 2:42:48| because I think it's important to look at what your options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| Again, I turn to those not because that's the only source of authority for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9771)|
| 2:42:55| As I mentioned, you should be looking at zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9775)|
| 2:42:58| You should be looking at plans, but you should also look at the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9778)|
| 2:43:14| Under section 2.07, a concept plan has a purpose under our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9794)|
| 2:43:19| The purpose is that the concept plan is the first official plan required by the regulations for a major subdivision of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9799)|
| 2:43:28| The purpose of the plan is to provide the planning commissioners and the planning staff with sufficient information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9808)|
| 2:43:35| to determine the practicality, suitability, and conformance with regulations of the proposed concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9815)|
| 2:43:43| So as you consider this plan, I would suggest to you that you should be guided by 2.07A in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9823)|
| 2:43:53| because you are looking to determine practicality, suitability, and conformance with regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9833)|
| 2:44:01| I also would turn your attention to section 1.05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9841)|
| 2:44:12| That section indicates that these land subdivision regulations are adopted as minimum requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9852)|
| 2:44:19| and all developers are asked, as they develop their subdivisions, to consider higher standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9859)|
| 2:44:26| And the developers are encouraged to go beyond the standards, beyond those that are the minimum requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9866)|
| 2:44:32| The planning commission, as you look to exercise your discretion in making this vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9872)|
| 2:44:38| can also require standards above the minimum so long as you make a finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9878)|
| 2:44:44| that the public health, safety, and welfare justify that type of exercise of your discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9884)|
| 2:44:51| So again, my advice as counsel is that as you look at this concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9891)|
| 2:44:56| if you decide, as you cast your vote, as you determine how you intend to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9896)|
| 2:45:01| you must keep in mind applicable rules and guidelines and also public health, safety, and welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9901)|
| 2:45:08| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9908)|
| 2:45:10| That's an outstanding educational workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9910)|
| 2:45:13| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9913)|
| 2:45:15| I'm going to turn off my mic now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| It was much needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9917)|
| 2:45:18| And the point of me saying I was fourth most senior, I've only been here less than two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9918)|
| 2:45:22| so we've got a new group and I think we all needed to hear that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9922)|
| 2:45:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9926)|
| 2:45:27| Let me add one other thing, too, and then I really will stop talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9927)|
| 2:45:30| unless you ask me to talk again, and I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| Let me look and ask you all to look at section 2.07 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9933)|
| 2:45:38| It's 2.07E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| Let's talk about what, commissioners, what your options are at this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9940)|
| 2:45:44| Because, again, we need to remember what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9944)|
| 2:45:46| This is a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| So let's look at section 2.07E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9948)|
| 2:45:54| My computer is scrolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9954)|
| 2:45:55| Give me a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9955)|
| 2:46:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| So section 2.07 specifically has to do with concept plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9964)|
| 2:46:17| It talks about the obligations of the developer or the applicant to submit the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9977)|
| 2:46:21| It talks about the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9981)|
| 2:46:23| Obviously that's where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| And it talks about what the options are of the planning commission at this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9985)|
| 2:46:29| So 2.07E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| Following the public hearing, the planning commission will consider all recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9991)|
| 2:46:35| and approve, approve subject to conditions, disapprove, or upon request of the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9995)|
| 2:46:42| either in writing or at the hearing, postpone action or permit withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10002)|
| 2:46:47| So as I view it, those appear to be your options as you cast your vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10007)|
| 2:46:54| Can you read this one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10014)|
| 2:46:55| Happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10015)|
| 2:46:56| Happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10016)|
| 2:46:57| No, no, not the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10019)|
| 2:47:00| You're looking at 2.07E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10020)|
| 2:47:12| Which is subtitled as planning commission action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10032)|
| 2:47:16| Following the public hearing, the planning commission will consider all recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10036)|
| 2:47:21| and approve, approve subject to conditions, disapprove, or upon request of the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10041)|
| 2:47:29| either in writing or at the hearing, postpone action or permit withdrawal of the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10049)|
| 2:47:43| Any further questions for Ms. Blakeney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10063)|
| 2:47:49| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10071)|
| 2:47:52| I guess my question probably falls in line with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10072)|
| 2:47:56| I was going to ask about the East Knox County Communities Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10076)|
| 2:48:01| Is that something that's been, I guess, codified by commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10081)|
| 2:48:06| Or how was this plan developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10086)|
| 2:48:10| That is probably a better question for staff than for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10090)|
| 2:48:12| I'll ask Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10092)|
| 2:48:15| The East County Community Plan was adopted by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10095)|
| 2:48:19| So in effect, it's adopted into the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10099)|
| 2:48:24| In terms of how it was, it was a community plan that was directed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10104)|
| 2:48:29| planning staff were directed to develop it after a decision was made on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10109)|
| 2:48:38| I apologize, I'm blanking on the name of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10118)|
| 2:48:44| it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10124)|
| 2:48:45| The Midway Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10125)|
| 2:48:46| The Midway Project, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10126)|
| 2:48:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10127)|
| 2:48:49| So this was back in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| So we undertook a pretty large community process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10131)|
| 2:48:54| We hired a consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10134)|
| 2:48:55| It was developed in conjunction with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10135)|
| 2:48:58| It was taken to this body and then taken on to county commission for final adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10138)|
| 2:49:03| Is that answering all your questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10143)|
| 2:49:08| Yeah, so does the staff consider the East Knox County Communities Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10148)|
| 2:49:13| when they reviewed this subdivision concept plan for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10153)|
| 2:49:17| Yes, we considered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10157)|
| 2:49:19| And it's one of the reasons I mentioned it during the agenda review the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| is the highlighting of one of the adopted plans to take into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10162)|
| 2:49:29| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10169)|
| 2:49:31| And this is a question that I'm not for sure who's going to have to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10171)|
| 2:49:35| So I'm directing it to legal, but it may have to go to one of the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10175)|
| 2:49:39| My understanding is that this went through rezoning about 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10179)|
| 2:49:43| So it went from agricultural to residential agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10183)|
| 2:49:47| But yet we've seen staff recommendation on other rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10187)|
| 2:49:51| where they were recommended as denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10191)|
| 2:49:54| because it was not consistent with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10194)|
| 2:49:57| So if we rewind 13 years, I guess was the intent for the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10197)|
| 2:50:05| that the neighborhood might not have known about for this many homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10205)|
| 2:50:09| or was the rezoning at that time not for five units that could be put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10209)|
| 2:50:14| or whatever this is right now on that residential, that RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10214)|
| 2:50:21| It was redone a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| Yeah, it was actually rezoned in 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10225)|
| 2:50:27| And at the time it was, there wasn't a sector plan, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10227)|
| 2:50:32| At the time it was the, there was a small area plan for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10232)|
| 2:50:36| I can't remember what the name of the small area plan was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10236)|
| 2:50:38| But in the staff report for that rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10238)|
| 2:50:41| it recommended approval of the rezoning because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10241)|
| 2:50:45| like I said, it wasn't an east sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10245)|
| 2:50:49| It noted that development of urban areas should be coordinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10249)|
| 2:50:53| with the expansion of services, utilities, and the community facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10253)|
| 2:50:58| And before that it noted that utilities were planned to be extended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10258)|
| 2:51:02| to this area in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10262)|
| 2:51:04| So at the time it was being, it was consistent with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10264)|
| 2:51:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10272)|
| 2:51:13| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10273)|
| 2:51:17| You know, if this was a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10277)|
| 2:51:21| if this was an agriculturally zoned piece of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10281)|
| 2:51:24| that an applicant was trying to rezone to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10284)|
| 2:51:27| and all these people are here, I think it gets denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10287)|
| 2:51:31| You know, there's no question, easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| The tough thing about this one is it complies with the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10293)|
| 2:51:37| sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10297)|
| 2:51:39| It's already zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| And what they're proposing, I don't see how that whole area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10301)|
| 2:51:47| is zoned to LDR and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10307)|
| 2:51:49| So not only, I mean, there could be other ones that come along also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10309)|
| 2:51:55| And so to the people that are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10315)|
| 2:51:58| I tell you that we as commissioners, this is a hard one for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10318)|
| 2:52:01| because we know you're upset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10321)|
| 2:52:03| but this property's been zoned for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10323)|
| 2:52:05| And I don't know, as a property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10325)|
| 2:52:08| how we deny somebody the use of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10328)|
| 2:52:12| when that use complies with zoning they've had for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10332)|
| 2:52:15| It's not really a stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10335)|
| 2:52:17| It's a big property is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10337)|
| 2:52:20| And so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10340)|
| 2:52:22| I don't know how you deny somebody a use that conforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10342)|
| 2:52:26| to the zoning sector plan and growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10346)|
| 2:52:29| That's my problem right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10349)|
| 2:52:33| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10353)|
| 2:52:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10358)|
| 2:52:40| We've been talking about guidelines and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10360)|
| 2:52:43| And it was brought up that they needed the 400 or however many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10363)|
| 2:52:53| 482 lots or the project wouldn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10373)|
| 2:52:59| One of our guidelines is that we don't set barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10379)|
| 2:53:07| in front of developers to keep them from developing a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10387)|
| 2:53:15| But we also don't even consider the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10395)|
| 2:53:20| that it's going to be profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10400)|
| 2:53:22| That's their problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10402)|
| 2:53:24| It's not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10404)|
| 2:53:27| If he can't make it on less than 482,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10407)|
| 2:53:31| he's got to think of something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10411)|
| 2:53:36| And likewise, we shouldn't put burdens on the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10416)|
| 2:53:41| that make it so that he can't do it with 482.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10421)|
| 2:53:49| It's just something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10429)|
| 2:53:55| It shouldn't apply is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10435)|
| 2:53:58| Whether it's profitable or not, it's his problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10438)|
| 2:54:04| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10444)|
| 2:54:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10447)|
| 2:54:10| And I really appreciate the conversation that's being had about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10450)|
| 2:54:14| and the clarifications about what we can and can't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10454)|
| 2:54:18| and what we should be thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10458)|
| 2:54:20| And I also want to say I really appreciate the opposition's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10460)|
| 2:54:25| just step-by-step what the issues are that they are concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10465)|
| 2:54:32| One of the things that came up during our agenda review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10472)|
| 2:54:35| was about the sizes and that most of the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10475)|
| 2:54:41| regardless of where they might have gone after their initial statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10481)|
| 2:54:44| started with, this is huge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| besides the development was the real kind of trigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10486)|
| 2:54:50| And I appreciate Commissioner Smith saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10490)|
| 2:54:53| if this was coming in smaller in phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10493)|
| 2:54:57| probably we'd all be much more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10497)|
| 2:55:00| And I'm just curious about in the four or five options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10500)|
| 2:55:06| that we have as a planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10506)|
| 2:55:09| what we can ask in terms of seeing phases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10509)|
| 2:55:13| and the question about amenities that are being promised in the concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10513)|
| 2:55:22| when those would actually come to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10522)|
| 2:55:25| if that is something that we can learn today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| or if that can be asked of the applicant fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10527)|
| 2:55:38| I think that you can certainly ask the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| to speak to those issues, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10540)|
| 2:55:44| Okay. Hi. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10544)|
| 2:55:47| With the sidewalks, there is a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10547)|
| 2:55:50| from Knox County Engineering that we'll work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10550)|
| 2:55:53| The next phase of this would be a design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| We'll get with Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| I think they have something that if the trips hit a certain level on a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10557)|
| 2:56:02| that they require sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10562)|
| 2:56:03| So we'll work with Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10563)|
| 2:56:05| and probably put them on a few of the main roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10565)|
| 2:56:08| We won't go out every single cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10568)|
| 2:56:10| but the main roads would probably be required by Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10570)|
| 2:56:13| once we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| For our amenity package, we've got quite a few in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10575)|
| 2:56:18| One of the main amenity packages is a huge clubhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| We'll put in a fitness center pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10581)|
| 2:56:25| and it'll be a sort of large clubhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10585)|
| 2:56:27| We sort of modeled it sort of like a large apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| or something like that that they would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10590)|
| 2:56:32| That seems to be what the people would want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10592)|
| 2:56:36| We have pocket parks, a couple more pocket parks throughout the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10596)|
| 2:56:40| One for a dog park is what it's earmarked for in one section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10600)|
| 2:56:44| Another one is another area that we probably thought about doing a playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10604)|
| 2:56:48| or something that looks like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| Also, the biggest thing that we did is what Blaine alluded to earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10610)|
| 2:56:56| is one lot there of about 1.5, 1.6 acres that we gave up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10616)|
| 2:57:00| which would give access down to the river right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10620)|
| 2:57:03| So there will be actual access to the river for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10623)|
| 2:57:07| There's talk about turning that over to Knox County Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10627)|
| 2:57:11| I understand right now that they can't accept it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| but if Knox County wanted to come in and to develop that into a park community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10634)|
| 2:57:18| absolutely, that would work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| But Knox County, of course, obviously won't commit to that area right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10640)|
| 2:57:23| But we'll at least dedicate the land for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10643)|
| 2:57:27| and let them use that for a community area right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10647)|
| 2:57:32| Mr. Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10652)|
| 2:57:33| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10653)|
| 2:57:34| You said you're talking about the sidewalk plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10654)|
| 2:57:36| and we have seen two different sidewalk plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10656)|
| 2:57:40| There was one that was provided yesterday, I think, by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10660)|
| 2:57:45| And is that the one that you're speaking of that you're committing to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10665)|
| 2:57:50| Did we see a sidewalk plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10670)|
| 2:57:51| Public Works sent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10673)|
| 2:57:54| I have not seen that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10674)|
| 2:57:55| It would have come in this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10675)|
| 2:57:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10676)|
| 2:57:57| It was sent to you this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10677)|
| 2:57:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10678)|
| 2:57:59| It was provided by Knox County Public Works that they identified which streets that they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10679)|
| 2:58:03| based on the plan that they had before them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10683)|
| 2:58:05| that they would be looking to add sidewalks to or request sidewalks be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10685)|
| 2:58:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10689)|
| 2:58:10| I have not seen that plan that you talked about yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10690)|
| 2:58:11| So that was thought of before coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| We would incorporate that into our design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10693)|
| 2:58:16| But that's not commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10696)|
| 2:58:19| They have not had a conversation with the applicant at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10699)|
| 2:58:23| We provided that at the request of the commission on Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10703)|
| 2:58:26| to identify which ones might be considered based on the plan they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10706)|
| 2:58:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10710)|
| 2:58:31| And then the second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10711)|
| 2:58:33| I appreciate you going into greater detail about what some of those amenities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10713)|
| 2:58:36| and kind of bringing them to life a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10716)|
| 2:58:38| Can you speak to the timing of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10718)|
| 2:58:40| Is that something that is happening, you know, Phase 1, the first group of houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10720)|
| 2:58:46| or is that something like 10 years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10726)|
| 2:58:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10728)|
| 2:58:49| I'm sure Phase 1 will include the main community center there as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10729)|
| 2:58:54| because that's where Blaine will want to take everybody in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10734)|
| 2:58:57| and sit down to sell the lots and sell the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| So that would be on the front end, I'm sure, that we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10739)|
| 2:59:03| Now, the other pocket parks would come as we develop through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10743)|
| 2:59:06| and I'm not totally sure of the entire phasing of this project yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10746)|
| 2:59:10| We'll work with that with the county engineering and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10750)|
| 2:59:14| Once we get to those areas, of course, we'll dedicate the parks at those times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10754)|
| 2:59:18| Is there some type of phased plan that we can see ever before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10758)|
| 2:59:25| Obviously, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| That's something that, you know, we'll sit down with Blaine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10767)|
| 2:59:30| and look at the natural board breaks, where the sewer would naturally break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10770)|
| 2:59:36| and it would be easier to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| So there's a lot to consider when you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10778)|
| 2:59:40| I would say, probably like Blaine said, about 25 acres probably is what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10780)|
| 2:59:45| So that's probably about 50 lots per phase in that neighborhood right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10785)|
| 2:59:49| is what we'll be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10792)|
| 2:59:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10793)|
| 2:59:55| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10795)|
| 2:59:58| I just need a little education here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10798)|
| 3:00:02| There has been a comment made, maybe it was the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10802)|
| 3:00:05| maybe I've read it in an email, there's been so much communication on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10805)|
| 3:00:09| If we approve a concept plan, is it only good for five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10809)|
| 3:00:13| And if so, if we're acting in a judicial role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10813)|
| 3:00:16| how can we approve a concept plan that would extend beyond that five years into a 10-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10816)|
| 3:00:20| and it be valid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10820)|
| 3:00:25| There is a time lapse for a concept plan found in the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10825)|
| 3:00:31| And again, we're looking at 2.07F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10831)|
| 3:00:42| So 2.07 is, again, concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10842)|
| 3:00:46| That is the category there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10846)|
| 3:00:49| If you look at 2.7F, time lapse for concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10849)|
| 3:00:54| unless a time extension has been requested by the developer and granted by the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10854)|
| 3:00:59| a final plat for the first unit shall be submitted within 36 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10859)|
| 3:01:04| of the approval date of the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10864)|
| 3:01:07| That's the standard requirement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10867)|
| 3:01:10| And keep in mind, too, another provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10870)|
| 3:01:15| I think that it's important for the commissioners to be aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10875)|
| 3:01:19| under that planning commission action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10879)|
| 3:01:21| We talked about that earlier, about after the hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10881)|
| 3:01:26| you either approve, approve subject to conditions, disapprove, or postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10886)|
| 3:01:33| Under that heading, Subset 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10893)|
| 3:01:36| approval of the concept plan by the planning commission is conditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10896)|
| 3:01:41| on certification of engineering documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10901)|
| 3:01:44| that the proposed development meets the development standards of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10904)|
| 3:01:48| or the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10908)|
| 3:01:50| and of the authorities having development review responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10910)|
| 3:01:53| and all applicable regulations in effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10913)|
| 3:01:56| at the time of the certification of the design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10916)|
| 3:02:00| Okay, so in all that, I just want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10920)|
| 3:02:05| As long as they, within 36 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10925)|
| 3:02:09| plat the first piece of property, they're good for all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10929)|
| 3:02:14| even if it takes 10 years, if the concept plan is only good for five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10934)|
| 3:02:21| Let me refer you to the entirety of that language on subdivision F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10941)|
| 3:02:29| So unless a time extension has been granted by the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10949)|
| 3:02:33| the final plat of the first unit shall be submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10953)|
| 3:02:37| within 36 months of the approval date of the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10957)|
| 3:02:41| Otherwise, the plat cannot receive final plat consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10961)|
| 3:02:44| but shall be considered as and resubmitted as a new concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10964)|
| 3:02:50| Final plat approval of each unit of the subdivision will extend the valid period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10970)|
| 3:02:54| of the concept plan 24 months from the final plat approval date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10974)|
| 3:02:59| by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10979)|
| 3:03:01| However, and I think this is probably the part, Commissioner Schmitz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10981)|
| 3:03:04| that you were thinking about, no concept plan shall be in effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10984)|
| 3:03:07| after five years from the original approval date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10987)|
| 3:03:10| and is subject to a new approval of the concept plan by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10990)|
| 3:03:16| I will also add that state law comes into play as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10996)|
| 3:03:19| So vesting rights, and we probably need to add just a little clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=10999)|
| 3:03:27| The total vesting period cannot exceed 10 years after construction starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11007)|
| 3:03:30| unless a local government approves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11010)|
| 3:03:33| And then in no case, the total vesting period cannot exceed 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11013)|
| 3:03:37| after construction starts without a local government approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11017)|
| 3:03:40| So once you get to that time frame, it would have to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11020)|
| 3:03:42| if it wasn't complete, they wanted to extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11022)|
| 3:03:45| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11025)|
| 3:03:53| Chair recognizes Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11033)|
| 3:03:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11037)|
| 3:03:58| I have two questions for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| The first question, I think the applicant mentioned a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11040)|
| 3:04:04| of five dwelling units per acre for this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11044)|
| 3:04:08| Is that the maximum density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11048)|
| 3:04:11| I know that that's not what it's built out to on the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11051)|
| 3:04:14| but what's the maximum that this could be built out at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11054)|
| 3:04:18| So five dwelling units per acre, probably referring to the land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11058)|
| 3:04:24| the low density residential land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11064)|
| 3:04:26| so that's the maximum that's permissible under that land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11066)|
| 3:04:29| The RA zoning for single family houses requires a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11069)|
| 3:04:33| of 10,000 square foot lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11073)|
| 3:04:35| You're going to end up with less than five dwelling units per acre right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11075)|
| 3:04:39| and that does not include roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| and other types of infrastructure that you're putting in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11081)|
| 3:04:43| so you're going to end up with a lower density total in the RA zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11083)|
| 3:04:46| than even four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11086)|
| 3:04:49| They're at, I think it was 2.6 or something around there, 2.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11089)|
| 3:04:58| Okay, and then my second question is sort of a general one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11098)|
| 3:05:03| You were mentioning our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11103)|
| 3:05:07| So our options would not necessarily include altering the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11107)|
| 3:05:12| that this is built out at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11112)|
| 3:05:14| I just want to ask that generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11114)|
| 3:05:18| That is a tough question, and there's not a real clear answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11118)|
| 3:05:24| There is case law out there that talks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11124)|
| 3:05:27| but doesn't analyze very specifically the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11127)|
| 3:05:30| that have sometimes been imposed on concept plans like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11130)|
| 3:05:34| but I do think that you've got to keep in mind, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11134)|
| 3:05:39| the applicable guidelines and rules and regulations that are in effect here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11139)|
| 3:05:43| and whether those are being complied with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11143)|
| 3:05:47| I think that's the important thing to review as you consider your discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11147)|
| 3:05:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11153)|
| 3:05:56| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11156)|
| 3:06:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11160)|
| 3:06:04| I agree with Commissioner Scott-Smith's assessment of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11164)|
| 3:06:11| that it's very hard to look at what's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11171)|
| 3:06:21| It already has RA zoning, and you were asking about the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11181)|
| 3:06:27| I think that works out to about three-and-a-half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11187)|
| 3:06:31| to three-and-three-quarters an acre, depending on how it's laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11191)|
| 3:06:43| It has the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11203)|
| 3:06:45| It's within the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11205)|
| 3:06:50| Any time that you see two or two-and-a-half units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11210)|
| 3:06:57| I've been out and looked, and you all have beautiful homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11217)|
| 3:07:02| and they're estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11222)|
| 3:07:04| They're not just homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11224)|
| 3:07:06| They're estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| But people have rights, land-use rights, to use their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11228)|
| 3:07:17| and that's what we're looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11237)|
| 3:07:21| So I'm going to go ahead and make a motion, see where it goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11241)|
| 3:07:27| that we approve staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11247)|
| 3:07:31| and approve variances one through four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11251)|
| 3:07:34| and alternative design standards one through seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11254)|
| 3:07:37| on the recommendations of the Knox County Department of Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11257)|
| 3:07:41| and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11261)|
| 3:07:43| because the site conditions restrict compliance with subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11263)|
| 3:07:48| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11268)|
| 3:07:54| Commissioner Graham, I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11274)|
| 3:07:57| I had to amend the alternative design standards before the meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11277)|
| 3:08:03| I realized I missed one of their requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11283)|
| 3:08:05| so there's actually eight alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| One through eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11287)|
| 3:08:10| One through eight, Commissioner, on the alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11290)|
| 3:08:13| I had to add one to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11293)|
| 3:08:22| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11302)|
| 3:08:26| The last guy in the room who wants to second this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11306)|
| 3:08:28| is a guy that was raised in District 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11308)|
| 3:08:30| but for all the reasons that Commissioner Graff spelled out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11310)|
| 3:08:34| I wanted to see smaller development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11314)|
| 3:08:37| That's what I want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11317)|
| 3:08:39| But, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11319)|
| 3:08:44| That'll last for about that long when I finish my sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11324)|
| 3:08:47| because that's what I desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11327)|
| 3:08:50| but I don't feel like I have the authority for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11330)|
| 3:08:53| and for those reasons, I'm legally bound, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11333)|
| 3:08:56| based on what our legal counsel explained to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11336)|
| 3:08:59| and I think it warrants a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11339)|
| 3:09:04| Yeah, we've got additional comments before we go to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11344)|
| 3:09:08| Chair recognizes Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11348)|
| 3:09:13| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11353)|
| 3:09:16| I'm going to bumble around with my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11356)|
| 3:09:18| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11358)|
| 3:09:21| One of the things I have concerns about is that we've all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11361)|
| 3:09:29| during a gender review, kind of trying to figure out how do we handle this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11369)|
| 3:09:35| meeting all of these particular requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11375)|
| 3:09:38| yet there's some discomfort with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11378)|
| 3:09:40| and it seems to be around the size of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11380)|
| 3:09:47| At the same time, I see comment that I think it was in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11387)|
| 3:09:53| I can't remember what it was in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11393)|
| 3:09:55| but it talks about this being a setting of a precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11395)|
| 3:10:00| like this is one of the largest developments that we've looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11400)|
| 3:10:03| and so I feel like we're kind of getting into this different territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11403)|
| 3:10:07| It's so large that that's why we're uncomfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11407)|
| 3:10:10| and while it is meeting potentially all of these specific requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11410)|
| 3:10:18| I'm not confident of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11418)|
| 3:10:20| but there are precedent-setting concerns as we see the growth in our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11420)|
| 3:10:26| that we're all trying to wrestle with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11426)|
| 3:10:29| and that's why I keep going, yes, we're getting close to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11429)|
| 3:10:32| but I'm uncomfortable with kind of a blank check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11432)|
| 3:10:36| I feel like we need to do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11436)|
| 3:10:39| I'm not exactly sure what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11439)|
| 3:10:41| but I'm not comfortable with voting in affirmative with that motion for those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11441)|
| 3:10:48| It just seems like there's some other reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11448)|
| 3:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11450)|
| 3:10:57| You know, right now we're considering the design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11457)|
| 3:11:02| and the alternative design and recommendations by NOS County Department of Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11462)|
| 3:11:06| not the concept plan, but, yeah, Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11466)|
| 3:11:13| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11473)|
| 3:11:16| The question that I'm trying to wrestle with and get a better understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11476)|
| 3:11:21| I know that there's a motion and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11481)|
| 3:11:24| but there was mention of conformity when we were discussing the concept plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11484)|
| 3:11:34| and it doesn't seem like this conforms with what is around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11494)|
| 3:11:44| But I'm trying to understand, because we've already established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11504)|
| 3:11:51| that it does check all the boxes of what is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11511)|
| 3:11:55| Is the conformity aspect an element of what is under consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11515)|
| 3:12:04| I think conformity is based on our sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11524)|
| 3:12:07| not necessarily what exists out there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11527)|
| 3:12:10| because what exists out there now is what somebody mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11530)|
| 3:12:14| These are estate-sized lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11534)|
| 3:12:17| and in this day and time it's not practical to require a property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11537)|
| 3:12:21| in my opinion, to be subdivided into estate-sized lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11541)|
| 3:12:27| We do need to provide alternative housing of all types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11547)|
| 3:12:32| and these lots, their minimum are 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11552)|
| 3:12:37| They comply with the zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11557)|
| 3:12:40| and personally I believe that the zoning dominates over anything else in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11560)|
| 3:12:46| These are rights that the property owners have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11566)|
| 3:12:49| to use their property in accordance with those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11569)|
| 3:12:52| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11572)|
| 3:12:54| I want to go one step further on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11574)|
| 3:12:57| I do have a little concern over what I hear from the developer and Mr. Harbin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11577)|
| 3:13:02| over the phasing of the project, when the sidewalks were put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11582)|
| 3:13:08| when we know where the improvements are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11588)|
| 3:13:12| but when the improvements are going to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11592)|
| 3:13:14| We don't know those specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11594)|
| 3:13:17| so a lot of it is going to rest on staff to determine that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11597)|
| 3:13:22| and I'm not sure that's fair on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11602)|
| 3:13:25| That's my two cents for what it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11605)|
| 3:13:30| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11610)|
| 3:13:31| Thank you for that explanation and answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11611)|
| 3:13:34| and I guess what I should have asked was for a better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11614)|
| 3:13:38| or definition of what conformity is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11618)|
| 3:13:41| and I think you hit it on the head on that, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11621)|
| 3:13:46| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11626)|
| 3:13:49| Well, it's me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11629)|
| 3:13:51| I have a few more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11631)|
| 3:13:54| I want to go back, Ms. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11634)|
| 3:13:57| to your comment about state law vesting versus our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11637)|
| 3:14:01| the code where we've got five years on a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11641)|
| 3:14:05| Which one takes precedence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11645)|
| 3:14:07| Because my concern is it goes back to the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11647)|
| 3:14:11| If TDEC allows 50 acres but Knox County is limited to 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11651)|
| 3:14:15| why is Knox County overriding the state there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11655)|
| 3:14:18| but the state overrides the county in another area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11658)|
| 3:14:21| Because, again, just being blunt and honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11661)|
| 3:14:25| they've been building four homes across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11665)|
| 3:14:27| and down the road from me for the last six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11667)|
| 3:14:29| and I'm about over it because of the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11669)|
| 3:14:32| I can't imagine 400-some-odd homes in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11672)|
| 3:14:36| The other thing that I want to talk about too is the sidewalk issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11676)|
| 3:14:40| We've seen this in several other developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11680)|
| 3:14:42| where the sidewalks are supposed to be put in later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11682)|
| 3:14:45| and then they never get put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11685)|
| 3:14:47| So I would want to somehow put a condition in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11687)|
| 3:14:50| sidewalks have to be built as each property is developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11690)|
| 3:14:53| so that we don't run into that issue, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11693)|
| 3:14:56| considering the size of this property where they never get built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11696)|
| 3:15:00| Because we had that in two developments in the south area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11700)|
| 3:15:04| just in the last couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11704)|
| 3:15:06| where it's now almost not possible to go back and put those in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11706)|
| 3:15:10| So those are some things we need to also be thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11710)|
| 3:15:13| with this size development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11713)|
| 3:15:15| So let's start with the first one of vesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11715)|
| 3:15:17| and what our five-year max for a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11717)|
| 3:15:21| versus the TDEC and Knox County disturbance of acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11721)|
| 3:15:26| Ms. Blakeney, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11726)|
| 3:15:28| I'm not sure that they're in conflict necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11728)|
| 3:15:30| but I wonder if this will help this provision from state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11730)|
| 3:15:33| So for development plans that proceed in phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11733)|
| 3:15:35| there is a separate vesting period for each phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11735)|
| 3:15:38| The standards in effect on the date of the local government's approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11738)|
| 3:15:41| of the preliminary development plan for the first phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11741)|
| 3:15:43| remains in effect for all later phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11743)|
| 3:15:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11746)|
| 3:15:47| Does that help clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11747)|
| 3:15:49| I mean, they're still going to have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11749)|
| 3:15:51| If they're not able to complete their project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11751)|
| 3:15:56| they will have to come back and get additional approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11756)|
| 3:15:59| doing an extension for their concept plan or development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11759)|
| 3:16:02| Yeah, and again, I guess I'm just –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11762)|
| 3:16:05| if it's going to be approved and there's no way –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11765)|
| 3:16:09| I mean, under the judicials where we have to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11769)|
| 3:16:12| because it complies with everything that we require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11772)|
| 3:16:15| I would almost rather say let them disturb 50 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11775)|
| 3:16:18| and be done in five rather than stretching it out over ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11778)|
| 3:16:20| just so that the neighbors have five years of at least some peace and quiet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11780)|
| 3:16:24| without the construction noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11784)|
| 3:16:26| But that's something that I don't know if we can override in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11786)|
| 3:16:30| because it's just – I think it's things that need to be taken into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11790)|
| 3:16:34| considering the size of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11794)|
| 3:16:37| And just looking at that area, I mean, that's a lot of traffic over a decade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11797)|
| 3:16:43| construction equipment, construction, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11803)|
| 3:16:48| Well, this is the vested property rights act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11808)|
| 3:16:51| So it's Tennessee Code annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11811)|
| 3:16:52| I don't believe that this body would have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11812)|
| 3:16:55| to override the vested property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11815)|
| 3:16:57| I'm not talking about the vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11817)|
| 3:16:58| I'm talking about where TDEC allows disturbance up to 50 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11818)|
| 3:17:02| Knox County keeps it at 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11822)|
| 3:17:05| If we were to say to Knox County, let them do up to the TDEC maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11825)|
| 3:17:10| which is 50, that would knock it down from ten, as Scott laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11830)|
| 3:17:14| to a five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11834)|
| 3:17:16| Keeps it inside the five-year concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11836)|
| 3:17:18| and it doesn't keep another five years of disturbance in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11838)|
| 3:17:21| of just noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11841)|
| 3:17:25| Leo, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11845)|
| 3:17:41| Could you locate a mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11861)|
| 3:17:44| Because it's difficult for members of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11864)|
| 3:17:46| and the audience to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11866)|
| 3:17:53| That 50-acre rule was submitted to TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11873)|
| 3:17:55| We have to submit to them every five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11875)|
| 3:17:58| and they approved that, the idea being keeping less area open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11878)|
| 3:18:04| and less erosion control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11884)|
| 3:18:07| We have granted waivers to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11887)|
| 3:18:09| The director can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11889)|
| 3:18:11| It's typically when we grant waivers, it's for a site that's steep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11891)|
| 3:18:14| where you need to borrow on the top side to fill the bottom side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11894)|
| 3:18:19| But that would be up to the director, and they could get a waiver to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11899)|
| 3:18:31| Commissioner Smith, do you have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11911)|
| 3:18:35| All right, so we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11915)|
| 3:18:40| Commissioner Graff, did you make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11920)|
| 3:18:42| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11922)|
| 3:18:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11923)|
| 3:18:46| Commissioner Graff made a motion to approve variances 1 through 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11926)|
| 3:18:49| and alternative design standards 1 through 8 per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11929)|
| 3:18:54| That was seconded by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11934)|
| 3:18:57| All in favor of that motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11937)|
| 3:19:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11940)|
| 3:19:01| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11941)|
| 3:19:03| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11943)|
| 3:19:04| We still have the issue of the concept plan subject to the 17 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11944)|
| 3:19:10| Again, I want to reiterate I'm more comfortable having phasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11950)|
| 3:19:17| something that is written, something that is part of the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11957)|
| 3:19:22| same way with the sidewalks, same way with the public or the amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11962)|
| 3:19:28| All I've heard is our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11968)|
| 3:19:31| We believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11971)|
| 3:19:32| We think it will be this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11972)|
| 3:19:35| It doesn't do us any good in terms of holding fast and firm when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11975)|
| 3:19:40| and how these things will be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11980)|
| 3:19:42| So that is my concern on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11982)|
| 3:19:45| I would appreciate any comments from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11985)|
| 3:19:48| When our attorney was reading all the stuff that you read there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11988)|
| 3:19:56| I think that you addressed that, that if it was brought up in the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=11996)|
| 3:20:02| it could be applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12002)|
| 3:20:05| If David Harburn will stand there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12005)|
| 3:20:08| and the developer will say that it's going to be in Phase 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12008)|
| 3:20:14| or it's going to be in Phase 2, that's the same as having it written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12014)|
| 3:20:20| Am I right about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12020)|
| 3:20:22| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12022)|
| 3:20:24| Can you hear a bill on the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12024)|
| 3:20:28| He said a lot of probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12028)|
| 3:20:33| You know, we had an earlier case just today where there was a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12033)|
| 3:20:40| who was asked to put something on the record verbally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12040)|
| 3:20:44| Do you commit to doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12044)|
| 3:20:45| He said yes, and we went forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12045)|
| 3:20:48| A different case, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12048)|
| 3:20:50| On that one is because we can't do conditions in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12050)|
| 3:20:54| That's why I asked that one on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12054)|
| 3:20:56| is because we are not allowed to do conditions in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12056)|
| 3:20:58| This is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12058)|
| 3:20:59| And I will note that that is one of the options that the Planning Commission has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12059)|
| 3:21:05| at this stage is to approve or approve subject to conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12065)|
| 3:21:11| So it would be an appropriate time to consider that at this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12071)|
| 3:21:17| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12077)|
| 3:21:18| In my view, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12078)|
| 3:21:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12079)|
| 3:21:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12080)|
| 3:21:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12081)|
| 3:21:22| If I could speak for a second, too, on the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12082)|
| 3:21:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12085)|
| 3:21:26| Part of the sidewalks is part of the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12086)|
| 3:21:31| I'm required to put the sidewalks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12091)|
| 3:21:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12094)|
| 3:21:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12095)|
| 3:21:36| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12096)|
| 3:21:37| I think so if there's a certain amount of traffic over a certain amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12097)|
| 3:21:40| That's in the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12100)|
| 3:21:41| That's not a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12101)|
| 3:21:42| That's a county policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12102)|
| 3:21:44| A county ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12104)|
| 3:21:45| It was adopted by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12105)|
| 3:21:47| A county ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12107)|
| 3:21:48| I misspoke there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12108)|
| 3:21:49| But it is a county ordinance, which the county knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| And they will not allow me to proceed unless I comply with that county ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12111)|
| 3:21:56| So I'm compelled to comply with the county ordinance for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12116)|
| 3:22:01| For phasing, I guarantee Mr. Christman would like to go just as fast as he can on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12121)|
| 3:22:06| But there's just so many variables out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12126)|
| 3:22:08| I cannot commit to you that we'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12128)|
| 3:22:10| I don't know what the construction schedule can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12130)|
| 3:22:12| There will be delays in construction, as there always are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12132)|
| 3:22:15| But we'll move just as fast as we can to go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12135)|
| 3:22:18| The demand is great right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12138)|
| 3:22:20| We think the demand – we saw the newspaper article today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12140)|
| 3:22:23| In the next ten years, the demand, they tell us, the experts tell us, is still going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12143)|
| 3:22:28| So we'll move just as fast as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12148)|
| 3:22:30| And if we can get this done in five years, we'll get it done in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12150)|
| 3:22:34| But to sit here and to commit to you today that we're going to do this much now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12154)|
| 3:22:38| and it's just impossible to commit to the phasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12158)|
| 3:22:42| that we'll do this many lots this year, this many lots the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12162)|
| 3:22:45| There's just too many variables out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12165)|
| 3:22:47| When will the amenities be put in? That's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12167)|
| 3:22:51| Okay, the amenities, the first phase we'll put in, in the middle of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12171)|
| 3:22:56| we'll put the community center in there the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12176)|
| 3:23:00| Now, the dog park, the access to the river, and the playground area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12180)|
| 3:23:08| as we develop in those areas, that will be several years further on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12188)|
| 3:23:12| So the amenities will be there first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12192)|
| 3:23:14| And I'll say also, too, that the higher ADTs on the roads will obviously be the ones that come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12194)|
| 3:23:20| so we'll have to put the sidewalks in at the first as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12200)|
| 3:23:23| because that's where the higher traffic will be going in our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12203)|
| 3:23:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12209)|
| 3:23:32| So those can be conditions to the approval, just what Mr. Harbin said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12212)|
| 3:23:39| He's talking about the community club, phase one, very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12219)|
| 3:23:45| That can be a part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12225)|
| 3:23:47| As can the sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12227)|
| 3:23:48| And the sidewalks, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12228)|
| 3:23:50| I would caution you on the sidewalks, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12230)|
| 3:23:52| The sidewalks are not within this body's purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12232)|
| 3:23:54| It is a Knox County ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12234)|
| 3:23:56| It's Chapter 54, Article 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12236)|
| 3:23:59| It is under the purview of Knox County Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12239)|
| 3:24:04| to determine the exact timing of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12244)|
| 3:24:09| But they are required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12249)|
| 3:24:12| Just not when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12252)|
| 3:24:14| They will be required per their ordinance, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12254)|
| 3:24:17| Just not when they're required, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12257)|
| 3:24:20| It doesn't specify when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12260)|
| 3:24:22| That would be up to the Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12262)|
| 3:24:25| Can we condition this based on what was submitted by Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12265)|
| 3:24:32| in their drawing yesterday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12272)|
| 3:24:36| I would want to confirm that with the Director of Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12276)|
| 3:24:39| or someone else who could possibly represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12279)|
| 3:24:41| I don't believe Mr. Stone is here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12281)|
| 3:24:46| When a plat is submitted and if there's sidewalks on that plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12286)|
| 3:24:50| they'll be bonded with the street bond for the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12290)|
| 3:24:55| My understanding is that they will also work this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12295)|
| 3:24:57| in the design plan phase of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12297)|
| 3:25:00| And so there probably might still be modifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12300)|
| 3:25:02| to what they sent you all today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12302)|
| 3:25:05| Also, their condition 17 of the approval requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12305)|
| 3:25:09| that the concept plan come back for approval by the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12309)|
| 3:25:15| That is a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12315)|
| 3:25:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12316)|
| 3:25:19| I recognize Commissioner Denton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12319)|
| 3:25:22| I wanted to speak in regards to the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12322)|
| 3:25:25| Public Works submitted a plan with highlighted streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12325)|
| 3:25:29| showing the location that they would recommend sidewalks be installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12329)|
| 3:25:33| up to the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12333)|
| 3:25:37| With the motion, under condition 13, I would like to add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12337)|
| 3:25:44| because it's coming from Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12344)|
| 3:25:46| where they would recommend the location of sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12346)|
| 3:25:50| Obviously, you can't plan or schedule timing for building things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12350)|
| 3:25:56| that gets into a contractor means and methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12356)|
| 3:25:59| As far as amenities, considering how many homes this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12359)|
| 3:26:05| and how long it could take, no one can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12365)|
| 3:26:09| It's maybe not feasible to put in all the amenities in Phase 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12369)|
| 3:26:13| and it's certainly a disservice to who will live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12373)|
| 3:26:16| for those amenities to go in ten years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12376)|
| 3:26:20| So I think it would be nice if it's a feasible request to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12380)|
| 3:26:26| no more than halfway through construction that amenities are installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12386)|
| 3:26:31| I don't think people that are going into Plot 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12391)|
| 3:26:34| would want to wait eight years to have access to the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12394)|
| 3:26:38| because that's in the back of that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12398)|
| 3:26:42| So those are just some thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12402)|
| 3:27:00| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scotsman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12420)|
| 3:27:02| I was just going to comment on the sidewalk issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12422)|
| 3:27:06| Normally what will probably happen is the builder is going to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12426)|
| 3:27:10| those sidewalks as he does those houses rather than putting them all in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12430)|
| 3:27:13| on the front end because they normally just get torn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12433)|
| 3:27:15| But the county does require substantial bonding, and it is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12435)|
| 3:27:21| If they are not ADA compliant in the way they're constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12441)|
| 3:27:27| and they're not all in, the county will keep the developers' money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12447)|
| 3:27:31| and they're pretty good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12451)|
| 3:27:34| So I don't think it makes a lot of sense to couch the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12454)|
| 3:27:39| on sidewalks up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12459)|
| 3:27:41| I think the county will administer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12461)|
| 3:27:43| Commissioner Scotsman, I want that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12463)|
| 3:27:47| But I'm struggling with some of the cases that we've seen over the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12467)|
| 3:27:53| and I cannot tell you their exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12473)|
| 3:27:55| But there have been cases where that just hasn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12475)|
| 3:27:59| Well, I would say, yeah, there are three or four that we've dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12479)|
| 3:28:02| out of the last ten years of hundreds of subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12482)|
| 3:28:06| Yeah, there are always guys that don't do things correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12486)|
| 3:28:09| but they come back because they want to get the condition removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12489)|
| 3:28:13| because they're trying to pursue that bond money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12493)|
| 3:28:17| That bond money will ensure compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12497)|
| 3:28:19| or at least they will come back and try to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12499)|
| 3:28:22| But the sidewalk world now is a lot different than it was ten years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12502)|
| 3:28:26| in terms of how it's enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12506)|
| 3:28:31| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12511)|
| 3:28:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12513)|
| 3:28:34| We have 17 conditions listed, so are we making the 18th condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12514)|
| 3:28:40| the community club going in during Phase 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12520)|
| 3:28:44| Is that the commitment from the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12524)|
| 3:28:51| And then have we defined Phase 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12531)|
| 3:28:55| Obviously, that's going to be a condition that we understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12535)|
| 3:29:02| and we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12542)|
| 3:29:03| Because I've been in subdivisions where they've made those promises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12543)|
| 3:29:06| and don't give it, and you have to fight it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12546)|
| 3:29:08| Well, we're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12548)|
| 3:29:09| Phase 1 is obviously we're going to, if you look at that phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12549)|
| 3:29:12| we've got to put that pumping station in with KUV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12552)|
| 3:29:15| and we have to comply with that and get all that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12555)|
| 3:29:17| So we're going to set that aside and set that ready for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12557)|
| 3:29:19| So at the end of Phase 1, we should be able to get that community center in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12559)|
| 3:29:23| because it's also going to probably, I believe we designed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12563)|
| 3:29:26| we're going to have a mailbox cluster box there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12566)|
| 3:29:29| and we're going to need people to be able to go in and get their mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12569)|
| 3:29:31| So that's going to be something critical that we get that built as soon as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12571)|
| 3:29:34| so they can get to their mailboxes and stuff like that with the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12574)|
| 3:29:38| So by the end of Phase 1, we should be complying with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12578)|
| 3:29:41| Can you clarify what Phase 1 is, kind of start to finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12581)|
| 3:29:45| What is Phase 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12585)|
| 3:29:47| Well, Phase 1 obviously is dependent on the amount of acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12587)|
| 3:29:50| we can break at any given moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12590)|
| 3:29:52| So Phase 1 is probably going to be removing the first 60 to 70 lots, we're guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12592)|
| 3:29:57| And then we're going to start that Phase 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| because I believe the community center at Phase 1 and 2 is where the community center is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12599)|
| 3:30:04| That first phase is going to be coming up off Ruggles Ferry and into that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12604)|
| 3:30:08| And then we're going to move that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12608)|
| 3:30:09| Then once we get to that point, the community center sits at the end of Phase 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12609)|
| 3:30:14| or in the beginning of Phase 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12614)|
| 3:30:16| It's right there on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12616)|
| 3:30:18| So it depends on how fast we can go, how we can get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12618)|
| 3:30:20| because we've got to put that pumping station in, and that's got to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12620)|
| 3:30:23| So can we define Phase 1 as by the completion of 70 homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12623)|
| 3:30:27| Roughly, I'd say probably about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12627)|
| 3:30:29| Whatever that complies to, you know, whatever that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12629)|
| 3:30:32| 70 lots or 70 homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12632)|
| 3:30:36| You tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12636)|
| 3:30:37| Well, no, I mean, you mentioned – I mean, I think 70 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12637)|
| 3:30:40| 70 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12640)|
| 3:30:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12641)|
| 3:30:42| 70 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12642)|
| 3:30:43| Something like that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12643)|
| 3:30:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12644)|
| 3:30:45| Okay, so can we add that to the 18th condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12645)|
| 3:30:47| that community club will be constructed and completed prior to Phase 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12647)|
| 3:30:55| and by the end of Phase 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12655)|
| 3:30:57| and Phase 1 is defined as the completion of 70 lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12657)|
| 3:31:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12664)|
| 3:31:12| Is there a motion yet, or is it still – are we just still conversing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12672)|
| 3:31:15| I made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12675)|
| 3:31:18| You made a motion on the concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12678)|
| 3:31:21| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12681)|
| 3:31:23| No, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12683)|
| 3:31:24| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12684)|
| 3:31:25| Could I make one comment, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12685)|
| 3:31:27| Commission, we'll allow this gentleman to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12687)|
| 3:31:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12689)|
| 3:31:30| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12690)|
| 3:31:32| I'm Bill Hill, William Hill, 708 Grays Road off of Ruggles Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12692)|
| 3:31:36| I have lived there for 75 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12696)|
| 3:31:39| I understand the concept of building houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12699)|
| 3:31:42| I used to be a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12702)|
| 3:31:44| But let me make one thing that we seem to have moved away from in this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12704)|
| 3:31:50| We have one developer who wants to make a lot of money developing a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12710)|
| 3:31:56| We have almost 800 homes in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12716)|
| 3:32:01| Many homes are represented here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12721)|
| 3:32:04| We are going to lose our way of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12724)|
| 3:32:08| Now, is it fair for 700, 600, 500 people to have to change their whole lifestyle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12728)|
| 3:32:15| for one gentleman to make a bunch of money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12735)|
| 3:32:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12738)|
| 3:32:22| The people who own the property, the Blakes, I used to farm that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12742)|
| 3:32:27| I know all about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12747)|
| 3:32:29| They would like to sell it and make some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12749)|
| 3:32:33| This gentleman is the one that's going to make the money, not the seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12753)|
| 3:32:36| The seller could make money by dividing the property up in smaller tracts or bigger tracts, 200 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12756)|
| 3:32:43| People would have the same lifestyle that we enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12763)|
| 3:32:47| But this lifestyle that you're forcing upon us now is going to destroy what we have in that end of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12767)|
| 3:32:53| and it is not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12773)|
| 3:32:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12776)|
| 3:33:04| Are we ready for a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12784)|
| 3:33:07| If you will allow, I would like for Amy to speak to that very comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12787)|
| 3:33:15| I think you talked about rezoning and sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12795)|
| 3:33:20| That's the point, that it allowed the rights of this developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12800)|
| 3:33:26| It's not our decision today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12806)|
| 3:33:29| It's the fact that the sector plan, that's a lot of public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12809)|
| 3:33:34| I'm going to let Amy take over to describe when he says, is it fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12814)|
| 3:33:40| Is it fair for the developer to have the proper zoning, the proper sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12820)|
| 3:33:47| and comply with all the regulations to not do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12827)|
| 3:33:52| So this is done during the public input of sector plan and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12832)|
| 3:33:58| Do you have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12838)|
| 3:34:00| Mr. Hill, I think that you covered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12840)|
| 3:34:05| It has been zoned this since 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12845)|
| 3:34:08| The sector plan does allow consideration of this number of units on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12848)|
| 3:34:15| And so I think it's up to this body to decide whether or not, as Ms. Blakeney has laid out very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12855)|
| 3:34:21| whether or not this concept plan should move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12861)|
| 3:34:28| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12868)|
| 3:34:29| One final question, and just because this happened last week with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12869)|
| 3:34:36| Since this plan and everything was done, and now KUB is looking at infrastructure for broadband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12876)|
| 3:34:41| is there any new things that would need to be added or any condition we would need to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12881)|
| 3:34:45| to make sure that that infrastructure was put in for that future thing so that they're not coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12885)|
| 3:34:50| and re-digging up, since I assume most utilities will be underground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12890)|
| 3:34:55| And to Commissioner Smith, my original statement with the sidewalks is that as each house is finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12895)|
| 3:35:02| that the sidewalk be put in at that time, not that they be put in ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12902)|
| 3:35:07| I just want to make sure that as a house is built, the sidewalk is put in all along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12907)|
| 3:35:11| so that we don't get 50 houses built and there's still no sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12911)|
| 3:35:18| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12918)|
| 3:35:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12920)|
| 3:35:24| Going back to the amenities and when they go in and so forth, they're not all in one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12924)|
| 3:35:32| So it seems to me that the amenities should be going in when that phase goes in that they're located in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12932)|
| 3:35:43| You wouldn't want to go over and build something just in a field that's not been developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12943)|
| 3:35:52| just because it's phase one or phase two and this is going to not even be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12952)|
| 3:36:00| until phase four or five or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12960)|
| 3:36:03| So I think the amenities, just being realistic, go in when you get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12963)|
| 3:36:11| That's the first thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12971)|
| 3:36:13| Second thing is I make a motion that we approve the concept plan subject to 18 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12973)|
| 3:36:21| We have a motion to approve the concept plan subject to the 18 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12981)|
| 3:36:25| Commissioner Graf, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12985)|
| 3:36:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12989)|
| 3:36:31| We have a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=12991)|

| 3:39:39| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13179)|
| 3:39:41| Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13181)|
| 3:39:42| Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13182)|
| 3:39:43| Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13183)|
| 3:39:44| Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13184)|
| 3:39:45| Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13185)|
| 3:39:46| Could I have some discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13186)|
| 3:39:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13187)|
| 3:39:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13188)|
| 3:39:49| No, I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13189)|
| 3:39:50| Go ahead, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13190)|
| 3:39:51| I thought you just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13191)|
| 3:39:52| Mike, are you handling this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13192)|
| 3:39:53| Who's handling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13193)|
| 3:39:54| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13194)|
| 3:39:55| I'd just like to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13195)|
| 3:39:56| tell me the distinction between this one and the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13196)|
| 3:39:58| let's say the Kmart up on Maryville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13198)|
| 3:40:01| because I think we denied that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13201)|
| 3:40:03| Yeah, the one on Maryville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13203)|
| 3:40:05| for those newer commissioners who didn't review that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13205)|
| 3:40:10| it was U-Haul was proposing to renovate a former Kmart shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13210)|
| 3:40:17| to an indoor self-storage facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13217)|
| 3:40:19| and they also proposed some outdoor self-storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13219)|
| 3:40:22| and outdoor self-storage is what we call the type you drive up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13222)|
| 3:40:26| and have the roll-up door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13226)|
| 3:40:27| so it's not a conditioned space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13227)|
| 3:40:30| They're proposing some of those in the parking lot of the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13230)|
| 3:40:35| The staff, we just didn't feel that it was an appropriate location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13235)|
| 3:40:39| to have those types of facilities being just in an open parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13239)|
| 3:40:44| Planning Commission agreed and denied at least the outdoor self-storage part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13244)|
| 3:40:50| and did approve the indoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13250)|
| 3:40:52| They appealed to the Knox County Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13252)|
| 3:40:56| and the Board of Zoning Appeals did overturn the denial of the outdoor self-storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13256)|
| 3:41:01| and did permit those to be installed in the shopping center parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13261)|
| 3:41:07| In that case, it was a much more open parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13267)|
| 3:41:11| where you drove into the shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13271)|
| 3:41:16| they were there in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13276)|
| 3:41:17| had other businesses that you had to drive past the storage units to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13277)|
| 3:41:23| In this case, it's tucked in behind an existing retail shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13283)|
| 3:41:28| so it wasn't quite as adverse to the location for this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13288)|
| 3:41:35| Usually where we would see self-storage is to the rear of a development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13295)|
| 3:41:39| and even though this property has two frontages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13299)|
| 3:41:41| it has a bridge highway frontage and it has Beaver Creek Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13301)|
| 3:41:45| Beaver Ridge, I always get that one wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13305)|
| 3:41:48| there's another one behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13308)|
| 3:41:50| has two frontages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13310)|
| 3:41:51| The side that the self-storage is on is on the residential side of their development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13311)|
| 3:41:56| not on the commercial side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13316)|
| 3:41:57| so we thought it was an appropriate spot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13317)|
| 3:42:00| And you can kind of consider this an expansion of the indoor self-storage facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13320)|
| 3:42:06| that they're already constructing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13326)|
| 3:42:08| It's under construction for U-Haul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13328)|
| 3:42:11| So it's basically part of an existing facility that they're constructing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13331)|
| 3:42:18| You okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13338)|
| 3:42:19| You good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13339)|
| 3:42:20| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13340)|
| 3:42:21| Oh, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13341)|
| 3:42:24| Can you speak to the buffering that will be implemented to protect from the lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13344)|
| 3:42:32| and then can we tell yet if there's a giant parking lagoon that's planned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13352)|
| 3:42:39| If there's a what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13359)|
| 3:42:41| The last part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13361)|
| 3:42:42| Well, I'm looking at the, that's not what's on screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13362)|
| 3:42:45| I'm looking at the case file and the property right up against the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13365)|
| 3:42:50| and then across the street there's the residential area, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13370)|
| 3:42:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13375)|
| 3:42:56| Can you speak to the lighting buffering that would be there to protect from lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13376)|
| 3:43:03| and then if what is right up against the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13383)|
| 3:43:06| is that going to be a parking lagoon or is that going to be a structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13386)|
| 3:43:12| Along Beaver Ridge Road, which is on the north side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13392)|
| 3:43:20| that's where the residential is just north of Beaver Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13400)|
| 3:43:25| Along the north side of their property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13405)|
| 3:43:28| there's going to be a row of evergreen trees planted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13408)|
| 3:43:33| Then between the trees and the first building is drive aisles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13413)|
| 3:43:39| So the building doesn't back up right to Beaver Ridge Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13419)|
| 3:43:42| it will be set back from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13422)|
| 3:43:45| The planned commercial zone has a 50-foot peripheral setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13425)|
| 3:43:49| so the first building will have to be at least 50 feet away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13429)|
| 3:43:52| from that external boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13432)|
| 3:43:55| The rest of the landscaping that staff is recommending would help soften| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13435)|
| 3:44:00| the edges of the buildings on the exterior part of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13440)|
| 3:44:05| and somewhat mirror how the other existing buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13445)|
| 3:44:13| have treated the external boundaries of their own development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13453)|
| 3:44:17| so shrubs and trees and such on the outside of their parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13457)|
| 3:44:22| So that's the intent there is to try to integrate this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13462)|
| 3:44:27| and to more closely match the overall development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13467)|
| 3:44:36| All right, everybody ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13476)|
| 3:44:38| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13478)|
| 3:44:39| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13479)|
| 3:44:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13481)|
| 3:44:42| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13482)|
| 3:44:43| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13483)|
| 3:44:46| Next on the agenda is the Westminster Dawn Show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13486)|
| 3:44:50| This is item number 28, use on review, file 7A21-UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13490)|
| 3:44:55| The applicant is Amanda Bartleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13495)|
| 3:45:00| The location, northeast side of East Emery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13500)|
| 3:45:03| east of Quarry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13503)|
| 3:45:05| Size of tract is 1.62 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13505)|
| 3:45:08| The zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13508)|
| 3:45:10| Existing land use is single family or residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13510)|
| 3:45:13| and the proposed use is a dog training facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13513)|
| 3:45:17| Staff recommendation to deny the request to allow a dog training facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13517)|
| 3:45:22| be permitted at 5307 East Emery Road because the proposed use is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13522)|
| 3:45:28| inconsistent with North County Sector Plan land use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13528)|
| 3:45:32| of low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13532)|

| 3:45:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13539)|
| 3:45:40| There is opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13540)|
| 3:45:42| Applicant, would you like to go first or would you like opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13542)|
| 3:45:45| No, I'd like to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13545)|
| 3:45:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13546)|
| 3:45:47| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13547)|
| 3:45:48| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13548)|
| 3:45:49| Come on, give us your name and your address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13549)|
| 3:45:52| Thank you for being so patient today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13552)|
| 3:45:54| Thank you guys for hearing me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13554)|
| 3:45:55| I'm Mike Bartleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13555)|
| 3:45:56| I'm located at 5307 East Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13556)|
| 3:45:59| I am the property owner and reside at the above address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13559)|
| 3:46:04| At this point, I would like to ask all my supporters to stand up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13564)|
| 3:46:10| and I want to thank them for making me who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13570)|
| 3:46:15| And while they stand, to get to the facts of what I'm doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13575)|
| 3:46:19| is by getting this use review on my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13579)|
| 3:46:23| we train one dog at a time in a detached garage that was on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13583)|
| 3:46:28| when we purchased it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13588)|
| 3:46:30| We made phone calls to the county if we could operate and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13590)|
| 3:46:35| Let me stick to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13595)|
| 3:46:37| I'm a little nervous, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13597)|
| 3:46:39| The building is approximately 260 feet off of Emery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13599)|
| 3:46:43| behind my residence where I live with my wife and four kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13603)|
| 3:46:48| That's not the dog training center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13608)|
| 3:46:50| That little building behind it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13610)|
| 3:46:52| It's 20 by 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13612)|
| 3:46:55| It is also a good distance from any subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13615)|
| 3:46:57| which is located on the south side of Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13617)|
| 3:47:06| This business will not decrease the land value or be a nuisance to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13626)|
| 3:47:11| I promise you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13631)|

| 3:47:43| If you drive down East Emery, you can't even see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13663)|
| 3:47:46| It's on the back partial of the smaller acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13666)|
| 3:47:52| There are no kennels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13672)|
| 3:47:54| We do not board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13674)|

| 3:48:01| we do it in the 20 by 30 garage that we added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13681)|
| 3:48:06| fixed it and made it able so we could train there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13686)|
| 3:48:12| There's no kennels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13692)|
| 3:48:13| I've heard that somehow we got placed under a dog training center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13693)|
| 3:48:17| as a dog training kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13697)|
| 3:48:21| That's not what we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13701)|
| 3:48:22| We're just dog training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13702)|
| 3:48:23| We're not overnight boarding anybody's dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13703)|
| 3:48:26| We train one dog at a time with the owner, an hour and a half, and they leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13706)|
| 3:48:30| We do about 20 to 25 dogs a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13710)|
| 3:48:33| and that's 45 dogs a day if they show up and don't cancel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13713)|
| 3:48:38| But without approval of this review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13718)|
| 3:48:43| it will make disastrous impact on the veterans, first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13723)|
| 3:48:48| I'm prior law enforcement with PTSD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13728)|
| 3:48:51| retired here from the Knox County Sheriff's Office as a canine handler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13731)|
| 3:48:55| and my passion is to act in God's trust, and that's what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13735)|
| 3:48:59| I'm still helping this community after what I had to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13739)|
| 3:49:04| But law enforcement, the civilians who suffer from PTSD and mental stress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13744)|
| 3:49:10| you guys know in this community they need help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13750)|
| 3:49:13| and I'm one of them people that can come and get a $60,000 free service dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13753)|
| 3:49:17| and I'll pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13757)|
| 3:49:20| And I want you to meet someone that's special to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13760)|
| 3:49:24| Come here, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13764)|
| 3:49:29| This is Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13769)|
| 3:49:31| He's got a dog named Gus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13771)|
| 3:49:33| An ironic thing, my best friend up north died named Gus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13773)|
| 3:49:36| The Lord, I believe, put us together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13776)|
| 3:49:39| What's your doggy's name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13779)|
| 3:49:40| Gus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13780)|
| 3:49:41| And this is Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13781)|
| 3:49:42| Say hi, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13782)|
| 3:49:43| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13783)|
| 3:49:45| Without this review being approved, I can't tell him I can't help him anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13785)|
| 3:49:54| He has a second chance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13794)|
| 3:49:57| So we have collected over 1,600 positive signatures to keep this going in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13797)|
| 3:50:06| I also read on your plans that you know and understand about the 13% and the 12%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13806)|
| 3:50:11| that makes up almost 30% of this county with mental disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13811)|
| 3:50:15| I sent you guys an e-mail, let me help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13815)|
| 3:50:18| Let me help with some of the people that I can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13818)|
| 3:50:25| We are flexible on times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13825)|
| 3:50:27| We're flexible on any recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13827)|
| 3:50:29| We just want to continue to provide this service to the people in this resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13829)|
| 3:50:36| in this county, in this city that deserves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13836)|
| 3:50:40| This is my passion, this is my dream, and this is all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13840)|
| 3:50:45| And I'll make it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13845)|
| 3:50:46| Just tell me how to make it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13846)|
| 3:51:04| If the approvals don't get approved, the nonprofit shuts down as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13864)|
| 3:51:08| And that's where my heart is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13868)|
| 3:51:11| I wouldn't be here if my canine dog didn't save my life the day he opened the bathroom door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13871)|
| 3:51:16| I bought this property for my family so I didn't have to live somewhere else to train dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13876)|
| 3:51:22| I wanted to do this to save money to put my kids through college and work from home and be with my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13882)|
| 3:51:29| I haven't lived with them for a year because I had to work somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13889)|
| 3:51:33| I'm not going to get into that, but guys, please take this into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13893)|
| 3:51:38| I'm not building a whole UPS facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13898)|
| 3:51:41| It's already there standing structure prior to when I bought the residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13901)|
| 3:51:46| Nothing's being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13906)|
| 3:51:48| It's being cleaned is what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13908)|
| 3:51:51| Trees are being removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13911)|
| 3:51:53| They've been overtaken by vines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13913)|
| 3:51:56| I've asked all my neighbors, spoke to everybody, but the facts are this is what I do at that residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13916)|
| 3:52:02| I live at the upper front of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13922)|
| 3:52:04| The 20 by 30 garage back in the back is where I train one dog at a time with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13924)|
| 3:52:10| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13930)|
| 3:52:12| That's all I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13932)|
| 3:52:14| And I hope that you guys will allow me to keep doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13934)|
| 3:52:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13937)|

| 3:52:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13942)|
| 3:52:27| Good job, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13947)|
| 3:52:30| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13950)|
| 3:52:35| Your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13955)|
| 3:52:37| My name is Jim Koren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13957)|
| 3:52:39| I live at 5309 East Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13959)|
| 3:52:43| If it be possible, as much as it liveth within you, let us live peaceably with all men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13963)|
| 3:52:50| That's from Romans chapter 12, verse 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13970)|
| 3:52:54| I think it's a good thing to say right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13974)|
| 3:52:57| I have lived at that facility, at that home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13977)|
| 3:53:01| I've been very fortunate to live there for a very long time, from when my parents first bought that home in 1967.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13981)|
| 3:53:08| So, over the years, we've had a lot of neighbors come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13988)|
| 3:53:12| All of them have been great neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13992)|
| 3:53:15| I've gotten along well with all of my neighbors that whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13995)|
| 3:53:18| I consider two or three of them very good friends, actually, to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=13998)|
| 3:53:22| That all changed when this business bought that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14002)|
| 3:53:28| I have a fairly stressful job that became even more stressful last December with the availability of both the Moderna and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines at the healthcare facility where I am employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14008)|
| 3:53:43| Besides my other patient care duties, I'm also responsible for the acquisition, storage, monitoring, disposition, dispensing of those vaccines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14023)|
| 3:53:53| To relieve that stress, I would go into my backyard, into my wooded area, and as the gentleman alluded to, try to eradicate a very aggressive vine called bittersweet, oriental bittersweet, that literally choked the life out of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14033)|
| 3:54:12| It's a great stress reliever to take a Maddox and to dig these vines up by the roots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14052)|
| 3:54:18| I've been able to do that until they moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14058)|
| 3:54:23| Every time I would go into my backyard or into the wooded area, which just happens to be adjacent to this property, two very large German shepherd dogs would bark as if they wanted to rip my limbs off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14063)|
| 3:54:36| That bothered me a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14076)|
| 3:54:40| That went on for quite a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14080)|
| 3:54:42| I guess I should have contacted the homeowner to discuss that and see if something could be done about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14082)|
| 3:54:48| But I figured that since they had no regard for patients, people's property, they gave a buffer area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14088)|
| 3:54:58| In the decimation of this probably half acre to three-quarter acres of wooded land, they left a buffer on the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14098)|
| 3:55:06| They left a buffer on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14106)|
| 3:55:08| They came right up to my property line and actually crossed over about 12 feet into my property, knocking over one of the few remaining trees that are still alive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14108)|
| 3:55:18| I'm trying to reforest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14118)|
| 3:55:20| There was no explanation, no apology, no nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14120)|
| 3:55:23| It was only after I contacted codes enforcement that it finally quit, at least for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14123)|
| 3:55:30| The problem is I haven't heard anything about anything that they had plans for until this very moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14130)|
| 3:55:38| Now, it's a little ironic given what he does and the fact that I take care of veterans myself at the facility that I work at, so I can understand where he's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14138)|
| 3:55:52| But you've got to be able to go into your backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14152)|
| 3:55:55| My whole concern about this is the noise factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14155)|
| 3:55:58| There's absolutely no privacy on my property, in particular that wooded area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14158)|
| 3:56:03| Like I said, they came right up to it and crossed over the boundary into my property to clear this land off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14163)|
| 3:56:09| That's where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14169)|
| 3:56:12| That is my concern as far as peace of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14172)|
| 3:56:16| I have none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14176)|
| 3:56:18| I got to the point where I didn't even want to go into my backyard or into my wooded area to try to relieve the stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14178)|
| 3:56:29| I think that's all I have, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14189)|
| 3:56:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14192)|
| 3:56:36| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14196)|
| 3:56:39| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14199)|
| 3:56:40| I should have been here Tuesday, and I could have saved everybody time by asking the questions then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14200)|
| 3:56:45| But I'm unclear as to why we're hearing this, because if it doesn't meet the sector plan, this feels like a drive-through in a single-family residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14205)|
| 3:56:58| It's a use-on-review, but if it doesn't meet the sector plan, how are we hearing a use-on-review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14218)|
| 3:57:05| Let me see if I can explain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14225)|
| 3:57:07| That is our concern, and the recommendation for denial is because the introduction of a commercial use into a low-density residentially designated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14227)|
| 3:57:17| When county codes identify this, one of the big challenges that we have in the county is how old the county code is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14237)|
| 3:57:26| It lacks proper definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14246)|
| 3:57:28| We see this with the food truck park that we're going to hear about shortly, and there's not a definition for dog training either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14248)|
| 3:57:36| So that's another challenge with the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14256)|
| 3:57:40| In most codes, dog training is a use that also goes along with dog kennels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14260)|
| 3:57:46| and dog kennels are allowed to be considered as a use-on-review in the agriculturally zoned areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14266)|
| 3:57:53| So that is how it came to be as a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14273)|
| 3:57:59| So, Ms. Brooks, you're saying that dog kennels would be approved, are allowed as a use-on-review in the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14279)|
| 3:58:06| So what would he need to do to make this a dog kennel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14286)|
| 3:58:11| I guess you could train dogs at a dog kennel, couldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14291)|
| 3:58:15| Again, the discussion that we've had with county codes is that they would consider this a use that could be considered similar to a dog kennel, dog training facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14295)|
| 3:58:28| And so that is how you all are hearing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14308)|
| 3:58:31| But you said that's allowed in agriculture, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14311)|
| 3:58:34| As a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14314)|
| 3:58:38| But the underlying sector plan designation is LDR, which is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14318)|
| 3:58:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14327)|
| 3:58:48| So again, because of the sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14328)|
| 3:58:51| Yes, and that's one of the criteria when we're looking at the use-on-review is does it comply with adopted plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14331)|
| 3:58:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14339)|
| 3:59:03| Could we see an aerial of the property and the adjacent property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14343)|
| 3:59:12| Could you take off the hatch marks or just look at them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14352)|
| 3:59:39| Commissioner Phillips, do you want him to zoom out so you can see the greater area or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14379)|
| 3:59:43| No, I'd rather zoom in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14383)|
| 3:59:44| Zoom in, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14384)|
| 3:59:45| I want to see the adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14385)|
| 3:59:47| I assume who's to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14387)|
| 3:59:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14389)|
| 3:59:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14390)|
| 3:59:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14391)|
| 3:59:56| Nick, can you keep on zooming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14396)|
| 3:59:57| Let's get as close as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14397)|
| 4:00:01| So the actual, that's the area right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14401)|
| 4:00:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14411)|
| 4:00:14| And the opposition, you're to the right of that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14414)|
| 4:00:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14416)|
| 4:00:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14417)|
| 4:00:20| The trees that you're referring to on the property line, are they no longer there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14420)|
| 4:00:25| Those trees are there as far as the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14425)|
| 4:00:31| The area that I'm referring to is actually where that arrow is pointing to the top of the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14431)|
| 4:00:38| That's where they cleared out all of the land up into and crossing over into mine about 12 feet towards the north end of where our property lines meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14438)|
| 4:00:50| So that vegetative area is gone, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14450)|
| 4:00:52| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14452)|
| 4:00:53| That is correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14453)|
| 4:00:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14454)|
| 4:00:56| Now, can I make one other comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14456)|
| 4:00:57| I think I had a couple of minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14457)|
| 4:00:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14459)|
| 4:01:02| I commend what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14462)|
| 4:01:04| I did not know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14464)|
| 4:01:05| I thought they were going to put a kennel in there with a bunch of, because they cleared out all this land for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14465)|
| 4:01:10| If they're just going to use one building, why would they decimate all the wooded area behind it, including up to my property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14470)|
| 4:01:16| I don't understand that, because the building, as you can see, is toward the middle of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14476)|
| 4:01:22| It's not, I mean, I don't understand why they would take out all the woods if they're not going to build a bunch of more structures back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14482)|
| 4:01:30| I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14490)|
| 4:01:33| I'm more about conserving property than I am about tearing down woodland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14493)|
| 4:01:37| That's why I've been battling this very invasive vine that he alluded to earlier for well over a year trying to get rid of it when I realized what it was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14497)|
| 4:01:48| You know, like I said, I commend what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14508)|
| 4:01:51| I agree with it 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14511)|
| 4:01:53| If that's all he's going to do is use that one building for a training facility and there's not going to be a kennel with dogs everywhere, I think it's a commendable thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14513)|
| 4:02:05| and I would agree with that if with one provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14525)|
| 4:02:11| I have planted a row of green giant arborvitae trees, three gallon, not that tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14531)|
| 4:02:19| They will grow tall at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14539)|
| 4:02:22| That's not enough of a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14542)|
| 4:02:24| I don't understand why he had to clear it all the way out, all the way to my property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14544)|
| 4:02:29| There's a buffer to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14549)|
| 4:02:31| There's a buffer to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14551)|
| 4:02:33| I would agree to plant in between mine three gallon green arborvitae trees where I planted mine to give kind of a double row of a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14553)|
| 4:02:44| I would be okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14564)|
| 4:02:50| Mr. Barlson, you want to step up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14570)|
| 4:02:52| You want to step to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14572)|
| 4:02:54| May my wife join me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14574)|
| 4:02:56| Sure, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14576)|
| 4:02:58| So I attached some of the fences that we installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14578)|
| 4:03:04| I don't know if they're attached to what you guys got and you can pull it up, but it also shows what we have done fence-wise and the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14584)|
| 4:03:13| Where his tree line he's talking about is where we planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14593)|
| 4:03:18| You can see it on the plan map of what we turned into planning development or building anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14598)|
| 4:03:23| We're not building, we're just putting up fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14603)|
| 4:03:25| I'm going to run a six foot privacy fence from my property pen up to my property pen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14605)|
| 4:03:31| The only problem is some are on my side and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14611)|
| 4:03:34| We'll agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14614)|
| 4:03:35| If I put a fence up like I planned to at the beginning, I don't want to plant any more trees because they're already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14615)|
| 4:03:41| And that group of trees that were there, they were all dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14621)|
| 4:03:45| I always say widow maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14625)|
| 4:03:47| They're all leaning on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14627)|
| 4:03:49| I got four kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14629)|
| 4:03:50| The last thing I want to do on my four wheeler in that wooded area is to be killed by a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14630)|
| 4:03:55| So all the dead trees were removed for our safety as well as everybody else that's on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14635)|
| 4:04:01| And if it was 12 feet on his property, I don't understand when he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14641)|
| 4:04:06| But I did try to reach out to him and rang his doorbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14646)|
| 4:04:09| He's got some leaning trees as well in his backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14649)|
| 4:04:12| My construction worker and I, I was going to go ahead and ask him if he answered the door and spoke to me that I would help take down some of your trees that are falling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14652)|
| 4:04:19| At no cost if you wanted them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14659)|
| 4:04:22| But I have not once since I moved in in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14662)|
| 4:04:25| I have tried to talk to my neighbor several times as my wife, my staff that helps me train, my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14665)|
| 4:04:34| And he's never, I've never heard his voice until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14674)|
| 4:04:38| So all my other three neighbors, they agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14678)|
| 4:04:41| But he would never talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14681)|
| 4:04:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14684)|
| 4:04:47| Chair will recognize Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14687)|
| 4:04:52| I guess my question is, Amy, does this qualify more as a home occupation than a kennel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14692)|
| 4:05:00| I had that same question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14700)|
| 4:05:02| But Knox County doesn't, well, I don't want to, Mr. Elliott, do you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14702)|
| 4:05:09| Mr. Elliott with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14709)|
| 4:05:14| We tried to consider it as a home occupation, but it has to be contained within that primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14714)|
| 4:05:19| You can't have a home occupation in an accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14719)|
| 4:05:22| So we couldn't allow them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14722)|
| 4:05:30| That kind of didn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14730)|
| 4:05:34| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14734)|
| 4:05:37| And Knox County determines uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14737)|
| 4:05:40| And so I have a question and then a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14740)|
| 4:05:44| So Steve Elliott, are we able to approve a use on review on this property for a dog training facility in that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14744)|
| 4:05:59| Yes, we feel like what they're doing would fit underneath the definition of a kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14759)|
| 4:06:04| So we could, as a body, approve a use on review with the sector plan being LDR and the Zoning Being Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14764)|
| 4:06:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14771)|
| 4:06:12| I would defer to staff on the LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14772)|
| 4:06:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14775)|
| 4:06:16| I mean, we do our best to provide you with our best professional recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14776)|
| 4:06:20| But you all can approve this as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14780)|
| 4:06:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14783)|
| 4:06:24| And if we approved it as a use on review, would it be unlimited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14784)|
| 4:06:29| Would it be limited to one dog?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14789)|
| 4:06:32| At that point, the use approved could go beyond one dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14792)|
| 4:06:36| Although he may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14796)|
| 4:06:37| You can put that as a condition of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14797)|
| 4:06:39| Just like it can be a – you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14799)|
| 4:06:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14802)|
| 4:06:43| So knowing that and where we are, these guys are both good guys, the applicant and his neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14803)|
| 4:06:50| Would it be a good idea to give this 30 days, let them talk about trees and fences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14810)|
| 4:06:56| and then maybe come back and see if they come together on something and we could move on it in 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14816)|
| 4:07:02| Is that something that anybody else sees merit in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14822)|
| 4:07:06| One of the things that my staff – this was a very tough thing for my staff to go out and issue this citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14826)|
| 4:07:14| But one of the things we hope coming down here was that there could be conditions placed upon the use in the zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14834)|
| 4:07:19| such as hours of operation, maybe some sort of sound barriers were suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14839)|
| 4:07:23| So we're not going to go shut them down until this owner of use dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14843)|
| 4:07:28| So we'd be in favor of a 30-day postponement if that works for everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14848)|
| 4:07:33| I'd be more in favor of trying to deal with some of those conditions today and just taking care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14853)|
| 4:07:37| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14857)|
| 4:07:38| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14858)|
| 4:07:41| Commissioner Grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14861)|
| 4:07:44| It seems to me that the easiest and best way out of there is to plant a row of trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14864)|
| 4:07:52| whether you're going to build a fence or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14872)|
| 4:07:55| The gentleman says, plant some trees down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14875)|
| 4:07:58| I'm good with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14878)|
| 4:08:00| Plant some trees down there, and it goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14880)|
| 4:08:04| That's the easiest and cheapest thing that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14884)|
| 4:08:09| Can you all agree on where that tree is and how many there can be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14889)|
| 4:08:12| Can you all right there sit down and talk to each other and say, how many trees do you want and where do they need to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14892)|
| 4:08:17| And let's move on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14897)|
| 4:08:19| Let me address one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14899)|
| 4:08:21| Someone did come to my front door, rang the doorbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14901)|
| 4:08:24| I work nine, ten hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14904)|
| 4:08:27| If it was during the day and if it was this gentleman, I did not know it was him, never heard from him again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14907)|
| 4:08:33| And like I said, when they literally trespassed on my property and clearing out all this land, that irritated me slightly, I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14913)|
| 4:08:44| I was trying to vent my frustration on attacking those bittersweet oriental root systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14924)|
| 4:08:53| If they will agree to plant another row of trees right on the side where I planted a row of small trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14933)|
| 4:09:01| having two rows down there in between the trees I planted so you get a zigzag effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14941)|
| 4:09:09| And again, I commend what they're doing because I'm all about doing good things and helping the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14949)|
| 4:09:14| That's why I work with veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14954)|
| 4:09:16| That's why I take care of veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14956)|
| 4:09:19| If you'll agree to that, I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14959)|
| 4:09:22| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14962)|
| 4:09:23| Have you seen the site plan that was presented as part of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14963)|
| 4:09:26| I have not seen anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14966)|
| 4:09:27| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14967)|
| 4:09:28| Nick, can you put the site plan up, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14968)|
| 4:09:34| Can I speak to this briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14974)|
| 4:09:36| So on page seven of your packet, Nick is going to pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14976)|
| 4:09:40| There is a site plan that was submitted by the applicant that does identify where they would put a chain link fence as well as a six-foot privacy fence if the use on review is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14980)|
| 4:09:52| So that's what you're seeing there on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14992)|
| 4:09:55| And they have stated in the documentation they submitted to us that they would be training one dog at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=14995)|
| 4:10:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15002)|
| 4:10:04| You know, the privacy fence, quite honestly, I'm more about natural barriers or borders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15004)|
| 4:10:12| It's much prettier to look at than a privacy fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15012)|
| 4:10:15| If they want to put a privacy fence, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15015)|
| 4:10:17| But I would prefer another row of trees right on the other side where I put my small row of trees that will grow up someday and give us both a little privacy in a more natural, environmental-friendly atmosphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15017)|
| 4:10:32| Can I get a witness on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15032)|
| 4:10:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15035)|
| 4:10:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15036)|
| 4:10:37| I agree to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15037)|
| 4:10:38| I'll buy the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15038)|
| 4:10:39| I'll speak to my neighbor, ask him where he wants it to make it look very natural and pretty for his retreat on his side, and we're compromised together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15039)|
| 4:10:51| And I'll start communicating on what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15051)|
| 4:10:54| I'll go even one step further than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15054)|
| 4:10:56| I'll help him plant them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15056)|
| 4:10:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15058)|
| 4:11:05| What do we do with the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15065)|
| 4:11:09| Well, my suggestion is we approve the application with the comments just made, and let's get on with this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15069)|
| 4:11:16| Well, my question is, are we approving it for adult training since there's nothing in the code, or are we approving it as a kennel, which is in the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15076)|
| 4:11:25| I think we just interpret it as a permitted use similar to a kennel, but it's not a kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15085)|
| 4:11:31| I don't think anybody wants a kennel out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15091)|
| 4:11:33| Because I was going to make the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15093)|
| 4:11:35| Yeah, I think the condition of one dog at a time and that it will not become a kennel where there are overnight stays with multiple dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15095)|
| 4:11:42| Okay, and that's why I was asking because I was going to make sure we had a condition that there are no kennels built on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15102)|
| 4:11:48| Hours of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15108)|
| 4:11:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15110)|
| 4:11:51| And will the use and review stay with the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15111)|
| 4:11:54| That was my other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15114)|
| 4:11:56| If it's sold, would this revert back to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15116)|
| 4:11:58| There would have to be a new use and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15118)|
| 4:12:00| There would have to be a new use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15120)|
| 4:12:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15121)|
| 4:12:02| With the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15122)|
| 4:12:04| So hours of operation, I'm looking for – because Scott did bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15124)|
| 4:12:10| I mean, considering the neighbor and the job he has and needing some downtime, would traditional hours of 8 to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday be acceptable for adults?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15130)|
| 4:12:21| What are the hours right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15141)|
| 4:12:23| Can I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15143)|
| 4:12:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15144)|
| 4:12:25| Our hours right now are from 12 until 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15145)|
| 4:12:28| The last dog leaves at 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15148)|
| 4:12:30| And the reason behind that is everybody like us, we work and we get about 2 or 3 after 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15150)|
| 4:12:36| Most of them come in between 12 and 5 and maybe 1 or 2 after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15156)|
| 4:12:41| And that's if they don't cancel or no show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15161)|
| 4:12:44| If they show up, but they're not going to show up with a busload of dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15164)|
| 4:12:48| If we need to move, if you recommend we move our hours to something that's where we have to open on Sundays or Saturday, I want to stay away from Sundays with church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15168)|
| 4:12:59| So are you only open five days a week or six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15179)|
| 4:13:02| We're five right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15182)|
| 4:13:03| Off on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15183)|
| 4:13:05| Close at five on Fridays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15185)|
| 4:13:07| So I'm looking to the neighbor as well because I want harmony in the neighborhood here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15187)|
| 4:13:13| Would the neighbor be fine if we were to condition 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15193)|
| 4:13:18| Again, knowing that half the year it's dark by 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15198)|
| 4:13:23| So knowing the job he has in the health department, the stress he's under, being able to come home and relax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15203)|
| 4:13:30| I mean that is important, especially considering what they have dealt with and what they're continuing to deal with at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15210)|
| 4:13:38| We've got to respect his time as well and his ability to decompress as much as we want to help those other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15218)|
| 4:13:44| I mean that's him spending time in his backyard is mental health therapy for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15224)|
| 4:13:49| So we've got to think about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15229)|
| 4:13:51| So would 11 a.m. to 6, which is one hour early, we're just moving the entire time frame up one hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15231)|
| 4:13:58| I would request not due to the fact that nobody gets off work until 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15238)|
| 4:14:02| We can't get them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15242)|
| 4:14:04| And we don't operate on weekends because we didn't want to upset the neighbors or the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15244)|
| 4:14:10| Because that's when most people are out is on the weekends is on, you know, spending time with their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15250)|
| 4:14:15| So, I mean, I would really request not to move that up due to the fact that we're just open five days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15255)|
| 4:14:23| Commissioner Smith, I would be in favor of the hours that they have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15263)|
| 4:14:28| But actually assuming that there may be some need as they're very popular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15268)|
| 4:14:33| that they might need to get a little more time on the morning side, half the evening side as they are doing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15273)|
| 4:14:39| but give a little more leeway for the morning side and use the days that they are operating now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15279)|
| 4:14:45| those being the conditions that we're setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15285)|
| 4:14:49| So Monday through Friday, let's just say 8 to 7 p.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15289)|
| 4:14:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15293)|
| 4:14:55| So they've got some room for growth, but it would be on the morning and not on the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15295)|
| 4:15:01| How does Matt say if that's fine with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15301)|
| 4:15:04| Sometimes I don't get home until 6 or 7 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15304)|
| 4:15:07| Neighbor agrees. I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15307)|
| 4:15:10| All right. Chair recognizes Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15310)|
| 4:15:14| Okay. I guess if no one has anything else, I was going to try to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15314)|
| 4:15:21| I know, right? I'm open to comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15321)|
| 4:15:24| I'd like to make a motion to approve this use and review subject to, let's see, 15 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15324)|
| 4:15:32| Staff recommendation shows 12, so I'm going to add three more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15332)|
| 4:15:36| That this facility stays a dog training facility and does not increase to a kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15336)|
| 4:15:42| That they're training no more than one dog at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15342)|
| 4:15:46| That a landscape barrier is put in place between the adjoining properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15346)|
| 4:15:51| and that their hours of operation are limited to Monday through Friday from 8 to 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15351)|
| 4:15:59| Excuse me, Commissioner, what are you referring to in terms of the conditions that you had mentioned to staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15359)|
| 4:16:06| Sorry, she's on the wrong file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15366)|
| 4:16:08| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15368)|
| 4:16:10| Was your motion that it was used to approve with the conditions that you just stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15370)|
| 4:16:16| Yeah, okay, to approve subject to three conditions as stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15376)|
| 4:16:20| I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15380)|
| 4:16:22| Before we go to vote, I'll recognize Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15382)|
| 4:16:26| Thank you. We've been here so long, it doesn't matter how much longer, so let's just stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15386)|
| 4:16:33| I can't get past, Director Brooks helped me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15393)|
| 4:16:38| Why didn't we just say either deny this, what you just laid out, but recommend approving a kennel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15398)|
| 4:16:51| Because as I read this, it just says we should deny this because it doesn't match the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15411)|
| 4:16:56| And then you go on in the comments down below that says, well, Knox County says it could be something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15416)|
| 4:17:02| even though you define the kennel as when people are away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15422)|
| 4:17:07| And so it's really not a kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15427)|
| 4:17:09| And I'm all for approving this, but it seemed like this got harder just because the recommendation was to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15429)|
| 4:17:19| Yeah, again, this one was challenging for us because of the lack of appropriate definition in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15439)|
| 4:17:25| But you've heard from Mr. Elliott, where they are the code administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15445)|
| 4:17:29| and so they see this as being able to be seen as a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15449)|
| 4:17:34| They're not operating a kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15454)|
| 4:17:36| So is this your way of staff not acknowledging that it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15456)|
| 4:17:39| They're not operating a kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15459)|
| 4:17:41| I don't think they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15461)|
| 4:17:43| They're only training dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15463)|
| 4:17:44| I think that would raise even more potential concerns if they were operating a kennel out of this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15464)|
| 4:17:49| And that's why I added the condition that it can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15469)|
| 4:17:51| I'm as confused as I ever was, but I'm going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15471)|
| 4:17:57| All right, Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15477)|
| 4:17:59| I'm wondering why can't the applicant just withdraw his request, and we don't have to deal with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15479)|
| 4:18:10| and they can plant their row of trees up there and take care of it themselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15490)|
| 4:18:15| Because I don't think CODES is going to turn their back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15495)|
| 4:18:18| Mr. Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15498)|
| 4:18:19| CODES wants to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15499)|
| 4:18:20| I don't think CODES administration wants to turn their back to this and walk away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15500)|
| 4:18:24| I also think this means they wouldn't come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15504)|
| 4:18:28| Yes, it's a commercial operation in the ag zone, so it needs use owner review to have the approval to allow them to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15508)|
| 4:18:36| Thank you, Mr. Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15516)|
| 4:18:37| Trying to work around all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15517)|
| 4:18:38| All right, so we have a motion and a second to approve with three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15518)|
| 4:18:43| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15523)|
| 4:18:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15525)|
| 4:18:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15526)|
| 4:18:48| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15528)|

| 4:18:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15531)|

| 4:19:40| Ms. Goines, welcome back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15580)|
| 4:19:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15582)|
| 4:19:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15583)|
| 4:19:44| You look more relaxed today than you were last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15584)|
| 4:19:47| I've been here for about five and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15587)|
| 4:19:49| I'm about as relaxed as I can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15589)|
| 4:19:52| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15592)|
| 4:19:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15596)|
| 4:19:59| Ms. Goines, do you have anything you want to add or are you ready for us to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15599)|
| 4:20:03| We were just going to ask that you approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15603)|
| 4:20:09| Motion to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15609)|
| 4:20:11| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15611)|
| 4:20:12| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15612)|
| 4:20:13| Hang on, we've got some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15613)|
| 4:20:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15615)|
| 4:20:17| I just wanted to ask about the noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15617)|
| 4:20:20| Noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15620)|
| 4:20:25| We had discussion about this in the agenda review, and I wanted to ask about ways that I would like there to be some type of condition that we can not have amplified music as part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15625)|
| 4:20:44| And I'm thinking about the residential neighbors around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15644)|
| 4:20:48| Is there something that we can do to put a condition that would prevent that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15648)|
| 4:20:55| You can trust the fact that I am very noise sensitive myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15655)|
| 4:21:02| I wanted to have a singer, really just a singer, maybe once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15662)|
| 4:21:13| I did have one of the neighbors across the road send me a text or make a comment somewhere or another, and he said, you know, if you could point the speakers toward the soccer field, and I told him, you really don't have anything to worry about, because if I do have anybody there to sing, it will be for one hour, once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15673)|
| 4:21:33| And I myself am very sound sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15693)|
| 4:21:37| I love the Fourth of July, but I cannot stand the noise, the fireworks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15697)|
| 4:21:42| So that's really not going to be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15702)|
| 4:21:46| But whatever you want me to do, I'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15706)|
| 4:21:57| I was going to say in reply, because we were talking about just noise ordinances about food truck parks in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15717)|
| 4:22:04| I personally wouldn't be opposed to sound amplification at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15724)|
| 4:22:10| I think it's more about maybe hours of operation, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15730)|
| 4:22:13| Not operation of the food truck park, but noise operation hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15733)|
| 4:22:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15739)|
| 4:22:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15740)|
| 4:22:21| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15741)|
| 4:22:22| You can't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15742)|
| 4:22:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15743)|
| 4:22:24| Oh, my goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15744)|
| 4:22:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15745)|
| 4:22:26| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15746)|
| 4:22:27| No, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15747)|
| 4:22:28| Someone was chipper-chappering, and I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15748)|
| 4:22:31| No, these microphones, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15751)|
| 4:22:33| No, it's more about, and it's not even about you necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15753)|
| 4:22:37| I think it's sort of like just shoring up code and whatnot in ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15757)|
| 4:22:41| Just making sure that music isn't going into like 8 and 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15761)|
| 4:22:46| And I know you're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15766)|
| 4:22:48| It's just an overall consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15768)|
| 4:22:51| And I guess since right now there's not really a county food truck park ordinance in effect, it's still being created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15771)|
| 4:22:58| I think that's what you're speaking to in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15778)|
| 4:23:01| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15781)|
| 4:23:02| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15782)|
| 4:23:03| And I think I'm sensitive to two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15783)|
| 4:23:07| Well, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15787)|
| 4:23:08| Amplification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15788)|
| 4:23:09| Like if it's just someone singing or playing rock on, but if it's amplified, that's the concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15789)|
| 4:23:15| because it can become a real problem for those around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15795)|
| 4:23:20| So indicating amplification, indicating the duration of time of amplification, not just the hours of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15800)|
| 4:23:28| If they were open from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. and they had amplification that entire time, that would be pretty rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15808)|
| 4:23:34| But if it was during operating hours for no longer than X, I'm not sure what that magic number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15814)|
| 4:23:42| One hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15822)|
| 4:23:45| Per the applicant, I would be willing to amend my motion to add a condition of no more than one hour per day of sound amplification to be done by 7 p.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15825)|
| 4:23:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15836)|
| 4:23:57| I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15837)|
| 4:24:00| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15840)|
| 4:24:02| Did we not get a note from Director Brooks about I thought it prohibited amplification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15842)|
| 4:24:08| It only prohibited the food truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15848)|
| 4:24:11| And that's specifically in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15851)|
| 4:24:12| I was giving an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15852)|
| 4:24:13| It came up on Tuesday, and so I was providing examples from the city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15853)|
| 4:24:18| Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15858)|
| 4:24:19| I mean, the food truck approval, I don't think we're re-approving the ability to broadcast sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15859)|
| 4:24:25| I think we're just approving the food truck, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15865)|
| 4:24:27| Do we even want to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15867)|
| 4:24:29| Well, it's not – and maybe this is more of a, like, workshop-type topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15869)|
| 4:24:34| It's not necessarily about the approval of the food truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15874)|
| 4:24:37| It's just the ordinance that would end up being associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15877)|
| 4:24:40| So it's kind of, like, gray area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15880)|
| 4:24:43| And I would hate to even box her into that condition with an ordinance coming up eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15883)|
| 4:24:49| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15889)|
| 4:24:53| Yeah, I think what Amy had said was that a food truck or vendor shall not use amplification equipment for any purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15893)|
| 4:25:02| Yes, and again, that's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15902)|
| 4:25:04| And as I mentioned on Tuesday, the county is going to be pursuing their own food truck park ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15904)|
| 4:25:11| and regulations specific to food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15911)|
| 4:25:14| So then can I amend mine that that would be in effect until the new county ordinance goes into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15914)|
| 4:25:19| at which time the county ordinance would take over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15919)|
| 4:25:24| And I would still second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15924)|
| 4:25:26| All right, we have a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=15926)|
