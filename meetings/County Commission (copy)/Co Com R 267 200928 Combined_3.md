| 7:56:54| together, sit down with the planning, and all of that will result in something coming back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28614)|
| 7:56:58| at some point in time in the near future. Yes, sir. I just wanted to make sure that was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28618)|
| 7:57:02| tenor of this body. That's what my department would like to do, but I wanted to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28622)|
| 7:57:06| this body was in agreeance to that. Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28626)|
| 7:57:08| I'll volunteer to be on that group. I would like to learn more about the processes and all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28628)|
| 7:57:12| kind of stuff as it is. Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28632)|
| 7:57:14| Do you got a volunteer? Mr. Snowden. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28634)|

| 7:57:33| And we can do that. The last time we had to sunshine them because we had Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28653)|
| 7:57:37| Phillips and Commissioner Utens, so we can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28657)|

| 7:57:53| on their behalf. I certainly didn't intend to do that. But the conversation we had was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28673)|
| 7:57:58| very productive. We talked about what safeguards we could put on the rural area, such as only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28678)|
| 7:58:03| allowing it on certain classified roads, allowing it within a certain distance of the planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28683)|
| 7:58:08| growth area, because we understand there are certain areas of the rural area where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28688)|
| 7:58:13| I live that aren't appropriate for some of these uses. But there are certain areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28693)|
| 7:58:17| to Commissioner Baylor's point, that aren't rural anymore, and they are applicable. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28697)|
| 7:58:22| we're just trying to find a good temporary measure to allow those landowners to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28702)|
