| 0:02:45| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| Okay, now for my mayor's report, which I think I'm going to have to take these glasses off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=167)|
| 0:02:54| Anyhow, I did want to start by saying happy Halloween.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| I'm going to keep my mayor's report short because I know many of us want to get back to our neighborhood events and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| and maybe go trick-or-treating or give out candy, all the fun things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| It's a very happy festive night for many of our neighborhoods, so have fun after this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| But for right now, I wanted to announce a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| First, this morning we broke ground on Callahan Flats, which this council has been very supportive of throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=201)|
| 0:03:28| It's another affordable housing complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| There's going to be 58 units designated for permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| which, as we know, is one of the best solutions for people experiencing chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| So 58 units of permanent supportive housing and 30 homes for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| And the city contributed, thanks to your support, almost $4 million to this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| So it's a $31 million project total, and the city's putting in $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| About $1 million from local funds and the balance from American Rescue Plan dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| This is another great example of the power of partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| So, so far, since I've been mayor, we've invested $38 million towards the creation of affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| which has leveraged $530 million in additional public and private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| As you know, projects like Callahan Flats are just one piece of the greater puzzle for addressing the housing crisis in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=260)|
| 0:04:28| So I just want to say that the city's investments are working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| and in the coming weeks I will be bringing more proposals to you that not only augment our existing housing strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=272)|
| 0:04:39| which we know work, but will also explore new innovative tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| For instance, to keep naturally occurring affordable housing, also known as NOAHs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| which I've discussed with many council members, including Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| NOAHs, natural occurring affordable housing, there's a lot of it in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| and we want to try some new strategies to make sure those naturally occurring affordable housing stay affordable via incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=298)|
| 0:05:06| And, of course, I look forward to bringing a middle housing proposal to you as soon as Planning Commission reviews it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| so that will be coming to you in the not-too-distant future as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| So the takeaway is we're making progress on housing, and there's more to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| I also want to announce three events that you're all invited to, council members and members of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| First, this Friday, a long-awaited improvement, Friday, November 3rd, 11 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=326)|
| 0:05:33| we will cut the ribbon and officially open the new Lancaster Drive sidewalk near South Doyle Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| This has been something that the community has really been eager to have, and it's already up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| and I've seen people walking on it. It's a really happy occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| We'll meet at Lancaster Drive at Tilson Street at the western edge of Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| This is the city's third major investment in pedestrian corridors just in the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| making a combined $6 million city investment in safe, walkable neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| And also a really great event that I would love city council members to join us for is Monday, November 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| you are invited to join Trees Knoxville, the University of Tennessee, and me and other city leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=371)|
| 0:06:18| at the tree board's Arbor Day tree planting celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| We celebrate Arbor Day in the fall because that's when you're actually supposed to plant trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| That's what's best for the tree. So Knoxville Arbor Day is November 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| and this will also highlight some recent grants that are going to help us implement our urban forestry master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=389)|
| 0:06:37| and expand our tree canopy in a way where we have more trees, better trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| and equitably distributed and maintained trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| So that's Monday, 2 p.m. at Harriet Tubman Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| The next event is a few weeks out. Thursday, November 16th, we are hosting an open house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| to discuss redevelopment possibilities for the former McClung Warehouse site along Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| This open house will be at the standard across the street from the site from 4 to 6.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=421)|
| 0:07:08| So opportunities for input will cover topics including historical and existing land uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| site design and layout, site programming, including housing and parking, connectivity, and public spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| And input from the open house will be used to inform programming and redevelopment of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| You can also follow along with updates about McClung's site on the project web page at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| knoxvilletn.gov slash mcclung. I hope you all can make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| And also for those of you not at this table but who may be watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| you know, there are a lot of people, if you've moved here after 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| you never saw the McClung Warehouses because they were already burned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| So it's that big empty lot between the train tracks and Jackson Avenue, sort of across from Sweet Peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=467)|
| 0:07:58| Quick reminder about the rules of decorum. Those who wish to speak either to a specific agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| or during public forum should sign up with Mr. Johnson, our city recorder, ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| Please do not use profanity when speaking to specific agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| Please remember to stay on topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| Those who fail to adhere to these rules will be ruled out of order and asked to step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| For those who are listening, please note you may not disrupt the public meeting from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| Those who do may be asked to leave. Thank you in advance for respecting these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| That concludes my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| Now we have reports from council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| I just wanted to thank the Parks and Recreation Department for the river outing that was with costume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=518)|
| 0:08:46| where I didn't wear a costume this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| Councilman Thomas also joined me and I'm really appreciative of Aaron Browning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| Deputy Director and Director Cheryl Ely and their staff who organized that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| as well as KFD staffed the river as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| I think a couple of people actually needed the services, so that was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| There was a really good turnout. It was very fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| It was a beautiful day on Sunday to go join neighbors and community members out on our river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| from Ned McWhirter Park to Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| I look forward to joining them for more activities like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| Thank you, Lady Liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| Yes, since our last council meeting, Knoxville has lost one of its finest citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| former Council Member Larry Cox, who represented the 5th District for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| But also beyond his work on council, he contributed to the community in many, many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=580)|
| 0:09:47| We had a nice service for him last Saturday. The mayor was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| Several city council people were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| It was at Fulton High School, which was very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| In the future, I'm going to be sponsoring a resolution to honor Mr. Cox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| but I did want to note his passing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=611)|

| 0:12:33| adjacent to Fulton High School, is benefiting our city in so many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=753)|

| 0:14:58| Nikki Lynn, speaking in favor of Item 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| Ms. Lynn, if you could state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| My name is Nikki Lynn, and I reside at the Rand Tillery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| I wanted to speak in favor of this because I've been here since the beginning of August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| requesting that the council take affordable housing seriously and to reevaluate the crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| So I'm very excited to see these things rolling along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| I'm excited to hear about the work and looking into NOAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| I do want to bring the council's attention to something that I discovered when reading the agenda packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=932)|
| 0:15:41| So under both Item 11B and 11C, you'll find that there is a provision in here that is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=941)|
| 0:15:54| I'll cite it for you if I can find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Under affordability, that's four, and it will be found under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=956)|
| 0:16:07| Anyway, it's the affordable section with the developer and the leasehold owner agreeing to only charge fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| that are customarily charged in rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| Developer and or leasehold owner may not charge uncustomary fees like laundry room access fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=978)|
| 0:16:27| or servicing origination, processing, inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| or other such fees for the cost of providing home ownership assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| However, the developer and or leasehold owner may charge reasonable application fees to prospective tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=995)|
| 0:16:44| parking fees to tenants only if such fees are customary for rental housing projects in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1004)|
| 0:16:52| and fees for services such as bus transportation, meals, as long as such services are voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| So my concern is C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| We found across the city that in order to apply for housing, that these application fees are becoming outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1024)|
| 0:17:13| Even if they're customary across the board in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| that's something that you as a council can look into waiving or requiring that those not be charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1036)|
| 0:17:23| because it's explicitly said that there are fees here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| So I am in favor of this because it's affordable housing, but I urge you to take a look at that piece, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Council, that concludes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| People have signed up to speak to this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1056)|

| 0:17:54| What was I thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Anyway, I would like to give you an opportunity to kind of highlight some of the benefits of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| and anything you would like to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| As you know, we're quite excited about having this in our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| and the way this has all come together, checked a lot of boxes and fits well into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| So I would like to hear you, I guess, give a little summary about how this came about and what it entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1092)|
| 0:18:22| Kevin DeBoe, Housing and Neighborhood Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| Thank you, Councilman Thomas, for the opportunity to talk about some of the affordable housing development going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1105)|
| 0:18:34| We really believe that the way to close the gap on a housing crisis is to prime the pump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1114)|
| 0:18:46| with our private monies so that we can leverage other public and private funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| And so the way this is set up is we're gap financing a significant project on affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1133)|
| 0:19:02| It is in the corridors on an area that is heavily populated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1142)|
| 0:19:13| And we have partnered with Dominion before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| This is just another example of that partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| I think the developer, Mr. Cobb, is here, as well as Ben Bentley, who is taking a very robust role in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1163)|
| 0:19:36| Yes, if Mr. Cobb's here, I would like for him to come down and maybe say a few words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| or maybe another representative of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| You can state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| Hi, I'm Jordana Nelson. I'm the Vice President of Development for DGA Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| My address is 333 West Depot Avenue, number 209.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| I'm a poor substitute for Craig, but he has little kids that are trick-or-treating tonight, so he sent me in his stead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| I would just say this is a 184-unit development. We're very grateful for support from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| As I'm sure you all know, interest rates are really creating a challenging environment for developing this type of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1208)|
| 0:20:15| and so this type of support is really critical to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| I'm glad to answer any questions that you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| Can you expound a little bit about the possibility of the park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| That was part of the negotiation, I suppose, in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| Sure. So when we found this piece of property, we were really excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| If you have any familiarity with it, it's nearly 40 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| but only the front portion that borders on Merchant Drive is actually zoned for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1238)|
| 0:20:45| The back portion of the parcel is all wooded and is under hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| So as we started the development, we started thinking about what we could do to provide an amenity for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| and also to preserve that part of the property, and so we've been working with Legacy Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| and we plan to donate a really significant portion of the property, I think 25 acres or more, to Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1261)|
| 0:21:09| They're being very patient with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| We are planning to at least get the site graded before we make the transfer of property to make sure, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| that I didn't mess up and not give ourselves a grading easement or something else that we needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| but that we are very much engaged in that process and excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| Okay. I just really did want to commend the work that you did and Mr. Cobb did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| This was like a textbook way, I think, of the way developers should engage with council members and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1291)|
| 0:21:38| I believe you came to us even before you went to planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| and you were able actually to do something that three or four previous developers had never done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| and the neighborhood is really happy with the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| It's going to check a lot of different boxes as far as a significant amount of housing that's on a corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| and in green space to the neighborhood, and the design, I think, will fit quite well into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| So I really, really appreciate what you did here, and the neighborhood does too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you so much, and again, thank you for the partnership from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| And just to address one more thing, I was texting with our management group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| We do not charge application fees, so hopefully that's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| Okay. No application fees. Good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| I also note that this affordability period is for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| Is that correct? 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| So this is going to remain affordable for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| That's really good news too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| Ms. Parker, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| I just wanted to echo some of the things that I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| I appreciated many of the details that were included in this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1366)|
| 0:22:55| and it shows that some of the things that we've been pushing for are starting to be considered and incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1375)|
| 0:23:09| We may be limited when it comes to state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| but when we are talking about how we are spending our dollars or running our incentive programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| we've got to take advantage of that opportunity to get the outcomes that we desire for our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1398)|
| 0:23:28| And I just wanted to encourage that we continue to look at the items that Ms. Nikki Lynn lifted up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1408)|
| 0:23:37| and also work to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| I saw some language around energy efficiency and meeting standards that the city has placed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| and I think when it comes to our incentive programs and funding programs in that area, we can even do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1428)|
| 0:23:56| So I just wanted to lift that up as an area that we continue to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| and strengthen as we develop these affordable housing projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| but we also want good affordable housing, all around good affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| What is the timeframe for the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| So we are very hopeful that we're going to close on our funding the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| That's the current plan, and we plan to commence construction immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| We expect it to be a 24-month completion period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| I believe there are four buildings, so typically what we do is when the first building is completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| we start a staggered lease up, so we hope to be leasing units before 24 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| but construction can be a bit unpredictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| So it will probably be late 25 at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| And then just kind of a quick question, just because I'm not –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| I do have rentals, but not of the magnitude and not in the same manner that you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| When you have people who are low income or kind of restarting and building up their credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| when you do, how do you handle that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Like do you not rent to certain people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Are those barriers, people who have low credit scores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| or other things that come up in their checks when they do their application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| They can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| We do have criteria when we rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| I don't want to speak in too much detail because, to be candid, that's not my area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| and I'm afraid I'll say the wrong thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| One thing that we're seeing is we're currently leasing up another project in West Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| and what we're seeing is that evictions have been a big issue on people's records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| and so we're taking it on a case-by-case basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| and trying to work through those issues to try and help people be able to rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| and also protect ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| I may have some more questions offline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| I know someone in particular that's looking for a unit for their family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| and I know part of the issue is their background and their history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| and low credit score and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| and so these are all things that are barriers in addition to income or the rental amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1573)|
| 0:26:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| I understand, and I'm glad to provide my contact information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| and put you in touch with our management company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Ms. Parker, did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| Ms. Ryder, the new system of lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| This takes a little getting used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| and amounts not to exceed $750,000 from the Affordable Rental Development Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| to DGA Holston GPLLC for the development of 25 affordable rental housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| to be located at 2120 River Willow Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| There's one person signed up to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| Ms. Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| So pretty much the same things that I said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| We're very excited to see more affordable housing happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1641)|

| 0:30:03| Happy Halloween.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Carter Hall, Director of Strategic Policy and Programs for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| Just to start with a short background on where we're at with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| personal delivery devices, as defined in y'all's agenda packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| are basically these small to medium-sized, kind of look like mini refrigerators on wheels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| They're typically electric and autonomously operated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| so they don't actually have somebody sitting behind them controlling them all of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| They're usually pre-programmed ahead of time to be able to navigate a space just based off a pre-programmed grid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| and be able to respond to things like you've probably seen with autonomous vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1842)|
| 0:30:49| UT has actually partnered with a personal delivery device company for a couple of years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| I think the program launched in early 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| At the time, they had reached out to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| I had several conversations with them about how they would want to manage that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| After some discussion, they had decided to just stick to their program to be on campus and state-owned streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| so that wouldn't impact any city right-of-way or city sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| including Cumberland Avenue or any of the streets next to campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| That program has been going since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| We've had basically zero problems with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| It seems like the technology works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| The robots are really cute, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| We've had no real reason to need to respond with an ordinance prohibiting these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| or otherwise establishing a permanent policy for these going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| That being said, as the years have gone on a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| we've seen more of these companies come up and be established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| and also move not just into larger cities, but some mid-sized cities as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| and just generally how these technologies and companies progress with their market expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| They tend to look at cities very similar to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| cities that have a lot of youthful populations that are all about using apps to get things to them quicker, more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1926)|
| 0:32:14| That's something where we think, hey, if a company was going to expand anytime soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| they might look at Knoxville as a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| Due to the fact that we do not have a regulation on the books that would prevent a company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| from setting up shop and starting to use our right-of-way for business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| similar to what happened with scooters in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| we're proposing putting this six-month moratorium in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| to where a company couldn't come in while we're still trying to think through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| and just give us some six months to think through, talk to other cities that have done pilot programs with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| talk to cities that have outright prohibited them, talk to industry experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| talk to the companies themselves, get an opportunity to talk to the company that operates on UT's campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| to see what their experience has been, and importantly, talk to stakeholders that might be impacted by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| Talk to people who might want to use it, see what the benefits might be, the impacts to businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| But, yeah, that's the general point of the moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| is while we're taking our time to have a thoughtful policy that we would bring for adoption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| it would prevent a company from coming in and setting up shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| Thank you for the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| And so when you talk about, I think we all are familiar with seeing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| They are cute on UT's campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| However, when you think about other companies coming in, and once the floodgates open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| and when you talk about a concentration of where their business populace would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| my mind automatically goes to the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| And we know how busy downtown as far as walkability is during the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| as well as the weekends during UT games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| And so we'll look forward to hearing back on that due diligence and what other cities have experienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| But I do see that there could be some problematic things that could happen as it relates to a safety issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| because they are low to the ground with a lot of, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| So I'll look forward to hearing back on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Yeah, I just want to be clear that this does not mean that we are definitely going to move forward with a pilot on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| There's just as good of a chance, I would say, that we would do the research and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| hey, maybe this technology, this business model isn't the right fit for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| It seems to work good on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Maybe we should just keep it to campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| You know, there are a lot of things we'll look at, talk to traffic engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| talk to KPD and their traffic safety team to make sure that any technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| any business that is operating here, safety is obviously the number one concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Mr. Swanson, how often can we extend a moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| Because I'm doubtful that in six months, I mean, we studied scooters for much longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| so I'm hopeful we'll have a recommendation in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| But how long can we postpone this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| I'd love to give you a definitive answer to that, but I cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| It's as long as the court says we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| But I think what the cases have shown is that if you are, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| attempting to design something that will work, as long as you're not just putting it off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| but you're actually attempting to accomplish something with the moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| the court will continue to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| And I would assume attempting to do something would be decide whether we want it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| That, and maybe design standards for each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| If you decide you do want it, you have to design standards for how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| But we don't have to decide we want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231031?start=2146)|
