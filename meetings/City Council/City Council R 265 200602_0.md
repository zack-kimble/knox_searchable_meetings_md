| 0:11:59| I hear these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| And stand with those who are ready to work towards change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| We can all do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| So I want to start by talking about some policing issues that have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| I want to start by talking about some policing issues that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Not only in the last month, but more acutely in the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| The tragedies that have occurred recently in Minneapolis and too many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| other places center around law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| There are numerous best practices from across the country for how cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| can improve interactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Between police and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Especially communities of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| And how to ensure accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=749)|
| 0:12:36| Knoxville and KPD thankfully already reflect many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| In the last month and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| We have also approved a number of cameras for patrol officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| Which I supported as one of my first acts as mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| You all approve the funding for these cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| As part of the FY 21 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| Which begins July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| We're in the final stages of the procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| Which act, which includes active field testing of the proposed equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Our team is pushing hard to have a contractor city council for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| contractors to begin deploying those cameras on patrol officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| We will work with urgency to get these cameras in the field as soon as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| but I do want to be clear that while we expect the contract to be ready in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| we won't see cameras worn on officers until later in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| I know there's I have a strong sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| of urgency and so does everybody who's working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| It just takes a little time to do it appropriately, legally and correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| Another important element is community oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| In 1998, Knoxville was one of the first cities to establish an independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| civilian oversight board, the Police Advisory Review Committee, also known as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| Park Park and Community Oversight serve a critical role in law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| accountability, providing independent review when residents feel as though their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| rights have been violated or infringed upon by those who are charged to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| and serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| As we finalize our search for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| executive director, I'm going to appoint someone with integrity who has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| courage to tackle tough realities and who can serve as a bridge between law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| enforcement and the communities they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| One of the key questions I'm going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| asking the final candidates is what ideas they have for how the city can improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| trust and relationships between the community and KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| Another important tool is law enforcement assisted diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| There's been a lot of discussion both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| within the administration, as well as this council, about how law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| might work in deeper partnership with social work professionals to divert people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| from jail and into social service organizations who can help them get the help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| The Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| the BHUC, is a prime example of our law enforcement assisted diversion effort and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| one that the city has supported since its opening in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| And council just last month approved the continuation of that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| We also take very seriously the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| for additional social workers to work alongside our KPD officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| We've been working on increasing outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| worker capacity for some time, and this summer KPD will be hiring a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=900)|

| 0:15:08| homeless, in addition to the two existing positions that are already funded via| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=908)|

| 0:15:15| Chief Thomas and I are committed to continue to explore and implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| additional strategies to improve public safety and public order while reducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| the need for traditional criminal justice intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| I'll also note here that it's critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| that we protect the mental health of our police officers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| Stress, exhaustion and trauma do not mix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| well with the realities that face our officers on their beat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| not knowing what the next moment might hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| Protecting the mental health of our officers is yet another important piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| in ensuring they have the tools they need to de-escalate situations and effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| intervene in crises. In July, KPD will launch an officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| wellness program, a part of which is an effort to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| destigmatize mental health treatment by coupling an annual mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| evaluation as part of each officer's annual routine physical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| So big picture wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| the good news in the midst of so much not so good news, the good news is that everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| on this council wants to work towards greater justice and equity, as do I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| Everyone on this council is against racism, as am I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| As mayor, I want to help us move from being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| against racism to being actively anti-racist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| I learned about I first learned that term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| I'm a big reader and I want to recommend a book to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| This book, Stand From the Beginning, won the National Book Award in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| I read it a couple of years ago and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| the first place where I read and started to understand what anti-racism is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| And that's what I want to help the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| move towards, both as a government and as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| How will we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| The good news is we do not need to reinvent the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| Knoxville is already a member of the Government Alliance on Race and Equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| which supports local governments in working to achieve racial equity and advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| opportunities for all. The city formed an internal equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| committee several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| I served on it while I worked for Mayor Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| And GARE is one of the organizations we've turned to for training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| resources and metrics on issues of race and equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| And looking around this Zoom call, I see a lot of elected leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| not just willing, but eager to call out individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| institutional and structural racism and to prioritize equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| I'm encouraged by the commitment I feel and see around me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| I'm encouraged by groups such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Community Voices and the Equity Framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| We are collaborating with them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| We are facing deeply rooted challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| and recognizing the problems as the first step to fixing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| And with your help, Knoxville can and will become a more just and equitable city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| So what are the next steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| One of one of the things I always think is important is to keep listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| I always listen first and then take and learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| from that and then come up with collaborative plans for change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| The next week I'll be listening and answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| questions, answering questions at a June 9th event put on by Knoxville Renaissance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| called State of Emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| It's a panel discussion via Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| We're going to be talking about police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| forces in our community, systemic black barriers, how to support black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| businesses and schools, mental health and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Our city empowerment director, Charles Lomax, will join me on this panel and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| be asking my senior staff to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| I'll be listening and encouraging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| conversations across the community among all races at our dinner tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| at our workplaces, at our houses of worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| Racism can be really hard to talk about and is even harder to undo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| It took a brutal, brutal civil war to end slavery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| It took decades of struggle and Jim Crow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| and lynching to secure voting rights for black Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| We have to undo racism in our hearts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| and minds to truly become a more just and equitable city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| And I'm ready to do this work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| That concludes my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| Thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1142)|

| 0:22:23| Floyd, it wasn't so much that we were shocked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| that it happened, because this is something that has plagued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| disproportionately the African-American community for for hundreds of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1350)|

| 0:23:02| are going to listen and who are going to take action to help make things better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1382)|

| 0:23:09| But again, I just wanted to thank everyone for all that you're doing to help as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1389)|

| 0:26:41| OK, Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| if you could start by stating your name and address for the record and then you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| This is actually Charles Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| Oh, OK. Trent will be speaking after I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| You can go. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| I would just like to say we're bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| this before the commission today because we feel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| the denial by the Board of Zoning Appeals was based more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| Or the opinion put forth by the Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| Association rather than the actual merits of the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| the the fact of the matter is that these the lot in question is a lot of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| It has been a lot of record since eighteen ninety nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| when the interstate was brought through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| It cut part of the law off, which reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| the size to below the required amount and therefore caused the hardship for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| The.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| It the reduction of the size of the law is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| the only issue regarding our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| to build on this law, we meet all of the other requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| By zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| as far as the setback requirements, parking, impervious surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| all of those things are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| met and the the basis of the argument, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| for the homeowners is that they are saying that North Third Avenue is not a street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| but it is an alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| And according to the city's records and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| we spoke with Adam Cone top with the city engineers, it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| classified as a city street and not an alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| And so we feel like the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| The appeal should be granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| we went through the process before purchasing this lot of contacting people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| at the city engineer's office, we were assured along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| that this was a lot of record and that it was buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| And we really did not get indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| that we were going to need a variance until further on through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| After we had made the purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| And so we just feel that the the reaction from the neighbors and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| emotional response, because they simply don't want a house built across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| the street from them, does not change the facts that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| we are placed in a hardship and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| not granting us the variance denies this equitable use of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1791)|
| 0:29:59| And I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| I will stop there and turn you over to Trenton Smith, he's going to fill you in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| on some other details as far as the processes we went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| prior to purchasing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| OK, people we spoke with in regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| Mr. Smith, before you sign up, could you just state your address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| I think I forgot to ask you that at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| My address is nineteen sixty four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| Harbor Hills Drive, Dandridge, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Mr. Trenton Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| please start. Are you on the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Yes, I'm here. OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| You have up to five minutes to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| and you can start, please, by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| Yeah, my name's Trenton Smith and I live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| at 708 East Woodland Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| As was mentioned before, prior to purchasing this lot, we reached out to several people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1853)|
| 0:31:00| both at City Engineering and Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| We reached out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Linda Perucci with the Stormwater, who we reached out and asked if she had any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| concerns with the buildability of these lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| And I think the email correspondence is in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| packet so you can kind of see how that conversation went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| She referred me to Jody Van Horn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| and I was referred to Jody Van Horn by a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| When we reached out to her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| she informed us that these were lots of record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| that they would not need to be replatted and that they would not require a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| to build upon due to the minimum lot size requirement not being needed for a lot of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1902)|
| 0:31:50| It was not until after we had purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| the lots and gone to the historic zoning that we were told that a variance would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| And at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Peter Ahrens spoke from the zoning department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| gave us assurances that the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| Would be in support of building on these these lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| so as far as the the street that these are on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| as Charles mentioned, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| the street has been a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| There was an ordinance that made it a street in 1967.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| So it's been a street for over 50 years and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| You know, we're just looking to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| to have equitable use of our property based on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| the lots in question that the issue with them is that due to them being partial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| we need a variance because they're under 5000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| But there's 43 lots within the Fort McGill neighborhood that are built on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| lots that are under 5000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| So this is this will not be an anomaly within the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| It's consistent with with other lots within the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| And the only reason that we require the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| variance is because they were made partial by the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| If they were located anywhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| in the subdivision, we would be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| Building them anyways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| we feel that our project is, you know, it's going to add value to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| You know, there's there's lots of drive for densification near the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| which this promotes and just just overall, I think, as I stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2021)|
| 0:33:51| the facts of the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| would lead to the granting of this variance, if not for the emotional response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2035)|
| 0:34:03| tied to some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| residences of Fort McGill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| Does that conclude your remarks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| It does. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| OK, now the three people signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| against this, starting with Bob Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| Mr. Wetzel, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| Can you hear me now? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| Please start by saying your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| You'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| Yes. Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| My name is Bob Wetzel and I live at 1015 Luxor Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| And I want to thank you for this opportunity to speak tonight on the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| that we feel very is very important to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| And yes, at times we get emotional about a place that we know and love and want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| So let's start out with the two items that have identified as a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| One was the creation of a substandard lot when the interstate went through in 1964.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| That is absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| Part of that lot was taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| The house that was on that lot was taken and Third Avenue was wiped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| So they had to come around and had but one house was left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| They had to find an address for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| So they renamed the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| Third Avenue, it's very clear from the ordinance that was passed, it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| that's ordinance four, three, nine to an ordinance to name an alley in city block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| that that that North Third Avenue, it doesn't reclassify that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| It doesn't make it a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| It just says it renames it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| And the body of the ordinance, it says November 9th, 1960, naming to name an alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| in city block section one, then an alley beginning at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| and then call it North Third Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| So our first condition, it is an alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| It's not a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| It doesn't look like a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| It doesn't act like a street that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| garbage cans, fences, all that stuff that alley has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| And most of you guys know what alleys in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| this community look like, and this is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| And we don't think it's a good idea to start building houses that place alleys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| and then the back of the house faces an interstate wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| We think that's just cramming things in just a little too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| And it's not on the original street grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Yes, we need we have smaller lot sizes, but they're all on the original street grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| The interstate blew up the original street grid in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| So there's one number to all the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| Well, number two on his hardship was the city guy gave him some bad information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| We can't argue that sounds like he got some bad information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| We just don't think the neighborhood ought to have to suffer because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| We think other issues need to get resolved in some other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| I don't give you that answer tonight, but this is not the way to solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| So second, another reason we're opposed to this is every one of the neighbors who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| lives on that that east side of 900 block of Elmer Street thinks this is a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| We've had over five families buy in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| in the last two years that spent over two million dollars on their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| They did that with the understanding those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| properties were unbuildable lots that they could count on as being a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| between them and the interstate, and they are very much opposed to this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| When we had a Zoom discussion with Trenton, with the board, neighborhood board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| we mentioned three times, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| We mentioned more than ever, really three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| It's a street, not an alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| It sets a precedent and all the neighbors oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| And on that one, he said, well, there's nothing I can do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| It just moved right on into the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| I think it's very important to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| that they're opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| And it was kind of a cavalier answer, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| All right. Number three, third reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| we do think it sets a precedent, a very bad precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| both on a small scale and a bigger scale on the small scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| If this variance gets approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| you'll see another variance for the lot right next door to get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| And there's another lot just right up this alley that's about the same size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| that somebody might decide they want to get a variance on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| These lots are bought for $10,000 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| The traditional building lots in 4th and Gill this year in the last six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| have been selling for $30,000 to $35,000 a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| So this guy, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Smith, has bought him two lots for $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| So we're afraid if this goes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| he'll come through and ask for a variance on the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| And then we won't have one house on the alley, we'll have two houses on the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| On the bigger scale, up until last fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| really since January this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| you had to have 7,500 square feet to build in 4th and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| We supported going to 5,000 because we believe in small houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| We believe in small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| We believe in density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2321)|
| 0:38:41| We believe in a lot of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| What we don't believe in is you ought to be building houses on alleys that are just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| remnants of an interstate construction project at this point in time and haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| changed in the last 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| So those are the kind of the three big ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| A couple of other things we talked about value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| It's not going to add any value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| I mean, you can talk that way, but it's not going to add any value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| I didn't see why he would want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| way behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| What was that, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Thirty seconds ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Good. I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| He wanted he wants he wants government to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| wave a hand and make what was unbuildable lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| He got a low price, buildable lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| And unless my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| who are signed up to speak, Amy and Gordon want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| I think we've probably said what we need to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| We need to be respectful of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| There's not a lot more we can add to this argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| We can just banter back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| So if that's good with my neighbors, I think we can just go into the Q&A session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| Well, I want to make sure they're OK with that, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| Gordon Coker, you signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Do you still wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| I think Bob said everything we need to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| OK, Amy Bolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| Miss Bolling, I don't know if you're on, but you signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| I don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| Take that opportunity away from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| You hear me now? OK, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| This is Amy Bolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| I'm at nine one eight Eleanor Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| And yes, I do agree with everything that Bob said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| The only other concern that I had was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| regards to it being an alley and in just the safety of, you know, building a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| back there, you know, getting fire trucks, things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| that into that alley should something happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| It's right behind my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| You know, I just kind of worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| But then also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| And I just don't see being a desirable home for someone to invest in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| So my concern is, you know, once the home is built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| really, what's the feasibility of someone actually buying a home in that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| And that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| OK, thank you, Miss Bolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| The.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| The appellants now have up to two minutes for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| Neither of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| Smith's wish to speak after hearing the other people say they're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| OK, if you could just tell us this is I'll speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| I'm Trenton Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| OK, you have up to two minutes and you can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| I just want to reiterate as far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| that ordinance was was read off as far as whether it is a street or an alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2489)|
| 0:41:36| The city has a zoning website that lists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| the streets of Knoxville on that website, alleys are not listed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| On that list and North Third Avenue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| listed, so it is differentiated from alleys, and it is also, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| we spoke with Adam Conta with city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| He says that the city views that as a city street and it meets all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| requirements in their eyes to be serviceable as any city street would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| And as far as the desirability of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| lots, I think that's a question of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| So I won't get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| But if they have the opinion, they wouldn't be desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| That's that's an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| any structure within within the neighborhood adds value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| as far as the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| He said that you used to need seventy five hundred to build in seventy five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| hundred square feet to build in Fort McGill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| They move that down to five thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| I just like to reiterate that all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| lots within there have been deeded for so long that there are lots of records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| So you can build on a three thousand square foot lot in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| As long as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| It's a lot of record, I mean, that's not the only requirements requirement for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| variance is because it was made partial by the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| And as far as the discussion about the alley, again, there's many homeowners that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| live across the street that are in violation of ordinances and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| violations, as far as fences that aren't supposed to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| debris that's around, that's actually them decreasing the value of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| And so, you know, how they treat that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| we don't think right, but we wouldn't make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| an issue with it as long as we're given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| The use of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| That's your full two minutes, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| Yes, I would like to have a couple of different questions for staff members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| Mr. Frost, I would like to ask you to touch on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| criteria for a hardship because that's the basis for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| So if I can have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Go through the criteria for hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| Well, the standards in granting a variance, it's now in 16, I guess, point three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2640)|
| 0:44:10| H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| And please bear with me, we haven't had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| something like this a little while, variances will be only granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| where special conditions or circumstances such as exceptional nearness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| topography or siding fully described in the side and the findings of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| and the case council do not apply generally in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| Two variances will not be granted to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| a use otherwise excluded from the particular district in which is requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| Three, for the reasons fully set out in the findings of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| the four set circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| the provisions of the code would deprive the applicant of any reasonable use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| of their land, mere loss in value does not justify variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| There must be a deprivation of beneficial use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| Any variance granted must meet the minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| Fifth, the granting of the variance must be in harmony with the general purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| and intent of the code or might be injurious to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| detrimental to the public welfare or in conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| with the general plan for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| And then in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Smith gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| they have the burden of showing that the granting of the permit will not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| contrary to the public interest, the literal enforcement of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| will result in unnecessary hardship that the grain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| that by granting the permit contrary to the provisions of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| the spirit of the ordinance will be observed and that by the granting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| of the permit, substantial justice will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| And then there's the limitation that the variance granted must be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| I was going to ask if Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| Aaron's could have some questions from him about a lot of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| These are things that we discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| during the recode process, which we just passed in August of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| At that time, the minimum lot standard was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| seventy five hundred square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| And my understanding is that ties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| to multiple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| But it was reduced thirty four percent down to five thousand square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| And this request is for an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| reduction of 12 feet, 12 percent, 12 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| from the standard that we just passed in August 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Mr. Aaron's, could you comment on a lot of record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| and the comment that this only requires a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| What is making the necessity that that for them to ask for a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| Peter Aaron's city of Knoxville plans review and inspections director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2838)|
| 0:47:25| The lot is just over forty four hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| square feet and I think it's forty nine point something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| feet wide and the minimum lot dimensions are 50 feet wide and 5000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2852)|
| 0:47:40| I understand there was a telephone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| conversation prior to the purchase of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| There was nothing official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| That's that's basically a staff member giving the best information they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| given the limited amount of time, limited resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| Typically, when folks are seeking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| an official answer, they'll ask for a zoning letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| They'll ask for the process to take place before they commit to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| Once the application for the permit came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| in, we did our official evaluation and saw that the lot was substandard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| and identified it and went through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| The city has a lot of substandard lots within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| And this was a situation where they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| not asking for reductions in setbacks, increases in lot coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| They presented a package that provided the required parking off street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2919)|
| 0:48:48| They met the setback, the lot coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| And we also understood as as the historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| overlay in that district requires, they'll be going through the historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| zoning commission process to make sure that the any proposed structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| is consistent and and well, consistent with the historic neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| And so for those reasons, we didn't oppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Sometimes if folks come in and it's obvious that they're trying to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| a structure that's too large for the property and they're asking for an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| increase in lot coverage or they're asking for a reduction in setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| that's that's a situation where it's obvious their proposal doesn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| And so we would in the BZA process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| oppose that because they're trying to shoehorn too much onto the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| That wasn't the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| So that's why we did not oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| But Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| Aaron's the comment that any lot of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| size, that's a lot of record is a buildable lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| Can you clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| if there is a lot that's identified on the lot on the word map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| it's three thousand square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| You can build on it as long as you meet those those other requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| These lots had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| other indicators on there that the staff who the applicant spoke to was unaware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| of identifying that they were partial lots, they were remnants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| which can be confusing to look at the word map and see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| Yeah, it's got a word map number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| but there's some other language on there that they may not have understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| We do, so it always required a variance to be able.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| To build on it. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| And that's where the confusion came. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| So there was never a guarantee that the variance would be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| OK, because there was no letter, there was nothing official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| The guarantee that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| OK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| I would like to ask Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| Captain Sharp a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| Peace can hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Chief Sharp, I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| Hello, I'm here. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| Yes. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| So I know some of the commentary is about the access to this land, which is why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| all the houses that were there were cleared because their access was taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| And the one house that remains is a woman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| who stayed until she passed away fairly recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| It's nine foot wide of pavement to get back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| It's an alley and it says so in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| It was given an address for one elderly or maybe not elderly in the 60s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| but someone who stayed in their home for quite some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| is the only home that remains at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| The interstate went in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| What kind of access is needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| For emergency vehicles to get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| Normally, we would look for a minimum of 15 feet to be able to get any of our fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| trucks in there now that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| that doesn't mean that we couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| necessarily squeeze them into a narrower roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| But normally, that's what we look for is a 15 foot roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| And then I have a question for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| Smith, the applicant, if he's still on the line and can hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| That's what you saw on Trenton Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| I mean, yes, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| So you do own two lots there, not just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| Thank you for and they're they're adjoining, they're side by side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| I'll let my colleagues ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| I am not inclined to believe a hardship exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| I feel that this is a safety issue of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| accessing back there, and I feel like if we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| If we we do set a precedent of we've already reduced the lot size, 34| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| percent, this is a request to reduce an additional 12 percent to potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| domino effect, multiple structures back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3217)|
| 0:53:43| With no way to access with emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| vehicles, with things that close that that's one of the reasons that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| setbacks is because of fire leaping from one structure to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| And many of the things in the city that have smaller lots that don't meet current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| fire standards were built long before we had these fire standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| I believe Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Smith has the ability to build on a larger lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| He's so I don't feel that the hardship exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| Thank you. Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| And I had a question a little bit about our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| process for determining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| A road that is functional to use language from engineering, reviewing the materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3269)|
| 0:54:36| I was surprised to see that that, you know, that kind of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| determination was coming from engineering, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| that was a road where someone could build and where emergency services could could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| reach, if that's all we have within our processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| It seems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| To determine what, where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| It's hard to figure out my word, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| when this when this item came to my attention, I was very surprised because I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| you know, just grown up here, know this area very well and never noticed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| alleyway and certainly wouldn't think of it as a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| So the idea that someone could build a house and there would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3326)|
| 0:55:36| garbage pickup and fire services and all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| accessing that road was surprising to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| So I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| Where within our zoning code or within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| our processes, do we determine whether a street is functional or is that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| determined by engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| You want to answer this or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| did you have a particular person you were addressing this to, Miss Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| Well, that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| I didn't know that was for engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| Ask them if this is their sole decision to make or Peter Aarons or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| Well, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| I mean, yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| Peter Aarons, director of plans, review and building inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| The zoning code regulates private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| and what folks can do and how they can do on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| I hate to throw Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Cannon in the in the fire here on his first week on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| But I know engineering has a traffic division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| I know that they regulate a lot of the things that are within right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| And that's where streets are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| And so I'm sorry, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| Cannon, but I have to defer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| Mr. Cannon, it's your second day on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| Are you on the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| OK, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| I guess the honeymoon's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| If you and if you don't have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| tell us what your answer is as far as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| Councilman Parker, I'll do my best here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| We did go through the history on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| today to have a better understanding of what took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| And the original ward back in 1888 showed it as an alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| Bob is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| I'm looking at the ordinance number forty three ninety two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| which renamed the alley to its current Avenue designation, North Third Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3448)|
| 0:57:38| We did not have time to go back to the council record as to why that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| So let me apologize to you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| But we it seems to be and this was back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| Caswalkers day, believe it or not, Caswalker and Dwight Kessler on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| that the intent was to make sure that this house and it appears even the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3475)|
| 0:58:02| adjoining properties had access to an addressable street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| None of the lot lines were eliminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| back then of the other lot lines were not eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| There seemed to be some intentionality and doing this name designation both for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| addressing and it would allude to the access to those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| But to their actual action, I do apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| We did not have that information for counseling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| No problem, that is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| It just seems like there's a step missing for for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| You know, there are as we have new standards that come along for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| For streets and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| before a new development would be able to take place, it seems the city would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| to go in and widen that street to current standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| It is what you're saying, I completely understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| And this is a very unusual situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| because you do have some structures that come right up to the alley itself right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| You have some of the existing residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| that are using the alleys access to their garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| And I'm not speaking just for the single home that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| I'm talking about the others that front one of the other streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3562)|
| 0:59:28| I'm not doing a very good job of answering your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| let me jump in this day to break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| So I think you you bring up a very important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| Councilwoman Parker that yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| engineering's job is determine how the how that right of way is designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| And so this was, again, as Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3583)|

| 0:59:57| an ideal standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| And so I think that's really why this process exists is for city council to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| evaluate this very unique situation and try to make a determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| about about all of the factors that go into this field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| Thank you, that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| You go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3618)|

| 1:00:23| So I do have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| This is interesting because I used to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| on that block of Eleanor on the east side, so my backyard would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| diagonal to these properties, but I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| Mr. Smith, I read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| Have you already been through the historic zoning commission process or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3638)|
| 1:00:44| We are currently in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| We've submitted some things and gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| feedback and then we will make another submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| And then how does it go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| And then here's my question, and this is for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| Aaron, so they own both 16 and 17, so there's a theoretically a double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| lot that they own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| Can they go in and then just build without any variances on those two lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| A single dwelling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| As they lay currently, no, because the lots or the partial lots are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| smaller than the required 5000 square foot, 50 foot wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| If perchance they were to one lot, subdivide them and combine them together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| then they could then they could build a single family dwelling on the double lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3697)|
| 1:01:44| But they would have to remove that lot line between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| Right. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| And then just curious on that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| I mean, I'm just trying to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| you know, there's obviously been a pretty significant investment made on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| properties, you know, and for equitable use of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| properties and just trying to figure out what their options would be moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| And then what that how how cumbersome that process is, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| on are they ultimately going to build on there and get through some process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| of being able to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| There's the potential that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| Someone could come in and purchase those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| partial lots and go through the subdivision process, create legal lots of record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3751)|
| 1:02:38| that meet the minimum size requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| So obviously, if there's seven partial lots on that on that block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| it might be reduced down to five or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| And then as long as they proposed dwellings that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| Meet the setbacks, provide the off street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| parking, do not exceed the lot coverage and comply with anything the Historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3778)|
| 1:03:06| Zoning Commission requires, then, yes, there is the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| for that north third street to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3789)|
| 1:03:17| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| OK, I think that answers my question at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| Thank you. Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| Miss Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Aarons, could there be an administrative one lot for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3807)|
| 1:03:34| For it to be one buildable lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| This one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| The engineering department is more involved with the subdivision process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| and I know that they have made some changes recently to facilitate the removal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| of lot lines between adjacent properties, I can't speak with any sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3837)|
| 1:04:04| I can't speak to the administrative rules there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| Is that something Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| Cannon would want to comment on his second day at work or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| I'll do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| I can offer you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| all the administrative flats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| My understanding is that there are no variants as part of that planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| that it may very well be eligible for the administrative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3869)|
| 1:04:36| In this particular case, I think we would have to look at it closer to see if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| are any potential variances that would have to be done as part of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| And that would probably determine what route it would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| That has not been requested of us yet, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| But if it's one lot and it meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| The dimension requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| It should, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| So woman writer, your errands again, I'm being told the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| OK, be a text, so somebody else listening in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| And I agree with that text based on Peter's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| So based on that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| I do not believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| The standards for meeting a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| for granting a variance of the math, and I'm going to make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| A motion made by Councilman Ryder to deny the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3943)|

| 1:05:52| I just want to chime in and say I think it's really important that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| people that want to build a house or anything on a property know what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| guidelines are, and I'm frustrated with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| Smith of the misinformation, particularly that he was given or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| unclear information about whether to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| I plan to vote to deny it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| But I share your frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| OK, any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| OK, hearing none, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=3988)|

| 1:08:24| If you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| and address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes to speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| agenda item. Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| My name is Alex Fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| I live at four three zero four Lurigo Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| I'm a rural letter carrier here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| And I've been closely following the situation at the post office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| And the basic situation is pretty simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| that with so many businesses shut down and with the recession and lots of small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| businesses closing because of the virus and the recession coming from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| Mail volume is way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| The last reports were it was down about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| 30 percent and expected to be down by about half by the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| So the post office is making vastly less money than it was and is expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| to run out of money and not have enough money to meet its operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| Originally, it was projected to happen this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Now they're saying maybe early next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| But regardless, we're losing money very fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| because expenses have remained about the same and revenue has gone way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| So, you know, for those who don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| the post office currently is entirely self-funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| We receive no taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| But for the first 200 years of our history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| until about 1970, that was not the case where we're a federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| institution and we received, you know, federal subsidy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| to make up operating costs for some 200 years before that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| So there's no reason that can't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| And I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| So, you know, it's not just a matter of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| you know, a bailout, the post office employees, 600,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| It provides middle class jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| In particular, it's historically been a path to the middle class for veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| We may still be the single largest employer of veterans in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| I believe that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| And, you know, the second or third largest employer of black Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| But also, it's you know, it's more than a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| It's not we're not a private business for a public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| And there are a number of reasons it's very important that we continue functioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| as a public service and don't have to face cuts to service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| or staffing as a result of this crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| I mean, in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| people are relying on us right now more than ever in the midst of a pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| to deliver essential goods when it's not safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| arguably, to go to the store yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| People have turned to the post office to deliver stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| And even outside of this context, year round,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| rural people in particular rely on the post office because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| millions of rural Americans, including some in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| lack access to affordable broadband, in some cases don't have access at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| Or in other cases, it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| vastly more expensive in rural areas than it is in urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| We deliver over a billion prescription medicines every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| Rural Americans who are small business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| owners rely on us for shipping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| We do free pickups to every, you know, at every address in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| And, you know, our delivery is universal and affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| It's the same price no matter where you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| Fifty five cents for a first class letter compared to some FedEx is like fifteen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| dollars to send an envelope to many rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| And of course, in a pandemic, it's becoming particularly important that people are able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| to vote by mail in places where that's allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| And cuts to the Postal Service would threaten that that Democratic right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| So I think it's important that the post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| office remain functioning as a universal, affordable public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| The twenty five billion that's named in this resolution is the amount that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4320)|
| 1:12:05| contained in the so-called Heroes Act already passed the House and Congress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| that this resolution was written before that passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| But it's now passed in the House and will be put forward in the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| The Postal Board of Governors and the unions have all requested a much greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| sum than that, some seventy five billion dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| But the twenty five billion would at least allow the post office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| to keep its doors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| For the foreseeable future and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| some ongoing funding can be found in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| So I would encourage I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| that we encourage our representatives and senators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| to support this and support the post office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| So I encourage counsel to adopt the resolution and also would encourage anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| on council or anyone in the public listening to directly contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| Representative Burchett and the Tennessee senators and encourage them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| Thank you, Mr. Fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| There are no other people signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| Motions have been made to approve and seconded by Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| Yes, I'd like to sign on the post co-sponsor of this resolution, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| OK, let the record reflect that Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| Mayor McKenzie is a co-sponsor of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| Miss Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| Oh, I'll get just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| I just want to go on record and say I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| with everything that's been said about the post office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| I believe it's an essential service and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| really do think we should support the postal service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| But I do I philosophically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| will don't want to support a resolution asking another elected body in Congress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| who represents the same people who represent the same people we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| to get into their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| I felt this way on the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| I voted for the the resolution two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| did Tennessee because the funds have already it's a program that already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| But philosophically, I think we've got enough to work on in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| And I just so I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| I will talk to our senators myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| personally and I will talk to our congressmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| But I just don't want to see the city get in the habit of sending resolutions to other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4471)|
| 1:14:37| elected bodies about lots of things when we have so much to work on ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| So please understand, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| I agree with the sentiment and I will do everything in my power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| I just am not going to support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| loose resolution for the reasons I stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| Thank you, Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Well, as a constituent of this federal body that we're talking to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| I would like to co-sponsor this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| I would have done it earlier, but the email went to my spam folder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| OK, let the record reflect that Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| Singh would like to co-sponsor this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| Any other questions, comments, Councilwoman Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| I just want to say, first of all, thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| Fields, for your service and and for what you do for the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| Postal Service and similar to I'm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| you know, I'm certainly I'm not familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| enough with what the U.S. Postal Service may or may not need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| And, you know, and understand the financial commitment of twenty five billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4540)|
| 1:15:46| You know, I plan to abstain on this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| But at the same time, I would like to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| you and what you do and in recognizing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4556)|

| 1:20:28| And so providing housing assistance to these agencies is a new program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4828)|
| 1:20:34| For the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4834)|

| 1:21:11| It's a little hard to see with the sun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| Yes, I'm kind of following what Councilman Parker was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| I'm very familiar with the work that Compassionate Coalition does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| They do a lot of good work, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| the public services and the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| assistance, is that part of a new program with Knoxville Leadership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| I guess I'm asking Knoxville Leadership if there's anybody here to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| I saw Chris Martin on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4896)|

| 1:21:47| Good evening, folks. Thanks for allowing us to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| Yes, Knoxville Leadership Foundation's a 26 year plus organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| We've been around doing affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| in partnership with the city for the better part of 15 to 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4918)|
| 1:22:04| The Compassion Coalition is an initiative underneath the umbrella of KLF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| Compassion Coalition has been in existence for 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| and recently in the last two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| was merged underneath KLF as one of our initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| Their program has been involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| working with churches in the community for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| They have a call center called the Connection Call Center that addresses all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| kinds of needs in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| We've been doing that for probably the better part of 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| That call center gets well over fifteen hundred to two thousand calls a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| for all kinds of emergency assistance from helping single women with children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| in housing, to housing assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| food assistance, all kinds of emergency assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| So we have a team of volunteers that man that call center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| We work in partnership with CAC and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| 211 and all the different agencies in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| It's a very well formed program, very experienced program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| And so this is not necessarily a new program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| It's a new pot of funds for the Compassion Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| We've already been given out housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| assistance and rental assistance for the last two months, especially in the midst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| of all of this. So it just provides us with more in revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| source to serve more citizens in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| Latham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| So the rental assistance, that is a new part of your program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5024)|
| 1:23:51| That's that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| We don't have rental assistance and utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| assistance for, like I said, as ongoing for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| And how do people qualify for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| I mean, not the specifics, just generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| For this particular source of funds, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| let Becky handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| But it's the CDBG funding which comes from HUD, has requirements associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5050)|
| 1:24:17| KLF's been managing CDBG funds for probably close to 15 years, if not more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| We're well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| well at birth of handling those funds and government funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| KLF's organization is about a six, seven million dollar a year operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| We manage a lot of federal funds as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| as city, local government funds and state funds as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| So we're we're very well equipped and resourced to manage funds like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5077)|
| 1:24:44| It's just providing a different source of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| funding to get in the hands of more people that need it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5086)|
| 1:24:52| And my last concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| Complicated or a difficult subject to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| about, but I know that the whole umbrella under Knoxville leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| there's it's very much Christ centered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| which is fine, but in keeping state and religion separate, it's not in the mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5108)|
| 1:25:15| statement that it is a Christian organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| I just want to make sure that there are no requirements for anybody to be of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5119)|
| 1:25:26| Religion, in order to get any services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| from you or to ever be made to feel uncomfortable there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| Like I said, we manage federal funds and for 20 years, we're a faith based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5133)|
| 1:25:40| organization, I can go back into the history of how faith based organizations got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| Eligibility, which they were discriminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| for years on because the federal government and government would not allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| faith based organizations to get funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| We do not discriminate on any race or any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| ethnicity or sex or religion or service of the people that come into the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5159)|
| 1:26:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| Councilman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| This is kind of Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| Martin, I know we're looking at four different resolutions and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| this way you can you can best answer this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| But between the four resolutions, 11B through 11E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| we're looking at all of those allocations of funds to potentially serve 710 households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5190)|
| 1:26:39| My question is, is there any kind of central communication between all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| agencies to determine who's applying and that we are, in fact, allocating these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5203)|
| 1:26:49| funds to 710 unique households versus any duplication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5209)|
| 1:26:56| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| We've been working on this communication between the agencies as well as how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5217)|
| 1:27:04| roll this out to the public to communicate effectively about where where someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| would need to go, what agency to call in order to get services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| Each agency is serving a slightly different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| population, so we are proposing to start through two one one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| And they will do just a very basic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| screening about whether a household is elderly, whether they have children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| whether they're single, and then direct them to the proper agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| where they can apply for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| Our department tracks everything that is done with federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| We will require monthly reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| and we will track every household that gets served through this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| OK, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| Yeah, I did see that some do you have a little different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| name? There were some duplications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| So I just wanted to get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| Thank you very much. You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| Ms. Gill, did you want to add on to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| I just wanted to really emphasize, Becky, and you made this point about two one one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| but, you know, this is a city program and the advertising and the marketing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| that community development has developed is really with common branding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| and a consistency of message so that there's not confusion about who to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| The message is always call two one one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| This is how you access these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| And it'll be the two one one support staff in our three one one call center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| as you know, with Russ, who will then help triage and get folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| into the right service agency to actually connect with that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| Thank you. Any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5328)|

| 1:31:47| Roberto, Councilwoman DiBerto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| And my question is for Becky Wade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| an email, I'm not sure who had a chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| pull together information around it, but I was a little concerned that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| pot of money, you know, all of the resolutions together went to rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5529)|
| 1:32:16| assistance and those perhaps on the verge of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5536)|
| 1:32:22| But no support for the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| getting our folks who are living the night on the street into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| So I sent Becky an email to help me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| understand maybe I've missed something in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| Is there a pot of money somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| To directly help our unhoused residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| Yeah. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| Ms. Parker, I apologize for for getting your email late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| I did respond, but it was right before council meeting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| So you will have new items coming to you at your next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| which are all the homeless service provider contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| So these these four contracts that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| here does not use all the COVID money that we've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| So the next batch of agreements will be coming to you at your next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| And all of those are homeless service contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| Is it a comparable amount of money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| It is not. It's it's not comparable, but because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| got far less in ESG than we did in CDBG CD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| we have to focus the ESG on the homeless services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| So that's that's what the group of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| contracts that you'll see next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| And I just wanted to say, you know, I brought this up because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| you know, previously ESG grants were for emergency shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| And then that program was changed to include support for folks on the verge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| of homelessness, and I would hate to see cities invest all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5644)|
| 1:34:10| of that money into rental assistance and then we're not investing as much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5650)|
| 1:34:16| directly into homeless support services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| I'm happy to hear there's more money coming to us to prove to go to to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5659)|
| 1:34:25| home, you know, to help in homelessness and not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| Well, thank you. Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| OK, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5674)|

| 1:35:52| Yes, I just want to check with legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| counsel and I just want to disclose that I do serve on the Legacy Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5755)|

| 1:36:06| Therefore, there is no conflict and I do plan to vote on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| Any questions, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| Miss Parker, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| I had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| comment sent in to me from the community about this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5778)|
| 1:36:24| And according to them, this property has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| been renovated at least twice in in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| And so there are questions about what the five hundred thousand would go towards for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| the rehabilitation way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| OK, yeah, I can't speak to the renovation in years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5802)|
| 1:36:47| I know that LHP is purchasing this property as applied for low income housing tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5807)|
| 1:36:53| credits to renovate the entire development of seventy one units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| And our funding is going to renovate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| partially renovate twenty five of those units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| And so our home federal home funds are tied to those twenty five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| But the entire development will remain affordable for an additional 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| It does have a federal HUD housing assistance contract on it so that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5835)|
| 1:37:22| the tenants that live there pay 30 percent of their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| And the HUD contract pays the difference between the rent and the tenant portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5846)|
| 1:37:36| And then do I understand it correctly that they have 40 years to pay off the loan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5856)|
| 1:37:42| They will pay the loan off at the end of 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| So the plan is to is to have it affordable for another 20 and then re up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5866)|
| 1:37:53| affordability period for another 20 years and then after 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| the city will get that home money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| And if they don't re up, would they have to pay it off after 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5882)|
| 1:38:11| Possibly, that's not part of what our discussions have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5891)|
| 1:38:17| Typically, with our housing rehab program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| we forgive this loan, we forgive those loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| as long as they are kept affordable during the affordability period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| But because of the financial structure of this deal, they needed to have this shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| as a true loan that they will pay back after 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| I won't be at the city then, so somebody else will have to collect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| Yeah, I get that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| Any other questions on item 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| No, Vice Mayor McKenzie, if you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| Yeah, I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| Yeah, I just want to say that this company has been a very responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| partner in the affordable housing industry for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| And so I am quite certain without a shadow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| of a doubt that we will recoup our funds for this programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| Thank you, Vice Mayor. Miss Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| I just I look through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| I don't think Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5966)|
| 1:39:26| Nance is on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| To comment on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| he did call and speak to me about this because it was in the fourth district and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| Miss Wade, I don't I'm looking, but I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| like some of the renovations that he discussed with me maybe are for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| for accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| But there was no discussion of past renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| It is it is newly coming into their ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| That's that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| They they don't own this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| They're purchasing it and rehabilitating the entire development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| All 71 units, all 71 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| Yes. And all 71 units will remain affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6009)|

| 1:46:24| seconded by Councilwoman Huguette in the session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| That's just Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| Is this different than the linear park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| Let me jump in there, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| So this is actually the study for four James White Parkway from the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| that is at the dead end to the edge of the bridge at the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| So this is about the linear park and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| reconnecting all those neighborhoods that were cut in half by the large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| controlled access projects, Mrs. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6414)|
| 1:47:01| Miss Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| Thank you. This is probably for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| Brace also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| This is part of the ten million dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| projects that we approved a while ago and within the 1920 budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6430)|
| 1:47:16| No, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| So the ten million dollars was dedicated to infrastructure improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| and the park amenities at the end of James White Parkway, where the property had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6442)|
| 1:47:28| purchased by the state, but when the project was no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| continued, the state transferred conveyed that property to the city and fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| And we've developed that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| And so that ten million dollars is for the end of the parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| This is actually an 80 20 match with Tita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| We we pay 20 percent of this ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| And it's about studying from the edge of the bridge to the terminus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| that space and how we accommodate vehicles, pedestrians, walk, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| walkers, bikers, park spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| How do we reconnect those neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| and those side streets that were literally literally cut right in half back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| when that large project happened many years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| And so it's about reconnectivity and about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| a linear park, as Parker described earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| OK, but it was something it's still within the 1920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| Your budget, the last year's budget, not this year's coming up in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| Yes, it's it's yes, it's in the current current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| Yes, ma'am. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| Yeah, thank you, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| Thank you, Mr. Grayson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| Mr. Parker, I just had one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| stress the importance of a wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| and very inclusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| public input process around this, because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| you know, those who use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| James Parkway to reach other parts of town are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6536)|
| 1:49:01| deep within South Knoxville to to right beside the bridge, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| it expands South Knoxville and it includes folks traveling from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6546)|
| 1:49:11| other parts of Knoxville to visit South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| And so it's almost like a city discussion needs to take place around that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6554)|
| 1:49:19| So I just encourage a really, really broad public participation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| And I think if you've not met Rebecca| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| Jane Montgomery and the staff and engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| we will have ongoing and continued dialogue with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| both South Knoxville and the broader community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| And I think we can fit all of those needs in that large space and accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6575)|
| 1:49:40| lots of different modes of transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| and still allow it to be the connector into South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6583)|
| 1:49:46| So absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| And I will say I am excited and I've heard other people excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| But I'm also worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| Oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6595)|

| 1:56:13| could this be something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| the police department also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| confirms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6980)|

| 1:56:27| our sentiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6987)|

| 1:56:36| I just want to echo what Councilwoman Singh is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| and also say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| that I've been working with community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| members on some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| reforms that we would like to see in the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7008)|
| 1:56:54| If we look at some of our policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| sometimes we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| remove the possibility of some of these situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| by, you know, limiting the discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| that our officers have in certain situations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| giving them more guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| And so I don't have all of those policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| reform recommendations here, but I know that they'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| coming forth before Council soon, and I hope that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| will consider them and some of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| of course, will will be just for the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| office because we don't have the purview over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| Thank you, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7050)|
| 1:57:31| I just want to add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| I support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7055)|
| 1:57:36| I know it's a council's resolution, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| it's got really important sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| And I do want to translate those sentiments into action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| I've been meeting with community groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| that's already started with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7070)|

| 1:57:56| But also, as I mentioned during my opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| remarks, I'm meeting with another group next week of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7079)|

| 1:58:12| her colleague, Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| What was her name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| Allison Rose Dush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7097)|
| 1:58:21| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| That was a good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7104)|
| 1:58:25| So so what I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| so I guess I just want to say these are good conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| and I do want to move from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| words to actions and that'll be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| I'll listen to council members and community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| members about and also something that I will be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| for someone new in the executive director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| role for Park to be able to help lead these discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| and also move forward with actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| that improve everything about law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7131)|

| 1:58:59| members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7139)|
| 1:59:00| But I know there's always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7140)|

| 1:59:09| I think there's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| some some education required for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| the community this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7156)|

| 1:59:23| different situations where the police have been called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7163)|

| 1:59:28| They thought if they called the police that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| that would be the arbitrator and tell them to go to their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| separate corners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| And I said, no, somebody is going to get arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| The police were called when a child had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| left about five or six had left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| his house and was just in the front yard rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| than a neighbor approaching and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| here, let's get you back in your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| They called the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| This is when a social worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| would be a much better option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| So it's not just when the police get pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| into these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| So I think we need some education on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| what their role is and isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| And that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| The large divide I talked earlier about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| how for some people, the police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| they see them as a protective force and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| for other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| You don't call the police ever because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7221)|
| 2:00:24| that you're going to end up being it's just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| the Central Park case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| One person knew who would be their advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| The other person knew who she was weaponizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| as for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| That separation is where the problem lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| That experience that two or three different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| sets of people have with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| And there are no quick answers to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| But that's where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| We have to somehow bring it together where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| it's the same experience for everybody and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| I hear you and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| Thank you, Mayor. And I want to thank Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| Mayor McKenzie for offering this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| emergency measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| I was very glad to sponsor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| join my colleagues in sponsoring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| So I just wanted to say I appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| this being brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| Also wanted to say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| council members saying I hear what you're saying about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| you know, we need to have this be more than just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| you know, here's our here's our feelings about this, which I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| is important, but some action as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| One thing I was thinking is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| in our class, we had some training that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7302)|
| 2:01:45| went to the police training and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| I'm not sure the new class had done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| And I was wondering if maybe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| having a session of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| about communication, like community communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| de-escalation tactics, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7319)|
| 2:02:02| that might be something we could all do to experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| And I was just going to mention that to you to see if you thought that would be a good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| maybe even small first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| in taking some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| I think that's a wonderful idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| I know for myself, it put me in their shoes for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7336)|
| 2:02:20| And then, you know, racism is not a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| You have and go, OK, stop it. It's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| It's a process that continues for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| because so many people have been raised with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| But I think that would be a good step in kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| meeting each other, different groups meeting each other that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| may not really they have hostilities or fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7358)|
| 2:02:43| I think that's a good idea. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| Councilwoman Hugo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| I just have a question for my colleague, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| Roberto. What class are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| The class of news council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| because COVID meant we couldn't do ride alongs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| and have this conversation with the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| And I know that's part of what we all intend to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| I'm just is I'm just wondering what class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| or was that a leadership Knoxville class or a larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| community conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7391)|
| 2:03:16| I apologize for the confusing language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7396)|
| 2:03:20| Yeah, I was meeting the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| of the twenty seventeen elected class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| on council as I guess what I was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| Yeah. And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| You know, we were dealing with the COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| situation right now. So it's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| But, you know, and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| maybe there is an opportunity for us to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| you know, so we'll be able to physically distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| and experience some of that classroom because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7422)|
| 2:03:45| it was it was a really that for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| members that went, I think it was a really good experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| But this one would be a little different in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| And we'd be asking about, you know, communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| methods with the community and and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| we're dealing with de-escalation and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| And I don't know if Chief Thomas wants to jump in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| on that and talk about it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| I was just going to say, I mean, I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| with everything my colleagues have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7448)|
| 2:04:09| I'm glad to see everybody co-sponsored this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| I think that's a very strong statement to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| And I agree with Councilwoman Singh and Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| Parker that actions speak louder than words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7459)|
| 2:04:22| And I think what I'm hearing is that we're all committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7462)|
| 2:04:26| But we don't have any concrete things right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| So I think this is a great start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| to show the community that we are a unified city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| in dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| And then we just have to walk the walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7476)|
| 2:04:40| I would just add that first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| Charles Lomax, the director of Community Empowerment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| is going to be issuing a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| on these issues tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| And he's here if we have any questions for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| Chief Thomas is, of course, also in the Zoom meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| She and I have already discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| And she and KPD are more than willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| offer some kind of training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| or or course or seminar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| And obviously consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7504)|
| 2:05:08| needs to do social distancing and masks and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| And we can try to schedule that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| And then, you know, because then once we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| all know how they currently define| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| use of force, what's excessive, what's considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| appropriate, then we you know, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| then how that's communicated and monitored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| at the police force and what happens when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| someone, you know, violates the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| What if the policy is right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| But then there's violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| Then what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| Those are questions I'm sure, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| Chief Thomas could answer right now, but probably deserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7539)|
| 2:05:42| their own separate, more extensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| discussion and Chief Thomas, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| if you could work with Vice Mayor McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7547)|
| 2:05:50| and maybe get something planned for council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| then that can inform some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| discussion and plans moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| including with the park director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| Maybe we can time it for when that person is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| place so it can be something that we do as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| Councilwoman Parker, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7567)|
| 2:06:10| Yeah, I just wanted to give a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| examples, even just from the weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| that we could, you know, discuss as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| I had friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7580)|
| 2:06:23| you know, who were out in the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| serving in the role as medic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| trying to help keep folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7589)|
| 2:06:32| who are out demonstrating safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7592)|
| 2:06:36| On Sunday, 10 folks got arrested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| for disorderly conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| In my professional career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| that has been a charge that we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| used quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| often inappropriately, both in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| and in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| And it quite often affects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| the black community disproportionately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| So it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| one reform is when you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| a police force that's dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| to actual, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| arrest based on an actual crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| Were they vandalizing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| Did they try to incite a riot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| But when you have such wide discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| under this term, really conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7639)|
| 2:07:24| there can be room for abuse within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7644)|
| 2:07:29| Also, I had folks report to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| in their interaction with police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| one person's shoulder was dislocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| One person was slammed to the ground so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| hard that they began to seizure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| and had to be taken to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| So these are all things that just happened in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| four days here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7667)|
| 2:07:50| And so it would be good to have a conversation about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| those use of force policies so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| we can have some input on whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| we think that these are appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| actions by our police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| I would just I would just say those things allegedly happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7682)|
| 2:08:06| You know, I mean, I know you said they were reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| to me as reported to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| That's a fair way to put it reported to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| I have I have different accounts from police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| officers who are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| I don't I wasn't there myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7698)|
| 2:08:20| It's a good reason we're moving forward with body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| So any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7705)|

| 2:08:49| more of the officers of these conversations out in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| There's nothing to hide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7733)|
| 2:08:54| We should all talk to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7734)|

| 2:12:18| service protections afforded by the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7938)|
| 2:12:21| As you know, reestablishing the HR department has been something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| multiple city administrations have grappled with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| starting with Mayor Haslam and continuing through Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7946)|
| 2:12:29| Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7949)|

| 2:12:32| specific edits made in response to suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7952)|
| 2:12:35| by council and employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| These include adding additional assurances that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7957)|
| 2:12:41| that all underlined and bolded that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| all charter based protections remain fully intact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| as well as requirements for noticing and allowing comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7967)|
| 2:12:50| on any proposed changes to administrative rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7970)|
| 2:12:53| governing classification and compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| I want to address a few specific concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| First, I just want to emphasize this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| I and my administration are 100 percent supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| of employee merit protections now and in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7985)|
| 2:13:08| The city charter clearly assures employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7988)|
| 2:13:11| of merit based hiring, promotion and disciplinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| And the proposed ordinance does not change the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| or any of these protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| We've heard concerns that the proposed change might lead to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| abusive power or other unfair disciplinary actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| These are valid concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| No employee wants to face that type of bad management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8007)|
| 2:13:31| Unfortunately, the reality is that such abuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| can occur and have occurred even under the current structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8013)|
| 2:13:37| Part of the role of HR is to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| that our managers across the city know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8020)|
