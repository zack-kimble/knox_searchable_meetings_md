| 1:58:43| We may want to clarify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| This is a draft of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| but we've already got a draft release| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| ready to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| so that we can make these appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| and we may want to give ourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| a little bit of flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| in the announcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| if we want to adjourn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| and then have the interviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| at, say, 7 o'clock or 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| so we don't have to have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| This meeting is going to go on a little late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| before we can get to the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| So I guess everybody, please promote this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| Let's get a great group of applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| Any other suggestions or comments on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| Just the next meeting of the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| will be November 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| and I would like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| that the application process is very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| We don't need a formal resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| Write something with your community service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| your community interest in serving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| and that would be plenty for the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| Okay. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| I'm sorry. What was that, Bud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| Knox County employees are not eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| And Knox County employees are not eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| So I might look to the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| that's covering this meeting tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| to put a blurb to push this out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| Finally, the chair will entertain a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| for us to go into recess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| for us to take a quick break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| and then we will come back to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| Is there a motion for recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7199)|
| 2:00:04| Ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| All right. It's almost 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| We'll be back here at 7.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| All right. We are on recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| It's time to come back from our recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| My fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| we have two items remaining on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| one item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| both of which were formally added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| at tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| One is a discussion related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| to the moving of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| The second item is related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| to backyard poultry regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| I know that Mr. Jay was the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| who brought the school discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| and I mentioned right before the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| that we may want to move the lion's share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| of that to next week's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| next week's discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| so the chair recognizes Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| I am sending around a copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| of some information that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| any extras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| I think if you just give them to Drew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| if anybody else wants a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| I was away for a work trip last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| I'm sorry I was not able to be here in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| but I did watch on CTV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| and then I was able to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| and actually watch the meeting again in full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| and take all the documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| both provided by finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| and additional information from the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| and from PBA and other members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| that have sort of been part of this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| and I thought I'd just share,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| this is just my analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7287)|
| 2:01:29| of not only everything that was presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| but all the questions that everybody asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| here in commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| because I had a lot of those questions as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| so I went back and sort of asked more and more questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| so again, this is just giving you information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| that's sort of my analysis of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| Hopefully we'll have a more robust conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| but I wanted to just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| moving Knox County Schools out of the AJ building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| has been around for about 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| and the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| have really, really been spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| on a tremendous amount of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| to try to get us to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| and due diligence has been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| on so many different properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| I think up to 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| and so the results of everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| that has come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| is really the fruition of that work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| and the TVA Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| in everyone's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| was determined to be the best option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| with the best potential for long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| and expanded use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| and most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| I think it just needs to be said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| to the most benefit of the Knox County taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| and so I try to boil this down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| in just a way that is a little bit more simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| in that there's two scenarios that we can go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| One, take no action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| and just let the scale system be where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| which will require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| operating and maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| and some renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| and essentially if nothing is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| we're still going to end up investing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| financially and then end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| with no tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| and no redevelopment in downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| and no additional infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| and if we take an action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| which is being recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| and move to the TVA Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| the net benefit is massive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| It is $43 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| of private redevelopment investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| potential for $69 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| in local economic impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| and here's the biggest thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| just a baseline savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| of between $29 and $69 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| in addition to potential revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| from so many different sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7401)|
| 2:03:23| so I tried to sort of break down all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| I hope it's helpful to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| At the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| I really would like us to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| for us to not take additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| private tax revenue properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| and turn them into government properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| that do not generate any tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| Taking a government to government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| I think you asked this, Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| one government building to another government building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| makes a whole lot more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| The rates for revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7429)|
| 2:03:51| or for bonding are hysterically low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7431)|
| 2:03:54| and at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| make a smart decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| that is for the long-term benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| We could sit around forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| and obviously 10 years of conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| has finally led to a decision point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| but in business, you do your homework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| you do your due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| you consider all the options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| you make the best decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| and you move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| and I would just encourage you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| to talk more about it next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| and let's find a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| to save a lot of money for the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| make the best decision as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| and move the ball forward a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| instead of being here a decade later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| And I know we appreciate this analysis that you provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| and it's my intent to kind of move this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| to next week as an official discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| With that said, Mr. Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| Is there any way you could do an analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| of kind of some of the stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| that we talked about last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| about maybe pushing all the things into one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| after what we just heard tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| into spaces for heads in beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| and things of that nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| or a justice center or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| Is there any way you could do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| to see what the other six floors may hold for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| I guess what I might do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| is I'll look to the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| if they want to kind of create some analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| I was just looking through a little packet here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| I was just trying to, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| Perhaps we can talk more about that next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| and kind of dig into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| Yeah, I think, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| that would be very appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| and I'll just add one little quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| After doing this analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| I did go back to the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| here in Knox County and just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| are my numbers correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| I did go through it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| am I looking at this correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| So I have vetted this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| This is, again, just essentially repackaging it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| in a simpler form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| but I did verify that what's in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| is at least accurate from what I've deciphered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| Well, Madam Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| that concludes our discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| Okay, next item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| I believe I titled it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| Poultry Ordinance Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| And every now and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| these meetings do put me in a foul mood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| so this is a good time to call on Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| who brought this item to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7564)|
| 2:06:11| I had a constituent call me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| about chickens in their neighbor's backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| and I suggested they move them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| to the east tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7577)|
| 2:06:21| But seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| this person had called codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7584)|
| 2:06:27| had called animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| There is no regulation on backyard poultry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7589)|
| 2:06:32| and I would ask the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| to bring us anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| if there's any ordinances, any codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| I know there is an area where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| if it's agricultural land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| you can't regulate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| But I'm thinking perhaps in our residential zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7604)|
| 2:06:45| there is probably something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| we need to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| So I would like to move this to next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| after the law director has brought us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| any information he can find on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| Yeah, I think that would be the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| I know, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| when you mentioned this as a discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| our first point was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| according to the Tennessee Right to Farm Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| we can't regulate agricultural-related activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| on ag properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| But we've really gone deep down that hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| However, if we do have areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| when you're in areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| there are certain areas in county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| it's indistinguishable if you're in a county neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| or a city neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| They all look exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| And there may be something to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| if you're looking at a county area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| that's zoned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| that is not zoned ag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| that this might actually apply to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| And that's what I'm asking the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| to look into, to see if we can distinguish by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| Sometimes you can't do things by zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| And I want to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| before we start down any process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| that we are not stepping outside of our lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190916?start=7665)|
