| 2:31:21| By December 12th, with stories filled with more dead than alive, the death count has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9081)|
| 2:31:27| piled up past 18,405.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9087)|
| 2:31:32| I know you all are not bad people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| I'm not here to call you all communists or terrorists or whatever the hell people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9095)|
| 2:31:42| been calling each other names recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9102)|
| 2:31:45| But I did watch the city council meeting last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9105)|
| 2:31:49| And I wasn't expecting a yes, because I know it's complicated on a federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9109)|
| 2:31:56| But on a city level, that was a bunch of people who came in on both sides and screamed about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9116)|
| 2:32:02| their pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| These are people in our community who were hurt deeply by this exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9124)|
| 2:32:09| And the fact that they weren't even willing or worth the extra 10, 15 minutes to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9129)|
| 2:32:15| actually discuss why we can't say what we say, why we can't choose a side here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9135)|
| 2:32:24| You ignored it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9144)|
| 2:32:25| You said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| And then you talked about tranquilizing a bear for an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9147)|
| 2:32:31| And I'm sorry if that doesn't seem like what you intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9151)|
| 2:32:36| But you told every single person there, at least on the opposing side, that they didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9156)|
| 2:32:41| matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9161)|
| 2:32:42| And that the people that they were crying about were less than dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9162)|
| 2:32:48| And that ashamed me, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9168)|
| 2:32:50| Because I have traveled the world shouting about how amazing the South is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9170)|
| 2:32:56| I've been told I'm racist because I'm from Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| And I've told them, you don't know what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9179)|
| 2:33:02| People think I'm stupid because I'm from Tennessee and I'm from America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9182)|
| 2:33:06| And I'm really sick and tired of people thinking that we're unintelligent and that we're heartless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9186)|
| 2:33:11| and that we are evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9191)|
| 2:33:14| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9194)|
| 2:33:15| I can't speak on 1943 or the fact that our president was born before the modern day Israel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9195)|
| 2:33:21| was founded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| But I do know that Tennessee is a pro-life state, for better or for worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9203)|
| 2:33:29| And I, for one, think bombing babies is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9209)|
| 2:33:34| I didn't think my heart could break more after witnessing a man holding his child's body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9214)|
| 2:33:39| parts in plastic bags to the sky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9219)|
| 2:33:43| I didn't think it could hurt more that you could take 508 IVF shots and hold a dead baby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9223)|
| 2:33:48| in your hands that had been blown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| And I didn't think my heart could shatter anymore when I'm witnessing a father taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9231)|
| 2:33:56| his final selfie with his dead baby after the mass graves that we saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9236)|
| 2:34:04| So Knoxville, I don't ask you to pass a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9244)|
| 2:34:07| But I do ask that you help us from our Grinch-like hearts from scrinching two sizes too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9247)|
| 2:34:14| And just remember, like, love is love and love is for us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9254)|
| 2:34:20| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9260)|
| 2:34:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9261)|

| 2:34:43| I've not been here in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9283)|
| 2:34:46| That's because a lot of good has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9286)|
| 2:34:49| And when you're doing what we send you to represent us to do, we don't have to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9289)|
| 2:34:55| But for now, I have returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9295)|
| 2:34:59| You spoke of priorities in this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9299)|
| 2:35:04| Winter is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9304)|
| 2:35:05| You spoke of thriving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9305)|
| 2:35:06| But there are some who are not going to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9306)|
| 2:35:09| Yesterday, an elderly man sat in his wheelchair on Broadway in the cold by himself in a wheelchair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9309)|
| 2:35:22| The calls went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9322)|
| 2:35:23| What do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| Do we call the police?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9325)|
| 2:35:26| The police didn't come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9326)|
| 2:35:27| Do we call the crisis intervention team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9329)|
| 2:35:30| Can we take him to the hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9332)|
| 2:35:33| There's nothing wrong with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9333)|
| 2:35:34| There is a gap, a serious gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| The lady who saw him didn't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9337)|
| 2:35:40| How could she help him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| There was no help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9342)|
| 2:35:43| CARM closes at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9343)|
| 2:35:44| You can't come into CARM after 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9344)|
| 2:35:48| There's a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9348)|
| 2:35:49| I know there's warming centers coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9349)|
| 2:35:52| Remember last year when it was 4 degrees and 6 degrees and the only two places that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9352)|
| 2:35:55| would open up would be Magnolia United Methodist Church and the fig tree at Cokesbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| It's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9360)|
| 2:36:01| There is a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| How do we get our most vulnerable to the places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9363)|
| 2:36:09| Winter is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| I keep hearing about the millions that are coming into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9371)|
| 2:36:15| I keep hearing about there's $41 million in our general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| But we can't seem to help our most vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9379)|
| 2:36:23| We can't seem to sit down and make a decision that we are going to move some of these millions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9383)|
| 2:36:28| around and help our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9388)|
| 2:36:32| We've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9392)|
| 2:36:34| Winter is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9394)|
| 2:36:36| We need funds right now to help our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| We need to take the vans and the trucks and all the things that we've got now and we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9399)|
| 2:36:43| to move them around the city when it's cold, when it's 28 degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9403)|
| 2:36:47| Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9407)|
| 2:36:48| Look at that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9408)|
| 2:36:49| The word says he left the 99 and he went for the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9409)|
| 2:36:53| The one is our elder, the one are our vulnerable that are on this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9413)|
| 2:36:58| And it's time for us to stop and to really do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9418)|
| 2:37:02| Now we need to spend what's in our wallets now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9422)|
| 2:37:07| If we just took one of those $41 million in general fund, do you know what we could do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9427)|
| 2:37:12| Do you know what we could accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9432)|
| 2:37:15| Do you know how many lives we could save?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9435)|
| 2:37:17| I say that because Thursday of next week, December 21st, is the winter solstice, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9437)|
| 2:37:23| shortest day of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9443)|
| 2:37:24| It's the day that we go right across from VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9444)|
| 2:37:26| We remember those who died on the street, many who have no names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9446)|
| 2:37:33| How much shorter would that list be if we would really stop and help all of our people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9453)|
| 2:37:39| If we would really care about every single person, not just everybody we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9459)|
| 2:37:42| move here, not just all the millions we're putting in for the stadium, but the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9462)|
| 2:37:46| who live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9466)|
| 2:37:47| I heard it said in the prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| We must remember that our responsibility is to all the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9470)|
| 2:37:55| That was the prayer, including the vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9475)|
| 2:37:59| So I stand here for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9479)|
| 2:38:01| You've done a good job, but it's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9481)|
| 2:38:04| It's time as we get ready to go into 2024, don't wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9484)|
| 2:38:09| Right now is when you go in that pocketbook and you get something done and you come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9489)|
| 2:38:13| and you say, this is what we're going to do when the temperature drops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9493)|
| 2:38:16| We're going to go get our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9496)|
| 2:38:18| Don't just take care of all that's coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9498)|
| 2:38:20| Take care of the ones that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9500)|

| 2:39:36| B and E. B and E means breaking and entering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9576)|

| 2:40:08| The city stole my father's store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9608)|
| 2:40:11| My father was a Palestinian immigrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9611)|
| 2:40:12| He came here in 1953.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9612)|
| 2:40:15| And I asked him around 1980 when I was young, did he like Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9615)|
| 2:40:19| He said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9619)|
| 2:40:22| And I watched him come over here to beg so the city would not take his store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9622)|
| 2:40:29| The store caught fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| The store had a small bomb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| And I can prove it if this city kept the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9633)|
| 2:40:37| I can prove it was a bomb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9637)|
| 2:40:38| It was more than just a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| And again, it's the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9641)|
| 2:40:44| Mr. Stan Sharp, I'm sure he went to his job innocently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9644)|
| 2:40:52| But this is what Knoxville does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9652)|
| 2:40:55| This is exactly what Knoxville does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9655)|
| 2:40:57| Just like that lady said about the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9657)|
| 2:41:00| It's something simple to unite us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| But how can we be united when the city is burning Palestinian stores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9663)|
| 2:41:08| They burned those two stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9668)|
| 2:41:10| They burned the clinic, the Planned Parenthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9670)|
| 2:41:14| You people, you got my phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9674)|
| 2:41:16| I'll show you what I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9676)|
| 2:41:18| And I bet you right now the fire department still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9678)|
| 2:41:20| refuses to let go of the pictures of Planned Parenthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9680)|
| 2:41:25| Parkway Hotel, and you're going to think I'm crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9685)|
| 2:41:30| Christopher Newsom and Shan Christian, it is possible that it's a lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9690)|
| 2:41:37| I know we had courtrooms and proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9697)|
| 2:41:41| But I found at least one picture manipulated during the courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9701)|
| 2:41:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9707)|
| 2:41:48| Anybody's interested, you've got my phone number, 865-335-4824.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9708)|
| 2:41:56| It's a crazy accusation when you see people griefing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9716)|
| 2:42:00| during the courtroom in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9720)|
| 2:42:03| But there's pictures manipulated, just like with the Bilo store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9723)|
| 2:42:08| That like that lady said, you could have voted for a cease fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9728)|
| 2:42:14| Washington, DC is Washington, DC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9734)|
| 2:42:18| They're going to do what they want to do, no matter what we say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9738)|
| 2:42:23| No matter what we say, that's exactly what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9743)|
| 2:42:27| But as a human being, it's not too much to say or to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9747)|
| 2:42:34| and pass a resolution Ms. Parker introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9754)|
| 2:42:39| It's not too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| And once in the Bilo store, it's an injustice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9761)|
| 2:42:46| to keep blaming a black man for burning the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9766)|
| 2:42:49| India McDowell, India Gourley, to confuse the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9769)|
| 2:42:54| Nobody burned that store but the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9774)|
| 2:42:57| You've got my phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9777)|
| 2:42:59| And my name is John Zieta, Hilaire John Zieta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9779)|
| 2:43:04| And I'll back up everything I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9784)|
| 2:43:07| And the mayor knows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9787)|
| 2:43:09| And God bless the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9789)|
| 2:43:12| Who would know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| Who would ever think when an alarm goes off for these business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9794)|
| 2:43:18| in the middle of the night, the alarm triggers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9798)|
| 2:43:24| it goes to the police department, the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| You've got to be careful if it doesn't go to Daryl Whitaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9807)|
| 2:43:32| the arson investigator, which Daryl Whitaker is not there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| no more, but apparently that's how they work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| the arson investigators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9818)|
| 2:43:40| I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9820)|
| 2:43:41| If anybody thinks I'm crazy, my phone number is 865-335-4824.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9821)|
| 2:43:49| And I'll show you how crazy I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9829)|
| 2:43:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9831)|
| 2:43:54| Thank you, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9834)|
| 2:43:55| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| Vice Mayor Roberto, before we adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9838)|
| 2:44:02| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| I had noticed that former city council member Ed Schaus is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9844)|
| 2:44:09| And so I wanted to recognize our former city council members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9849)|
| 2:44:13| Also, he was a county commissioner and our Knox County trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9853)|
| 2:44:18| So I don't think I missed any of the offices that you held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9858)|
| 2:44:21| But if I did, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9861)|
| 2:44:25| Tonight is the last meeting for one of our council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9865)|
| 2:44:30| And so I just wanted to take a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9870)|
| 2:44:33| and maybe give her a few minutes to say a few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9873)|
| 2:44:37| if she wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9877)|
| 2:44:39| And Mr. Johnson is getting something for me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9879)|
| 2:44:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9883)|
| 2:44:49| And Ms. Testerman, council member Testerman, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9889)|
| 2:44:53| let's go to the center of the aisle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9893)|
| 2:45:06| I think it's a, come on up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9906)|
| 2:45:12| You get to stand up here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9912)|
| 2:45:13| And we're going to do a duet in a minute, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9913)|
| 2:45:19| This is, it's an honor to sit up in these seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9919)|
| 2:45:24| for the limited time that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9924)|
| 2:45:27| And I think anyone who ends up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9927)|
| 2:45:30| can you help me hold this because it's getting heavy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9930)|
| 2:45:35| Anyone who wants to sit up here and who ends up sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9935)|
| 2:45:41| I think, has a goal of having our city be a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9941)|
| 2:45:46| And each of us might come with different perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9946)|
| 2:45:49| on what that might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9949)|
| 2:45:51| But that's what we're working towards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9951)|
| 2:45:52| which I think is a wonderful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9952)|
| 2:45:54| And I just want to thank council member Testerman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9954)|
| 2:45:58| for your time here serving with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9958)|
| 2:46:01| And I know I mentioned it at the end of beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| but you got the chance to serve as beer board chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9963)|
| 2:46:07| And I found, and I think all of council found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9967)|
| 2:46:12| that your leadership on beer board was so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9972)|
| 2:46:15| And we really appreciate what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| And just thinking about what was done for the remedial plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9977)|
| 2:46:21| and the fines to help prevent underage service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9981)|
| 2:46:24| I think is really commendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9984)|
| 2:46:26| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| I also just want to recognize that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9988)|
| 2:46:31| saw a lot of change and improvement with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9991)|
| 2:46:35| to the care of animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9995)|
| 2:46:36| And I know that you were behind a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| And so thank you for all that you have been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| But I just wanted to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| And council wanted to present you with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| And you can see your name plate is there for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10006)|
| 2:46:50| to remember your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10010)|
| 2:46:51| And we know that this chapter might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10011)|
| 2:46:55| be closing with your service on council right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10015)|
| 2:46:57| But we know that just like before you served on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10017)|
| 2:47:00| after council, you'll continue to serve our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| And I just wanted to give you a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10023)|
| 2:47:04| to say anything if you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| But from all of us, thank you so much for being here with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10026)|
| 2:47:11| and serving your city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10031)|
| 2:47:17| Well, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10037)|
| 2:47:19| It's kind of awkward being right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10039)|
| 2:47:23| But as I said earlier, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10043)|
| 2:47:26| thank you, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10046)|

| 2:47:45| And I think the common ground we all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10065)|
| 2:47:49| is that we love the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| We want what's best for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10071)|

| 2:48:02| and trying to create the best version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10082)|
| 2:48:05| that we can for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10085)|
| 2:48:08| I'm at a crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10088)|
| 2:48:09| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10089)|
| 2:48:10| I know that I want to continue doing what I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10090)|
| 2:48:15| And as I've said, and as the mayor and I met today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10095)|
| 2:48:22| for me, I just encourage everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10102)|
| 2:48:24| to be bridge builders, be conveners, work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10104)|
| 2:48:30| because that's really how we get things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10110)|
| 2:48:33| So with that, it's hard to believe four years has flown by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10113)|
| 2:48:38| But again, this is special and very meaningful to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10118)|
| 2:48:43| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10123)|

| 2:49:40| to thank you for all that you've done for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10180)|
| 2:49:43| in the city and for the dedication you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10183)|
| 2:49:46| had for the city for that length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10186)|
| 2:49:49| And we wanted to give you a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10189)|
| 2:49:51| if you had anything you wanted to say, to say it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10191)|
| 2:49:53| But we just wanted to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10193)|
| 2:49:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10196)|
| 2:50:02| First of all, I want to say it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10202)|
| 2:50:04| an honor and a privilege for me to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10204)|
| 2:50:06| the citizens of Knoxville in this particular way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10206)|
| 2:50:10| as city judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10210)|
| 2:50:12| It's been a privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10212)|
| 2:50:15| I cannot tell you how much I appreciate the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10215)|
| 2:50:17| to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10217)|
| 2:50:18| I have lots of people I'd like to thank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10218)|
| 2:50:19| if you'll give me permission to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10219)|
| 2:50:22| I can stand here and probably talk all night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10222)|
| 2:50:24| because as you all well know, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10224)|
| 2:50:27| you run for public office and you're in public life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| you meet lots of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10229)|
| 2:50:30| But I have to tell you, when you run for public office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| it forces you to get out and meet people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10233)|
| 2:50:35| And I cannot begin to tell you how many wonderful people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10235)|
| 2:50:39| that I have met over the years that I would never have met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10239)|
| 2:50:44| never, ever, when I've come in contact, probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10244)|
| 2:50:46| with any of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10246)|
| 2:50:49| And people in charities, people involved in politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10249)|
| 2:50:52| people in neighborhood meetings, so many wonderful people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10252)|
| 2:50:57| that I would never meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10257)|
| 2:50:58| And I'm so grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10258)|
| 2:50:59| And I do want to ask somebody to say this about my most thrilling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10259)|
| 2:51:09| moment as being the city judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10269)|
| 2:51:12| I guess I have several thrilling moments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10272)|
| 2:51:13| but the thing that always I'll never forget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10273)|
| 2:51:16| is the privilege and the honor that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10276)|
| 2:51:18| had to swear in police officer classes, fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10278)|
| 2:51:22| classes, city council members, other officers and other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10282)|
| 2:51:28| that have taken oaths of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10288)|
| 2:51:31| You stand there, and I've had the privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| of taking the oath myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10293)|
| 2:51:34| I've had the privilege of giving the oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10294)|
| 2:51:37| You stand there and you say, you promised uphold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10297)|
| 2:51:39| the Constitution of the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10299)|
| 2:51:42| the Constitution of the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10302)|
| 2:51:44| the laws and ordinances of the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10304)|
| 2:51:47| and of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10307)|
| 2:51:50| That, to me, is probably the most meaningful thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| that I have had the privilege to do for myself and for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10312)|
| 2:51:57| of you who are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| But I said I wanted to thank some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10320)|
| 2:52:03| First of all, I want to thank Valerie Coleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10323)|
| 2:52:05| I think she's here somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10325)|

| 2:52:14| what this woman means to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10334)|

| 2:52:21| went to work for civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10341)|
| 2:52:23| And then the office came open, and I asked her to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10343)|
| 2:52:27| She is the most wonderful, capable, efficient, honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10347)|
| 2:52:31| straightforward person that could have ever hold that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10351)|
| 2:52:34| I'm so thankful that I had the privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10354)|

| 2:52:59| and the staff of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10379)|

| 2:53:19| Been privileged to work with the fire department, the codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10399)|
| 2:53:21| enforcement officers, the animal enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10401)|
| 2:53:24| I understand they're getting ready to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10404)|
| 2:53:27| Um, but having said all that, um, my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10407)|

| 2:54:01| I want to thank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10441)|
| 2:54:03| This all started in 1986 when I came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10443)|
| 2:54:06| when I applied for the job before this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10446)|
| 2:54:10| Alan Elliott, I don't know if any of you remember him or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=10450)|
