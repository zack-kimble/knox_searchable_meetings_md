| 0:07:30| Councilmember Thomas celebrated his birthday since our last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| so I want to take a moment and say happy birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=454)|

| 0:07:45| I found it particularly interesting that they were founded in 1915,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| and they're actually the oldest troop in the Great Smoky Mountain Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| and they've been meeting at Second Presbyterian Church for 107 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=477)|

| 0:08:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| As we pile on the love for Troop 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| I will just say that I'm the proud mother of two Eagle Scouts from Troop 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| and was there for the 100th anniversary, so been a longtime supporter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| As many of you know, I'm the chief executive of the Girl Scouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| and there's nothing better than scouting programs for our young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| so thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| On Sunday, the 17th, was Constitution Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| and we have Jenny Lee here from Blunt Mansion that has some things to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| about Blunt Mansion and Constitution Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=522)|
| 0:08:57| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| Thank you all for having me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| In the theme of spreading more love for Troop 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| I like to think that we're an Oxford staple because we're going on our 100th year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| as a museum, and they knocked us right out of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| But, yes, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| I'm Jennifer Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| I'm the director of development and public relations for the Blunt Mansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| We are the oldest operating museum in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| We preserve and protect the history of Blunt Mansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| all the way from William Blunt, who was a U.S. Constitution signer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| Blunt Mansion is regarded as the birthplace of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| It's the place where the Tennessee State Constitution was initially drafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| all the way to our founder almost 100 years ago, Mary Boyce Temple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| who worked as a suffragette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| So we have a very long, fulfilled 232, almost, years of history on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| And I had just a couple things that I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| On Constitution Day from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| we will be having Constitution Day programming not this Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| but the next Thursday on the 28th, led by Dr. Christopher Magra,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| talking about William Blunt, who was a Constitution signer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| but then also ends up being our first federal official to undergo impeachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| So it's a very roundabout tale of history that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| But on behalf of us, with the mansion, with Historic House Museums of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| and for the Arts and Culture Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| I wanted to make just a few statements on the impact that nonprofits have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| in Knox County and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| Blunt Mansion itself improves academic performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| by conducting civic, historical, and agricultural programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| and activities for children of all ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| In the last academic year, Blunt Mansion welcomed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| over 1,500 school-aged children for field trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| who learned about the founding of the U.S. and the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| civic responsibility, and proper horticulture practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| most of which are all a part of their core curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| and aids these students to better understand and retain information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| that is observable on their test scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| Blunt Mansion strengthens the local economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| by employing three, a mix of part-time and full-time staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| who in turn shopped and contributed to the city's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| and sales tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| In addition, last year Blunt Mansion attracted over 5,000 visitors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| from outside of the city of Knoxville to our site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| representing an economic boon of $475,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| to the city's business and government income streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| Blunt Mansion promotes individual well-being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| by regularly making 10-plus events free per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| It usually varies depending on how packed we can get our calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| For everyone, by being sure our heirloom gardens can be enjoyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| as a quiet oasis in the middle of a booming city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| In fact, over 7,500 people came to Blunt Mansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| for pure enjoyment last year in the mix of attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| and events that we put on each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Blunt Mansion enriches community life by participating in parades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| statehood day, and other special events that bring people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| from the community together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| By telling stories of the people of color who have lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| and worked on the grounds of Blunt Mansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| and by bringing their everyday lives to light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| for better understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| I would like to define cultural heritage tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| Cultural heritage tourism can be historical attractions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| monuments, landmarks, museums, art galleries, theaters, festivals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| concerts, performances, and significantly historical communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| or neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| The economic impact of Blunt Mansion and the arts and culture lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| all together is great to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| as it is across the entirety of the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| After reviewing a varying number of reports from across the past 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| I have found that studies show that almost 65 to 80% of U.S. tourists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| on average take part in some form of cultural heritage activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| while traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| But the majority of those tourists, roughly about 70%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| cited an event tied to cultural heritage tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| as the main reason for at least one trip that they made during that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| About 40% said they added extra time to at least one trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| to accommodate an activity that would be considered cultural heritage tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| Cultural heritage tourists also stay longer and spend more than other tourists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| who visit for a day trip for things like sporting events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| On average, cultural heritage tourists spend $623 versus $457.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| They use a hotel, motel, Airbnb 62% of the time versus $55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| They're more likely to spend over $1,000 on average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| which is about 19% versus $12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| And they travel longer, an average of 5.2 nights versus 3.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| So on behalf of Blunt Mansion, Historic House Museums of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| and the Arts and Culture Alliance, we function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| well, the Arts and Culture Alliance in general functions...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| Ma'am, your time's about up, so go ahead and wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| Okay, last one, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| This is an unpaid administrator of Knox County's contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| with 39 arts and culture organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| Additionally, numerous nonprofits in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| are also supported by the Community Agency Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| These grants are vital to the continued operations of these nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| and their programs, which in turn, for every dollar to the city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| invested in arts and culture, returns $32.80 in the value of contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| Thank you. Thank you so much. There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| Jenny, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| I wanted to call attention to the conversation that we had the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| that I really respected, that you guys are talking about the full history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| of Blunt Mansion and not shying away from that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| We do try to flesh it out in our interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| starting with the Blunt family leading all the way up to suffrage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| So we try to round out to over 200 years of history as well as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| to be inclusive to everyone who is on property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| Thank you, Council Member Singh. Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=865)|

| 0:14:38| It will start at 2 o'clock at Pellissippi's Hardin Valley Campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| Thank you. Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| I also want to thank the Boy Scouts and the troop for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| Actually, I was a Boy Scout one time, and I still have kept the Boy Scout handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| It still has a place on my shelf, and I refer to it from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| I'm a nature person, still enjoy camping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| and not only has it got some good practical advice on how to make it in the woods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| but it's got some good advice on just living in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| So I appreciate all you being here and continue to camp and enjoy nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| Thank you. Thank you for the council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| We'll move on to Item 8A, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| 8A is the resolution confirming the reappointment of Daniel Odle to speak as a member of the Board of Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| to serve as a member of the Board of Zoning Appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Council Members, there are two people who signed up to speak in favor of this reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| First is Hannah Freeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| Ms. Freeman, you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| Hi, my name is Hannah Freeman, 37912, formerly known as the Tanglewood Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| I'm here to talk about probably what is the elephant in the room today to most of you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| and I'd be grateful to elaborate on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| I am in favor of Daniel Odell for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| I got to speak to Odell earlier this week, really stand-up guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| He's a Vol, Vols help Vols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| I'm also a volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| He's also very readily against corporate greed, so all about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| He's extremely resourceful, managing multimillion-dollar accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| He's a very intelligent man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| So money hasn't necessarily gone to his head yet from our conversation we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| That was a really positive note I took from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| So really what we're here to talk about today is how important it is when we're appointing members to boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1001)|
| 0:16:48| like the appeals board, for instance, and having a discussion instead of it just being brought as an agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| and just voted on kind of willy-nilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| Really, we need conversation to stir about some really important things that we've been noticing in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| such as affordable housing and the availability and the lack thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| We need affordable housing, you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| We've been up here talking to you all about, you know, a little over a month now about the need that we've seen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| Rent's at an all-time high here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| We can't keep up with it, just frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Our low to moderate income workers, it's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| It's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Doubling someone's rent is crippling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| And this morning I was just at an eviction case for one of my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| When we said a month ago that we were going to see evictions, we're seeing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| We're finally seeing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| I know Nikki was here last city council meeting and let you know we're seeing them then, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| They're just going to continue rolling down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| The affordable housing complex that was proposed over in West Knoxville, of course, 56 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| Of course, Dominion Group withdrew that offer because there was a lot of protesting against affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| So what we wanted to do was show up here to show you that there's also people in support of affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1081)|
| 0:18:08| and show developers here that we are in support of affordable housing here in Knoxville, and please do not go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1088)|
| 0:18:15| The Tanglewood community alone had over 300 residents, 105 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| And all we're asking for really at this point is a fair negotiation with our property management company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| Other properties that the Rand owns in Knoxville got grandfathered into their rates gradually to reach fair market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1107)|
| 0:18:37| We weren't given that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| My rent alone was raised $515, and I can show you that if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| So we need help with this plea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| To help us survive this housing crisis, we must discuss broader area solutions for multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| and high-density residential complexes on when, where, and how they're going to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| We're 9,000 units short of solving a housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| 9,000 is a big number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| I don't think in units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| I think about the families that those 9,000 units represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| That's 15,000 people approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| That's single moms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| That's veterans who we're thanking today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| Glad the Boy Scouts can be here, you know, because, yeah, that's your nurses, your KPD officers we have in our complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1155)|
| 0:19:24| That's your students, like myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| That's a lot of people displaced in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| So in spirit of that togetherness, we have built within multiple RAND properties a growing unified voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1171)|
| 0:19:40| And our mission here is to advocate voice policy and ensure the betterment of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| Moreover, we believe that housing is a human right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| It's not a commodity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| And basic needs are morally neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| It's a black-and-white issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| That's why we're in black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| There's a right and a wrong to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| Let's get people in houses because houses are for need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| Not for beat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| The next person to sign up to speak to Item 8A is Nikki Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| You can start by saying your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1214)|
| 0:20:27| My name is Nikki Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| I am a resident of Tanglewood Apartments, or that was what it was formerly known as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1230)|
| 0:20:37| It's RAND at Tilbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| I'm here to speak on Agenda Item 8A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| Daniel Odle, I got to speak with him earlier this week, just like Hannah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| And it's clear that he's passionate about what he does and has a heart for this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| Like she said, he's a Vol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| He understands that the environmental and economic benefits of revitalizing blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| and the need for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| On the topic of affordable housing, I would like to ask everyone in this chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| who has ever rented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| Who has ever rented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Who has rented in the last five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| Who's rented in the last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| This right here is your constituent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| This is who is asking for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| Low-income housing and affordable housing for folks that have a dream of buying a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| but can't because their rent has been 100% increased and they can't save for a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1308)|
| 0:22:01| That is why my neighbors and I and my friends are overjoyed to announce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1321)|
| 0:22:09| Knoxville's first renters and tenants union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1329)|
| 0:22:20| We've named ourselves the Knox Area Tenants Union, or CATU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1340)|
| 0:22:29| CATU was not born out of a dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| It was born out of a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| A need for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| A need that's basic and unwaveringly morally neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1358)|
| 0:22:49| CATU has already supported our neighbors in so many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| From supplemental food for single parent moms, solidarity and eviction court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1374)|
| 0:23:02| care and case management, translation services during lease renewals, organizing community events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1382)|
| 0:23:11| reading mail, leases, lease renewals, and other documents for low vision residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1391)|
| 0:23:19| being a shoulder to cry on during unfair and immoral situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1399)|
| 0:23:27| and being there to celebrate when people have exciting things to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| Like they've been able to afford a home, a permanent home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| And we've been generally a great community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| But CATU doesn't stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| We are asking for this council to support us and our unified voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| We are asking for this council to keep affordable housing for all Knoxville's citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1434)|
| 0:24:02| We are asking for this council to consider things like eminent domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| elimination of miscellaneous fees such as admin fees, application fees, insurance compliance fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1448)|
| 0:24:17| and anything else that landlords can use to penny-pinch us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| We ask that there are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| I'm sorry, I lost my place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| We ask that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| Help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| We ask that you all keep affordable housing in the forefront of your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1484)|
| 0:24:52| So houses are for need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| I'll yield the rest of my time to the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak on Item 8A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1505)|

| 0:25:13| Your light is on, council member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| Thank you guys for bringing up this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| And we do need to look at up and down where all the decisions are made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| and try to use as many tools as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| So thanks for speaking on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| Council member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| Yes, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| I support your effort to organize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| And that's the best way actually you can influence the political arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| whether it be here or with the state, I would underline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| But you have my support as far as your organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| I hope it grows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| And it's that kind of collective action where you get together and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| analyze and work out real practical solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| So good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| Council member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Your name cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| I can't tell whose light is whose, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Yeah, council member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| And I echo the sentiments of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| I think that it is admirable that you all have come together under a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| common cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| I'm not certain if there are other unions across the state or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| but I would encourage you to research that because there is strength in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| I'd also like to ask either the law director or Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| if they could expand a little bit about to everyone and including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| council as to what is the authority of city council as it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| as it relates to enforcement and rent control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| Because again, I encourage this group by any means necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| but I do think that it is at a higher level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| The city council, if you guys could share a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| but I salute each of you and support your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| I think we've had this discussion before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| but it bears repeating that regardless of how sympathetic this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| the state legislature has preempted city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| this city council and all municipalities across the state from engaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| in any type of rent control activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Nobody said rent control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Do not interrupt us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Please do not interrupt or you'll be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| As that relates to any private property in this jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| And unless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| and until the state declines to preempt the city from that activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| the city is not legally authorized to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Council member Parker, and then we'll go back to you missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| I also appreciate all of the work that you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| I'm excited about a tenancy union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| And I feel that there is more that we can do here on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| And your work is actually helping us discover new strategies that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| I was able to attend a community day that you all hosted at Tanglewood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| and that allowed me to talk to folks at legal aid and bounce some ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| So I plan to bring a proposal forward that I hope my colleagues will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| That might give some relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| It's not rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| It's not rent caps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| It's not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| some of those options available to others in other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| but it's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| So I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| I'm working on that and I plan to bring something forward very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Council member Parker, council member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| Thank you mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| I wanted to follow with what my colleagues were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| What about, I know we can't do rent control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| What about the application fees and some of the extra fees that I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| Hannah had brought up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| Do we have any jurisdiction over that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| No, the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| And the answer to that question is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| We just can't control the manner in which they charge for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| that they rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Hey, please do not interrupt from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| You'll be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Council member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| The second piece was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| I know that UT law school and a couple other groups were working on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| eviction consortium to help out with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| with people needing representation and they had requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| I believe $800,000 from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Do you know where that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| That's the first I've heard of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| but I do know there are people who are doing eviction prevention stuff on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| the floor of the courthouse to try to help people before they even go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| because it's always helped much easier to prevent the eviction than after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| So there are people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| I've seen them when I walk into work on those eviction notice days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| that they're there to help with resources, rental assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| I mean, it's not necessarily enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| but I'd certainly be happy to hear from other entities who would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| interested in helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Is Carter Hall here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| Because he attended some of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1844)|
| 0:31:05| Carter Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| policy innovation manager for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| I know we had spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| spoken before and you were attending some of the meetings and I kind of let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| it go after that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| Can you tell me where things are with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| with that project and trying to help fund it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| So Wendy Bach with the UT law school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| had invited the city to participate in the what works cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| a program that they had put up talking about access to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| expanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| working with municipalities and other jurisdictions for having different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| options to expand legal aid to those facing eviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| The city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| as well as the county part of their community development sat in on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| At this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| there has been no direct ask to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| you mentioned $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| I have also not heard that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Maybe that was in a previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| Adam Hughes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| were you involved in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Would you mind coming to speak on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| if you could just state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1942)|

| 0:32:26| Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| we were fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| in my capacities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| the East Tennessee organizer with Sockham to work with the UT college of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| the geography and sustainability department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| other partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| including legal aid of East Tennessee representatives from the city and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| county in the sprint program with the idea of working to the point where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| we could expand representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| And I'm hopeful that it will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| And I think it's vitally needed just based on what I've seen in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| in eviction court today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| 112 families on the docket today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| And based on research that we've done with the geography and sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| about fewer than 5% of people facing eviction actually benefit from legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| representation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| So I think this is a place where the city can do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| So I'd like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| to pursue this further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| One thing I'm kind of following up on what the law director said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| the state also has the uniform landlord and tenant act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| which if there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| it lays out parameters about what a lease may and may not have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| And it also lays out the process for timely payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| late payment and moving towards an eviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| If unfortunately one's necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| the city has no part in that it's those actions are not filed in city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| They're filed in Knox County general sessions court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| So that's another the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| that uniform state law applies to some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| but not all municipalities and counties across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| but it does apply to those apartments in Knoxville and in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Council member saying just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Wendy box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| a longtime friend and I know her pretty well through her work as a legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| And I do remember that what works city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| So I think we signed on to as a letter of support for a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| But you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| I haven't heard what the outcome of that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| but just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| just for the particularly for the sake of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| our boy Scouts and others in the audience who may not be familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Sometimes it's easy to focus on what we can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| We can't do rent control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| We can't do rent freezes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| We're not allowed to you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| pass ordinances that regulate landlord and tenant on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| That's just something that's outside our purview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| but what we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| which is relevant to item eight a is you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| deal with land use and zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| appoint good people to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| planning commission and board of zoning appeals and continue the work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| This council has approved over $38 million towards affordable housing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| the last few years that has helped develop over 2000 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| affordable homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| affordable homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| countless members of those households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| I don't know how many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| of course that's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| we've done more than ever before in the history of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| but the needs are greater than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| and so this council has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| has always kept affordable housing front of mind and now more than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| And I know just next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| just later this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| we're going to talk about one small part of the solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| which is to promote more middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| So there's a more diversity of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| but that's just one part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| of a bigger solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| So we can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| instead of focusing on what we can't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| I really appreciate this council's focus on what we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| which is help support the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| developing more affordable housing and more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| more housing supply just in general across our city and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| and zoning and BZA is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| is one mechanism that we do have authority to use and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| and promote more affordable housing council member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| And then council member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| I just wanted to ask if Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| Odell is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2197)|

| 0:36:39| he's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| But I believe this is a second term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| This is a second term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| I just wanted to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Council member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| I'd like to ask Ben Bentley if he could come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| I'm not sure if he is aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| but if anyone in the room is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| it could be him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| I think what I'm hearing is from some of the people who are in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| audience is that this is a situation of people who are working people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| who cannot afford rents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| And so may not qualify for subs subsidies in section eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| which I would consider people who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| who sometimes because of rent and other financial obligations are barely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| making a paycheck to paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| And so when you are late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| there are late fees that are incurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Are you aware of any programs that are out there are available to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| people who don't qualify for section eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| because they do have jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| but the rents are so high along with other obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| Are you aware of anything that's available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| So there's a couple of things that we are trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| I'm saying we as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| and this is really the mayor and her administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| We're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| we're trying to incorporate in some of the market rate development that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| It's not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| It's not something that in our state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| they lay out an environment and love for us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| but we're trying to do that where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| It involves providing incentives to private entities that are building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| things to make sure that there are pieces of those units that are rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| So I think while that is not an immediate solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| and I just like to be honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| like that's not the answer right this minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| but long-term as we continue to try to build more and incorporate more of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| that type of housing into a new developments that will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| And so with the work workforce housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| I know if memory serves me correctly, we've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| we've heard 10 units here, five units there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| I don't recall anything more than 10 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| So the largest that we have done so far was 35 units on one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| We're trying to hit a 10 to 20% target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| We'd love to be more near 20%, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| So I think we will continue to refine that program working with our J justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| and her team on that to make sure we can create as many of those units as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| possible. But you're right. Councilwoman McKenzie, it's, it's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| And so with the workforce housing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| is there a timeframe that that price restriction is in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| As we know a lot with HUD funding, there's a 30 year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| So are there any type of limitations as it relates to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| The way the agreements are drafted at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| it has aligned with the public incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| So if the city is providing a pilot for X number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| that would be, and I think I've heard councilwoman Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| articulate this point before let's use our incentives to try to create the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| That's kind of what we're trying to do here is align the timing of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| incentive with the workforce housing timeline. It's not perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| but that's what we're going for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| And as we, as evidence, we know that that's definitely not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| It's a start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| but it's good because I don't know if everyone in the audience was even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| aware of that particular thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| And we know that when those workforce housing units are open again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| there'll be a waiting list for people applying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| And so we still find ourselves pretty much in the same dilemma, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| It's good to have that information as well. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| Council member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| Yes. For all you that have shown up, I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| As you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| you've reached out to me before and I've met you on site of what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| at Tanglewood was indeed greed and it was reprehensible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| the amount without notice that they raised rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| I simply want to say though, reach out to me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| I would love to have a meeting quite soon, maybe just a small group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| and we will just have a good general discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| I will kind of maybe put in context what the view is from here about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| possibilities and so reach out and thank you for coming and let's talk soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| Thank you, council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| And, you know, to counsel, I just also wanted to mention, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| during the heat, you know, the worst part of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| the federal government did send dollars to cities to help with rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| And then they send another infusion that went to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| the city and the county combined together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| And there's that rental assistance program. Those monies are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| we are working with our county partners to talk to the Tennessee housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| development agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| because we believe that they do have more funds available for rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| assistance that should be coming to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| They haven't released those yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| We're working hard to bring that money so then it can be similar to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| rental assistance available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| That was during the pandemic. We don't have those funds yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| We're waiting on the Tennessee housing development agency, THDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| we're working with our county partners to try to get that money released to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| help people in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2513)|

| 0:45:57| small townhomes in Fort Sanders area. These townhomes will be four bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| each. There are three variances requested as mentioned. The first is a sum of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2761)|
| 0:46:10| sorry, the first one is a corner side setback from 12 feet to 5 feet. Interior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| side setbacks are already five foot so this matches the interior. I would note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| that every other property on the same block has the exact same setbacks. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2781)|
| 0:46:28| all are within five feet. I did an analysis, it's included in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| that has every property on that side of the street as well as every property to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| the north. Every single property would require the same two variances on one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| and two to be rebuilt today. So it's the exact same as what every other property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| has. I would note that half of the building is offset due to the driveways and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2811)|
| 0:46:59| locations of those. That's what, with the rules of measurement, it makes it sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| worse than it is. But if you look at half the building at a time, half of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| building is actually at a, so 50% of the building is at a corner side setback of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2829)|
| 0:47:25| 13 foot, which is more than the requirement. Only half of the building will be at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| that five foot, the lesser amount, and that's due to those locations of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| driveways. When you average the two, it's actually nine foot for a difference of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| three. The second variance is the sum of the sides. So this is the interior and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2861)|
| 0:47:48| corner side together. The requirement is 15. I'm asking for 10. If it was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| interior lot, they're virtually all 10 foot anyways. That would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| requirement. 50% of the building has a sum of sides of 18 foot. Again, due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2879)|
| 0:48:07| those driveway locations. The other 50 foot is at 12 and a half foot. If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| average those two out for the offsets, it's over 15 foot, so it meets that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| requirement. And the hardship on this lot really has to do with the change in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| elevation. There's a 22 foot elevation change from north to south. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| driveways have to be spaced a certain distance, 50 foot from the corner, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| then you have to have a certain space between each driveway. So that's driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| where these have to go. The alley at the rear is also too narrow, so the alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2921)|
| 0:48:48| has to be extended towards. And the property drops off really steep towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| that south side, which means there will be a retaining wall there, so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| building can't be extended any further to the south. The third variance is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| lot width requirement. So when this request was written, the city council had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| not passed section 17.3. There was an amendment that just came active in force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2952)|
| 0:49:20| about a month ago. This amendment, 17.3, states that a non-conforming lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2960)|
| 0:49:31| record is a lot that one time was recorded, or that met the dimension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| requirements at one point in time. A non-conforming lot of record may be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| for any permitted use, and development of a non-conforming lot must meet all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| other dimensional standards except for lot width. So that other third variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| request should not be needed based on the passage of the 17.3 amendment last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=2994)|
| 0:50:01| month. And then finally, I include in your packet as well, the request is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3001)|
| 0:50:09| much in line with other recent variance approvals. I put together a quick list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| There's been 21 similar variances approved in just the last three years, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| they will pull up in a few minutes. Virtually everything in that area is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| to meet similar setbacks to what is requested. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3025)|

| 0:50:43| speaking in favor of that? Mr. Marlowe, please state your name and address for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| I'm speaking in favor of this because after reviewing the agenda packet, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| seems odd to me that this lot would be zoned RN5, yet be forced to only be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| redeveloped as either a single family or a duplex. That seems to be the opposite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| direction of what RN5 would suggest. In fact, it looks like he could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3070)|

| 0:51:22| of zoning. We're in a housing crisis, and we need to be focusing on allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3082)|
| 0:51:32| development where we think it's appropriate. I believe that the Fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3092)|

| 0:51:42| area in the state. And RN5 zoning is a pretty intense residential zoning. So to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| effectively force someone to build only a single family home or a duplex, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| going to require variances, just to build a duplex highlights the problems of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| their current zoning code and how it makes missing middle housing almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| impossible. So this lot, I would say, is a prime example of how missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| housing became missing in the first place. Even though we're in the densest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| neighborhood in the state, or at least one of the densest neighborhoods in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| state, with RN5 zoning, our current code almost forces this property owner to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| build a single family home. It seems absurd to me. I believe that if we can grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| this appeal and allow him to build his four townhomes with, I believe, four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3150)|

| 0:52:56| Thank you. Is there anyone else speaking in favor of Item 10A? Okay. These| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3176)|
| 0:53:03| appeals allow for up to three speakers who are opposed to the appeal. Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3183)|

| 0:53:58| three variances with the Board of Zoning Appeals. The Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| looks at situations where they might seek to allow variances from the strict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3242)|
| 0:54:10| application of the code. There are certain guidelines that control the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3250)|
| 0:54:18| decision-making process, and they're set out in the Appendix B of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| code. Briefly, variances will be granted only when special circumstances or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| conditions such as exceptional narrowness, topography, or siding fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3270)|

| 0:54:38| Variances will not be granted to allow a use otherwise excluded from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| particular district in which requested. Three, for reasons fully set forth in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| the findings of the board, the aforesaid circumstances are conditions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| such that the strict application of the provisions of this code would deprive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| the applicant of any reasonable use of his or her land. Mere loss of use does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| not justify a variance. There must be a deprivation of the beneficial use of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| land. Four, any variance granted under the provisions of the section must meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| the minimum adjustments necessary for the reasonable use of the land. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| five, the granting of any variance is in harmony with the general purposes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| intent of the code and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, detrimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| to the public welfare, or in conflict with the general plan for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| Thank you. Mr. Holmes, I'm very familiar with this property, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| Tell us a little. There is a development on the property now, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| That's correct. There is an existing house there. The existing structure has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| two foot two setback and 7.5 on one side, some is 9.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3346)|

| 0:55:57| It's a duplex. All right. All right, thank you. I just wanted to confirm that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| there is an existing property or development on the property. Mr. Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| I have some questions for you. If you would come to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| Thank you. This property is zoned RN5, and while we're not discussing rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3370)|
| 0:56:18| tonight, would you discuss what is available in the RN5 use table for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3378)|
| 0:56:27| Sure. Peter Ahrens, City of Knoxville, Plans Review and Inspections Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| So RN5 allows single family, two family, they allow townhouses, they allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3394)|
| 0:56:44| multifamily. You can pretty much do as dense as you can, provided you have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3404)|
| 0:56:52| space. Okay. The question I had is around the three variances that Mr. Holmes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3412)|
| 0:56:59| has requested. Is there a way to develop, either replace the existing home, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| duplex, or build that density that you just mentioned without all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| variances? Mr. Holmes has the right to rebuild that duplex, absolutely. You can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3429)|
| 0:57:18| repair and maintain existing structures all day long. As far as designing a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3438)|
| 0:57:25| intense development, I can't speak to that. That's something that Mr. Holmes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3445)|
| 0:57:32| his design team would develop. Okay. Thank you. I'll pause to see if any of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| colleagues have some questions. Council Member Testerman. Thank you. Just going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3458)|
| 0:57:46| through, Mr. Holmes, I do have a few questions for you. So there's a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3466)|
| 0:57:54| on there, and then... Correct. So the existing structure, it's built in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| 1930s. It's in really poor shape. As Peter said, state law allows it to be torn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3480)|
| 0:58:09| down and rebuilt, but you kind of lose your grandfathering of your existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| setbacks. Even if you took that same house today and you asked for a permit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3493)|
| 0:58:20| rebuild the exact same house, you're still going to have to get these same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| variances to rebuild it. Has that structure been condemned? Since 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3504)|
| 0:58:31| Right. So, okay. We're pushing on 10 years that that property's been condemned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| And to your point, you would lose all your grandfathering, and anything you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3517)|
| 0:58:44| it sounds like you're going to have to get some type of variance. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| correct? That's the way I see it. I mean, it's a 50-foot lot. When you lose 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3528)|
| 0:58:56| foot and an additional 5, you've lost 17 feet. That's over 30% of your lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3536)|
| 0:59:03| And so what, if you did not do these four townhomes, what are your options? Is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3543)|
| 0:59:10| just single family or another duplex? Or what other considerations have you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| So if you have more than four bedrooms in a unit now, the city considers it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| independent living. That would require variances as well. But what they came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3561)|
| 0:59:27| back and said was that you're not allowed to have driveways at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| So then that pushes a parking problem out to the rest of the city, or it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| results in having to build a driveway upon the interior lot line, which I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| think the neighbors would prefer that at all. It's certainly not as clean and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3581)|
| 0:59:48| doesn't provide as much parking. Right. And then what... I mean, I've read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| through everything. Can you just kind of top line what modifications you've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| since we discussed this property? Oh, so previously, I was trying to do more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3600)|
| 1:00:07| units but smaller units. Since then, I've reduced the density down 35% from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| where we started. The original goal was to have 24 bedrooms across six units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3613)|
| 1:00:20| Scaled that down to four small units at four bedrooms each. I think it's a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3620)|
| 1:00:27| balance between economics, making the numbers work to do the project. It provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3627)|
| 1:00:34| enough parking for the tenants, and it's going to blend in with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| It's going to match the same style and consistency of Fort Sanders. It will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| a large porch on the front, large porches for each unit, brick construction with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3642)|
| 1:00:49| hardy siding. So I want something that fits with the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| If you go to the independent living and you lose the driveways on the side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| inevitably, you're going to end up with a blockier, modern-looking kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| structure. I don't think it's going to be as cohesive with especially that side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| of the fort, which is more older style. But then if you do more density, to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| point, you've got the parking issue, which is already a compromised parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| area. Parking is getting to be at a very critical level over there, and it's only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| getting worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Okay. That's all I have at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| Thank you. Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Yeah. Mr. Holmes, you said the units that you want to build, they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3691)|
| 1:01:39| match and fit with the character of what's there? Those are the words you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| It's going to be similar. The design I've picked out kind of mimics the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| original side gable. The front's going to be radically different. The existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| house has a really funky roof line with a weird offset. But it'll mimic the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| design guidelines of Fort Sanders with gables, the Victorian styles, historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| looking brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| So when I look at the aerial, I see multiple blocks of houses that are, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| of them are subdivided into multiple units, but they all face, Laurel? They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| all face the street, the front street, but you want to tear down the one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| has the same setbacks and faces the same direction and turn everything to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| side street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| Actually, no. So from the front, it will look like a traditional house on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| street. And the way the setback works on that front unit, when you pull up onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| 23rd and you're going down 23rd, you're going to see what looks like a house. As| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| you get to the next unit, it's actually inset an additional eight foot. You will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| not even see that side from 23rd. You'll see the gable of the third unit, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| all hides the fourth unit because it steps in, the way the offsets work. So when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| you look at it from that side, you'll probably see like a porch there, a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| bit of an overhang that kind of hides the garage, but there's this very large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| eight foot inset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Okay. I don't know, Mr. Ahrens, if, I know Mr. Ahrens is answering questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| for the city, but I just, there've been a couple of statements that conflicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| with something in the record from the BZA. So I'd like Mr. Ahrens or Mr. Berry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| to respond. On page 116 of our packet, there's the statement from BZA with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3811)|
| 1:03:41| Berry that says, hold on a second. The applicant can build a single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3821)|
| 1:03:52| dwelling or a two family dwelling that faces onto Laurel and meet the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| dimensional requirements of the RN-5 zoning district. That's a fact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3835)|
| 1:04:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| Okay. Well, because a couple of, there've been a couple of statements made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| that it can't be done without variances, but Mr. Berry was correct when he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| stated he could build a duplex without variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| So you can, you can rebuild what's there. You can, you can repair what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| there and you can add on to what's there if you don't change the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| You can't add on to it on those lines if you create a townhouse development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| That's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| So if he clears the lot...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| Then all grandfathering lights go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| Okay. And so with RN-5, he couldn't build a duplex. In RN-5...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| He would be subject to the dimension...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| The setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| The setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| Within the setbacks that are required in RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| Okay. That's all. I just want to clarify because the statement was made that he couldn't and he could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| It wouldn't be the same dimensions as what sits on the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| But he could build a duplex on that lot if it was issued that met the setbacks in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| You asked my question, so I just wanted to confirm that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| And that's the exact reason that I won't be able to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| We need more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| Mr. Holmes, you can build more density on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| But we shouldn't set a precedent for rezoning by way of BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| And I feel like this does not meet the deprivation of beneficial use of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| And I don't think it adheres to the standards for granting a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| We heard this same, similar matter for the same property in our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| And I don't feel any different about it now than I did then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| These variances are not required in order to use the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| And as Councilman Ryder just affirmed with Mr. Aarons, a duplex and other more dense uses can be built on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3959)|
| 1:06:08| So I won't be supporting this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| But I do support additional work Mr. Holmes does in Port Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3970)|
| 1:06:17| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| I have a couple questions. I'm not sure. It's somewhere between Mr. Clabo and Mr. Aarons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| Do these variances that are requested pose any type of safety hazard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| During the BZA meeting where they're looking for hardships, the safety hazards did not come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=3995)|
| 1:06:43| How about are there any detrimental aspects to the environment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4003)|
| 1:06:51| Any detrimental aspects would be captured through stormwater regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| Which is why to me this seems like with the crisis that we are in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| and to make the density that can be allowed on RM5, this seems like a beneficial use of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4021)|
| 1:07:08| So I'll be voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| Any other questions or comments? Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| Yeah, I get it. This is tough. And I did not support it the last time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| I do feel like it was kind of trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4045)|
| 1:07:34| But you also are in a zoning that encourages density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| And I feel like Mr. Holmes has gone back, modified, decreased, but tried to be creative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4059)|
| 1:07:47| maintain the integrity of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| I mean, it's not ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| But here we are tonight with a room full of people and students who are crying out for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4072)|
| 1:08:00| And I know that we do want to keep with integrity and character, and I fully support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4080)|
| 1:08:10| And it might not be the best solution or the perfect solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| but I feel like it's a reasonable solution that he's trying to create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| And it's tough. I want to support it. I think it's a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4101)|
| 1:08:30| But we are looking at RM5 and trying to leverage and maximize the ability to create housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4110)|
| 1:08:41| to go back. I mean, and the cost to redo what's there has got to be so cost prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4121)|
| 1:08:51| I can't. And just repairing what's there, because you've got to upgrade codes and everything that comes along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4131)|
| 1:09:00| So, you know, for those reasons, I'm going to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4140)|
| 1:09:07| I feel like he's jumped through a lot of hoops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| BZA was a bit split, a lot of discussion around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| So that's where I'm going to land at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| Thank you. Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| Yes. Consistent with some comments that Councilperson Ryder and Councilperson Smith have made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4163)|
| 1:09:31| and also, but most importantly, what I think I heard from Peter Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| it sounds like that we can greatly increase density on this site by staying with the RM5 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4174)|
| 1:09:44| And it was a close call at the Board of Zoning Appeals, and it's a close call here in lots of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4184)|
| 1:09:52| But I'm going to defer, I think, to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| And I don't think this came before us again, and I don't see anything that's significantly changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| So we can increase density here without changing the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4202)|
| 1:10:08| which was designed to protect Fort Sanders, which has been an onslaught, I guess it might be said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4208)|
| 1:10:17| of what was once a Victorian neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| And I would like to try to keep some of the character there that's left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| So I'm going to have to deny the appeal, I think, or vote to deny it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4228)|
| 1:10:38| Vice Member Berta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| Thank you, Mayor. I definitely see, and looking through the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| you know, BZA really struggled with this, as my colleagues had talked about as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| You know, I think going back to Council Member Smith's point about the dangers of rezoning by BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| I think that's a true point. I think that's what Council Member Thomas was also expressing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4256)|
| 1:11:03| I don't believe Council Member Smith's motion was seconded, so I will second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| Vice Member Berta, there's a motion on the floor to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| Anne was made and seconded before the discussion started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| Just point of order, I'll make a second on the motion that Council Member Smith brought for those reasons. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4279)|
| 1:11:27| What was that? Point of order, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| Well, Council Member Smith made a motion, I'm seconding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| I know that priority is going to go to the first one, but I'm just making that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| Okay, so the first motion on the floor is to approve the appeal, the second motion is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| So we'll go back to the first priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| I believe it's Council Member Singh's motion should be voted on first, it was the first one made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| Yes, it takes priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| Okay, so when the next vote comes, it'll be on Council Member Singh's motion to approve that was made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4320)|
| 1:12:08| So that's the current motion we're discussing, and there's more discussion to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| Council Member Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| Thank you. I just want a clarification from Mr. Frost again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| Legally, what can we do with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4339)|
| 1:12:27| Hardship, you read the whole thing, but can you give me the nuggets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| Thank you, Council Member Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| There are five elements that are supposed to meet the following criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| Very briefly, the property has to have exceptional or special circumstances, including topography that does not apply generally to the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4363)|
| 1:13:01| They won't be, variances won't be granted to allow a use otherwise excluded from the particular district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4381)|
| 1:13:10| And that the strict application would deprive the applicant of reasonable use of his or her land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4390)|
| 1:13:17| And it goes on to say, mere loss in value does not justify a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| There must be a deprivation of beneficial use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| And then the last one, granting will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the code and not be injurious to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4407)|
| 1:13:36| detrimental to the public welfare, or conflict with the general plan for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| Thank you. That helps as we get ready to vote about what are the reasons we can overturn BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4423)|
| 1:13:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| Thank you. Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| Thank you, Mayor. I just want to follow up on that comment because I think it's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| As much as we want to rezone things the way we want or change the shape of development to fit a specific need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4442)|
| 1:14:09| or it just doesn't apply to the decision we're legally obliged to, we have to stand firm on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4449)|
| 1:14:16| Otherwise, we're going to make willy-nilly decisions as new opportunities come before us for any measure that comes from BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| And as we've seen from previous variances, it's very important to be consistent with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4462)|
| 1:14:28| and to abide by what was outlined by Mr. Frost, which one of those elements was some type of natural challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4468)|
| 1:14:36| that is unique or out of character, or excuse me, not like the rest of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| Well, I think as Mr. Holmes made the case, there's this type of slope in many places throughout Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| Furthermore, I think it's very important that, particularly related to Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| if you look back over the arc of time, the way that that neighborhood has been chipped away at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| in terms of losing the character of the neighborhood, I have no doubt, Mr. Holmes, I've seen your developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| I think you do a good job. You will maintain the character of Fort Sanders neighborhood with your design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| That's not what we're deciding on, and zoning's not what we're deciding on either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| So I think it's really important to remember the long arc of the design and the use of land in Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4512)|
| 1:15:20| and how it's been chipped away at by making these little curbs and cutting corners on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4520)|
| 1:15:27| So again, I don't think these variances are any different than the ones we voted on two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4527)|
| 1:15:34| and I think they're out of line with what we're required to vote on related to variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| Thank you. Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| I think that's consistent with what Mr. Frost has told us. I have a lot of empathy for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| I really do, but I don't think that developing within RN-5 on this lot would, under the regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4549)|
| 1:15:56| deprive him of the use of the property, and I don't think the criteria for a hardship is being met either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| So I can't vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| Thank you. Okay, so the motion on the floor is to approve the appeal in item 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4567)|
| 1:16:15| Any other questions or discussion? Seeing none, all those in favor of approving this appeal, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| Aye. Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| Okay, the motion does not carry. The motion fails. Is there a new motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4584)|
| 1:16:31| Council Member Smith. Thank you, Mayor. I'll make a motion to deny the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| on the grounds that it doesn't meet the hardship requirements of the variance. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| Motion made to deny the appeal from Council Member Smith, seconded by Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| Any questions or discussion? Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| I'm a little confused by procedure. If we voted that down, doesn't that do what your motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| Our law director says that for the sake of clarity and based on previous litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4613)|
| 1:16:59| we have to have an affirmative denial, not just against approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| You are correct, but the Court of Appeals can't figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| So, since the Court of Appeals will just satisfy their demands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| So the motion on the floor is to deny. It's been made and seconded. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| Thank you, Mayor. I had concerns about this agenda item when I first saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4641)|
| 1:17:31| Before us, concerns about how much is trying to be crammed into one space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4651)|
| 1:17:38| but as I looked through the documents and listened to the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| it seemed like a really thoughtful design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| The hardship seems to be there and seems to be in line with other appeals that I voted in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4665)|
| 1:17:58| I don't know what the variances we voted on two weeks ago are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| I don't remember there being a BZA appeal before me, but it seems like we have had issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4683)|
| 1:18:11| pertaining to Fort Sanders come before us in the past and have seen a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4691)|
| 1:18:19| So I'm not an expert on this piece of property, but I feel like it's a really reasonable plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4699)|
| 1:18:28| that's come before us and it's in alignment with other variances that we have approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| or that BZA has approved. So that's why I was in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| I realize the numbers aren't there, but just wanted to lift that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4717)|
| 1:18:43| I don't know what other variances we voted on that this would be in alignment with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4723)|
| 1:18:54| Thank you. Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| Seeing none, all those in favor of denying this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| let's do a roll call vote just for the sake of clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| So a yes vote is saying in favor of denying the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| A no vote is not in favor of denying the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| So yes is saying the appeal is denied. No is saying the appeal is not denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| Does everyone understand? Okay, will you conduct the roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| Councilman Smith? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| Vice Mayor Roberto? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| Councilwoman Fugate? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| Councilwoman McKenzie? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| Councilwoman Parker? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| Councilwoman Ryder? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| Councilwoman Testerman? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| Councilman Thomas? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| Did you ask me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| Oh, I'm sorry, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| So the motion carries 6-3, the appeal is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4806)|
| 1:20:13| 11A is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with the United Way of Greater Knoxville Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| to provide funding in an amount not to exceed $425,000 for a multifaceted community schools initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4819)|
| 1:20:26| in 14 schools located within the corporate midst of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| which promotes community resources to achieve healthy communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| Councilmembers, there's one person signed up to speak in favor of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| and one person signed up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| Rick Roach, if you'd come to the podium, he signed up to speak in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4845)|
| 1:20:56| Technically, I'm, excuse me, Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| Technically, I'm not in favor or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| I would love to hear some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| Rarely do we see the city dealing with education funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4865)|
| 1:21:13| especially at this amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| And I'm slightly familiar with the community schools program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4876)|
| 1:21:24| I guess my question would be, the city voting on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| but the funding is coming from United Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4890)|
| 1:21:36| what's the money going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| I know one person who is a nurse at, I guess, potentially one of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4899)|
| 1:21:48| I couldn't pull up the details of the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| so I don't know all the schools involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| But I imagine that this one school is part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| And she is a nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| And she has spoken of the difficulties involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| and the end result of the community schools program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| in terms of bringing resources, not just to the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| but to families at these particular schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| So if we could get some clarification, hopefully from someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| from our Knox County school system to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| Maybe someone from United Way who may have some details about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| and explain what the heck is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4957)|
| 1:22:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| Council members, I believe this is the agenda packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| but this is the same amount of money that you've approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| for the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| This funding originally started back when I was on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| And there's one way the city has supported this afterschool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| and holistic support services for children in high-need schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| There's no change in the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| It's just a change in who's conducting the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| It used to be the Knoxville Education Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| and now the programmatic operational side of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| is being handled by United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| And Matt Ryerson is here if council members have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| But before we go to your discussion, there's one other person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| who signed up to speak in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| Ms. Constance Every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5011)|
| 1:23:41| All right, Constance Every, 37914 Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| You know, let's call it for what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| because nobody comes and talks about the elephant but me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| But this is a joke, because you all have not invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| in city schools, as Rick Roach pointed out, in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| However, what's coming into Knoxville next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| The charter school. That's what's coming into Knoxville next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| And how ironic that in the same following year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| that the charter school's going to roll in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| you all are now ready to make a partnership with United Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| and give them almost a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| Ironic? Not at all. Typical? Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| If you are serious about these initiatives, as I continue to call you out for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| as I've done on the campaign trail when we ran for the mayorship just now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| if you are serious about these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| then I would like to run back Freedom Schools, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| We just had a whole war this summer over a simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| youth enrichment initiative through Freedom Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| that was requesting to use the Knox County bus line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| This was an excellent time to bring that kind of funding in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| and partnership in if we were serious, city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| about city schools and initiating programs for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| Once again, you all getting ready to kill our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| Austin East, Vine, Surmore Green, Green School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| all of the inner city schools need to pay attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| because when this charter school comes in, our schools are officially dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| And that's what they want to do. I cannot say this enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| United Way is a predator in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| They are not there as a safe haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| They're not there because they care about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| They're there because what people do when it comes to black problems and black issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| You profit and you gain from our pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| You champion our struggles for talking points and for votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| But when it's time to do the real work in our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| you never show up, you're never there, and more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| you never come with purse strings and initiatives for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| So I just think it's hilarious to see that now that we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| this charter school rolling through, you are now ready to do a partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| You choose your big brother middle man, United Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| give them a half a million dollars, but the truth be told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| you're going to kill our schools. I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| Council, that concludes. People sign up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| Yeah, I don't know if Ms. Smith or Ms. Ball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| I think the mayor just answered it as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| but how many years have we been giving this amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| to the community schools program? Ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| At least ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| You know, I remember I was working for Mayor Rojero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| when it was back in the books then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| and I think it started out at about $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| It went up to about $200,000, and then went up to $450,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| and it's been at $450,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| I believe it's increased during my time on the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| We've been giving this money to community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| Ms. Smith, how much do we give to the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| out of our local option? Is there a local option sales tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| How much are we funding the county school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| Off the top of your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| The amount that we actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| the city does not actually send money to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| The schools, that money is actually taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| $0.72 out of every sales tax dollar collected in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| goes to Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| But it's millions and millions and millions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| It's like $130 million at least a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| $130 million a year out of the city budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| Was that since the 80s that we've been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| that local option sales tax? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| I just need to report it for the public record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| that we do fund the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| We've been funding community schools for this many years, over 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| It has steadily increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| And we give, I believe you just said $130 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| of our local sales tax that we don't get to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| on city programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| because they go straight from our tax coffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| to the county schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| Please do not disrupt the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| Mr. Ryerson, do you mind? I have three minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| This is a shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| The money previously went to Knox Education Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| and United Way is now taking the employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| and operating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| Could you elaborate just for my couple of minutes here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| about the shift of the community schools program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| from Knox Education Foundation to United Way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| Yeah, we were, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| I appreciate that, Councilwoman, and it's an honor to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| by the Knox Education Foundation CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| If we'd be interested in taking over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| administrative responsibilities of community schools for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| We went through a due diligence process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| number one, to check if it aligned with our mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| and then number two, is it a project that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| add value to, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| grow it from the great foundation it was built into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| And so we, after that due diligence process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| and board approval, took on that initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| This year, so we are in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| Every school in the city is staffed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| and I know that was a big part of the original agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| is making sure that there was a coordinator positioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| in each school to ensure those services and resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| were brought to bear. So that's the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| I don't know if I answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| Yeah, so you're maintaining the same number of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| in the same number of schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| Yeah, actually, we're adding an evaluation component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| for staff coordinators at the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| but we're adding some extra components to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| and make sure those resources are in position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| Thank you. Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| Thank you, Mayor. Mr. Ryerson, my questions are for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| as well, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| So, in our packet, it states that the United Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| shall provide a comprehensive strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| for the Community Schools Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| And I was wondering if you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| help me understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| experience the United Way has had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| with providing program staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| for K-12 programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| Yeah, this is kind of a new space for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| stepping into this and researching this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| We brought on a lot of the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| Adam Fritz might be able to join me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| He is the current Director of Community Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| He came over from the Knox Education Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| So the key, Councilwoman, was getting the right staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| in position, so we reached out to that team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| and transitioned as many of the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| that were interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| And then this summer went through a pretty comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| hiring practice to ensure that the right fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| for each school, including which we had principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| and the direction of their site coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| but the interview process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| But if it's okay, Director Fritz may add to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| a little color to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| Yes, so we, Adam Fritz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| Director of Community Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| I've been doing community schools since 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| I started one of the pilots that took place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| at Lonsdale Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| We have grown the initiative over the last 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| to 14 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| 14 of those are covered with the dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| that are provided by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| We are now, as Mr. Ryerson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| grateful that we have been able to build back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| the initiative to where we do have staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| in each of the community schools this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| We have not been able to do that for the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| So that's one of the benefits of us going to the United Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| is being able to support and get our initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| going again previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| And I'm happy to answer any other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| that you may have as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| And so the relationship with the United Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| is both for that financial sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| as well as they're really taking over the whole program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| Yeah, and I would also say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| I think one of the benefits that we have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| on the short term is being able to have access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| to the partnership network that the United Way has access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| You know, previously a lot of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| was taking place at a site level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| and all of the need is drawn from the site level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| We do asset mapping and needs assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| to determine what happens at each individual school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| Each individual school bases what it is that they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| on the stakeholders of that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| the students, the families, the school staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| and the community there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| I think one of the things that has come to fruition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| from this partnership is allowing us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| to address those things at a higher level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| So one of the examples that I can give is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| we have worked with Big Brothers Big Sisters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| and they're now placing a site-based mentor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| in Vine, Middle, and Maynard Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| where they're going to be having a site-based mentor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| that is going to be having a caseload of up to 30 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| And figuring out with a partner how to address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| in a more holistic fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| So that's one example of a way that we have sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| looked at a need that was taking place at the site level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| and been able to address that a little more holistically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| through those partnerships that we didn't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| have access to previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| Okay, thank you. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| I have a minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| I'm a bit uncomfortable with this move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| And I realize that it's not my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| It's not our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| But it is our decision to determine whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| we can entrust these funds to be invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| how they need to be invested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| if they're in the right location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| And I just have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| I have some concerns when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| decision makers are more removed from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| the school environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| and the population that's being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| That's what concerns me the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| And I only have 10 seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| so I'm going to end mine there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| But you're very welcome to respond if you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| Yeah, I think that's a great answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| And the United Way Network nationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| has a lot of United Ways dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| They do the work of community schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| community school strategy, and one of the key elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| of that is the key stakeholder committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| that really engages the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| the parents, and the school administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| They really have to drive the decision making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| around the work and what is needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| because it's not just the school, it's the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| I agree with you 100% that that voice is vital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| And they've got a great framework to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| drive the decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| Thank you, Mayor. Just two comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| One is it is very clear to me the value of this role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| because my kids go to a Title I school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| There's a community schools person there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| We've been blessed with three great back-to-back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| They've all gone into work with children in other capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| The teachers are taxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| Schools are taxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| This person really is the linchpin between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| parents and businesses, so I could preach for hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| about the value of this and how important it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| because I see it weekly in my kids' schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| so I don't have any confusion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| My second point is just always a good opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| to piggyback on the city's funding towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| Knox County Schools for our Boy Scouts that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| Public knowledge. If you live in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| you pay for, you contribute to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| through your city and county taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| your contribution is equivalent to every school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| in all of South Knoxville, so it's no small amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| that the city contributes to public schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| and this is one of the most pivotal roles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| to bridge the community and the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| and if you're on the ground and see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| there's no confusion about it. You realize the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| of these people who are committing themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| to these kids. They're the Swiss army knife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| of school care, so I'm happy to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| Thank you. Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| Thank you, Mayor. I want to ask Mr. Ryerson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| or someone from United Way, is this uncommon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| Are there other United Ways in other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| that serve in this capacity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| Yeah, we just had a convening of a Zoom meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| of United Ways around the network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| so there's 1,000 United Ways in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| and right now about 200 of them are operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| and administrating community schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| so as much as we're new to it here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| and we're certainly learning and committed to learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| we also have a broad-based network that supplies us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| with supports and best practices from all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| Okay, and just for those who did not have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| that aren't privy to the packet information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| or couldn't pull it up, the 14 community schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| are as follows, Belmont Magnet Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| Morris Elementary, Christenberry Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| Dogwood Elementary, Green Magnet Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| Lonsdale Elementary, Maynard Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| Norwood Elementary, South Knox Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| Sarah Moore Green Magnet Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| Spring Hill Elementary, Fine Middle Magnet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| Westview Elementary, and Whittlesprings Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| Those are our 14 identified community schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| and they have been identified as community schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| to my knowledge, for at least the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| five to 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| Okay, I just wanted to confirm that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| Thank you. If you will indulge me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| I want to go a trip down memory lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| So the dream of community schools started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| in the early 2000s with Nine Counties, One Vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| The Public Education Task Force worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| No, it is not unusual for United Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| to be involved in this. As a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| they took a trip to the United Way in Cincinnati| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| where community schools was actually the role model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| that they looked for as they began to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| bringing community schools to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| So it has been a long time coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| There are also community schools that are in partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| with the University of Tennessee. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| the largest network is through what became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| the Public Education Foundation, which then became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| LEAD Knox and all the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| It is an extremely important component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| to improving education within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| It provides wraparound services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| after school tutoring, all the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| that students need to strive and thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| It is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| I am proud that this was established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| I'm proud that it was going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| when I was on the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| I'm proud that as chair of the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| I sat on the board of the group that was working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| on community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| The money has increased. The need has increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| I'm very pleased that we're back in all 14 schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| and have a site coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| You can only deliver the program if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| site coordinators that are engaged with the families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| the educators, and the larger community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| to know what the community needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| I wholeheartedly support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| I commend you for continuing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| The Education Foundation wanted to change its focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| from program delivery to more programmatic research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| They went looking for a partner in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| who would take on the administration of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| so we did not lose this valuable resource in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| Thank you, United Way, for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| I fully intend to support this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| Councilmember Thomas and then Vice-Member Berto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| I appreciate the holistic approach that you're taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| From the mission statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| you talk about maximizing student learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| optimize individual and community health standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| create long-term supports that strengthen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| families and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| And then the collaborative aspect of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| is involving community constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| and the business sector and governmental entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| So that kind of umbrella approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| at least on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| I don't vouch to know exactly how you're implementing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| but I haven't seen any red flags go off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| that you've been, in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| abusing the money that we've sent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| The holistic approach, where it's all encompassing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| is much appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| And then, just simply for the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| of the folks in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| and this is kind of following up on what Councilperson McKenzie said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| this is just for the folks in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| Three of the 14 schools are included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| in this allocation that's in the fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| And that's Christenbury Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| and Norwood Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| So I fully intend to support this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| Thank you. Vice Member Burdell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| Thank you, Mayor. Mr. Ryerson, if we kind of zoom out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| and look at what this program is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| aren't we really talking about removing barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| to student learning? Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| Yeah, that's a great way to phrase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| You know, I think my wife even got confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| when we started talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| She was like, are you going to be a principal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| And I said, no, no, no, we're not in the business of academics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| but we're in the business of supporting schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| So the way we kind of view it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| schools are the pipeline for all of our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| And what we want to be on the exterior of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| is create an insulation and support system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| to really support the kids and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| as they go through that pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| And that is done through, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| over 200 different programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| and nonprofit organizations in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| that we can really bring to bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| Can you maybe highlight a few of those for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| You know, some of those ways that you're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| I know I took a tour of the community school at Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| a few years back, and I was really impressed by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| And I just thought it might give you an opportunity here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| to highlight a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| Yeah, thank you. You know, the partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| often highlighted as one of the most visible programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| is after-school programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| So, you know, the goal to be able to extend that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| for those children in a safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| and academically friendly environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| that also gives parents, especially working parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| that need that extra couple hours to finish their day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| and then pick up their children after work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| is a key element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| But that's really probably one of the most visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| But, you know, there's a sad reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| that many of these schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| I dare say all of these schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| are in desperate need of increased access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| to mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| It is heartbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| Some of the stories and the accessibility problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| we have to mental health care in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| and our mental health community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| is trying to meet the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| But post-pandemic, we've seen such an increased need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| Those are two primary areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| but it goes to health, dental care, vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| after-school tutorial programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| before-school type programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| So it's really that insulation around the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| really allowing our teachers to teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| Our teachers are far too often called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| to be case managers, therapists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| you know, whatever the families are needing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| to get that kid in that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| you know, get that kid the supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| they need to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| This way we can use these coordinators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| to take that burden off the teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| and really invest in these families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| with the resources available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| Not only for the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| but also the access and the approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| that you're dealing with is supporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| you know, working families that really need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| that support as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| I plan on supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6288)|

| 1:45:49| to speak to Item 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| Hi, my name is George Habib.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| I live at 4501 Tillery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| formerly known as the Tinglewood Apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| but currently the Rand at Tillery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| I know that we asked before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| how many people among the crowds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| are renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| but I didn't really see any hands raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| from this side of the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| so I'm going to ask it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| How many people here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| have rented in the past five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| Mr. Habib, we tend to just focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| on listening to your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| Yes, so if you'll let me finish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| then I can tell you how this is pertinent to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| because this is kind of an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| that's in your administration right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| So how many of you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| have been renters in the past five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| I see one, maybe two hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| depending on the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| How many people have been renters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| in the past year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| I only see one hand currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| and this is somebody that's sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| on the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| and this is somebody who's supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| to be making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| for all the people who are here in the crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| So definitely it is an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| that renters are underrepresented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| among the people who are on the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| So how am I to trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6422)|

| 1:47:08| in this emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| this housing crisis emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| to make sure that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| has affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| to stop illegal evictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| to make sure that nobody is homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| as a result of this unaffordable housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| I think the emergencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| just keep on compounding among themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| So I do agree with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| that this isn't exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| but I bring this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6452)|

| 1:47:40| I bring this resolution up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| because clearly you have the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| to ask for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| You have the power to divert funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| You have the power to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| that some emergencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| like the housing emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6472)|

| 1:48:26| to come up with your own solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| and your own perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| on this emergency situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| I would like to respond to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| So I still rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| but I'm in a very special position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| because I rent from family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| If I did not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| I would be in the same position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| and I don't believe that I can ask my boss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| for a raise either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| I feel you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| I think most people on council do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| We need to keep up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| come up with more creative answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| There are limitations to what we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| but we've got to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| things that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| I think some of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| that we'll do on evictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| will be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| and share ideas if you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| Sincerely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| With the rest of my time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| that y'all are all considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| how you're going to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| And some of y'all are incumbents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| and being going to be voted on in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| So I want to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| how you are going to show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| for your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| that you expect to show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| for you at the polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| This is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| Some of y'all could be recalled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| if you don't show up for your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| how we're asking you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| We are here today in mass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| telling you that this is an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| So if you could please pay attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| I know that you have power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| to do something with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| But what are you doing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6597)|
| 1:50:05| I'm addressing you Mayor Kincannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| and also everybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| who's on the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| What are those creative solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| that you can tell me today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| I heard a lot about what y'all can't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| but I'm not hearing enough about what you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| Remember, we have some Boy Scouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| who were here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| They are renters and voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| So what kind of example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| are you setting for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| in terms of who's their leadership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6629)|
| 1:50:41| Again, I'm asking y'all to consider this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| because you are not renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| So listen to the people who are renters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| in this current emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| This has been years in the making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| and what are you doing about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| I asked you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| The next person signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| is Constance Every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| Ms. Every, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6660)|
| 1:51:12| Constance Every, 37914 Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| First off, as a veteran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| my boy Brandon back there is a veteran too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| there is no such thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| as the Department of Military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| The Department of Defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| is what you're taking the contract to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| More importantly, the $150,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| as it has been identified by George,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| I agree there is great concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| around the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| because let's not forget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| an apartment got hit by a tornado| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| and we did not see any resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| or any funding or any assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| given to those community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| Instead, they were booted out their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| as well and put on the street too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| So my concern is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| this is why I told Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| to see what $150,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| has actually been spent on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| Just like we need to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| what that $425,000 has been spent on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| because as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| this looks like and smells like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| another type of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| that's going to bring more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| military surplus equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| into our police department's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| Let's not forget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| Indy rode around the city in a tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| Y'all forgot about the tank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| I didn't forget about the tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| We also know from Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| that they send in Iraqi training troops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| I still cannot understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| why KPD needs that type of training equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| Let's not forget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| Knox County Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| has a Black Hawk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| Again, what do you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| that type of equipment for in America?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| So, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| I'm not convinced that this $150,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| is used for emergency needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| because we have had a tornado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| I have seen our streets flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| I have seen our lights go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| when the wind blows too hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| I have seen when our lights go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| because of a storm coming through our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| I mean, I'm being serious at this point, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| What do you spend the money on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| Because you're not spending on affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| You're not spending on homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| You're not spending on workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| and Black entrepreneurship development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| You're not spending on the needs of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| like grocery stores and medical deserts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| and food deserts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| You're not spending money on anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| that is serving the need of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| as George has highlighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| that has multiple emergencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| and what are you spending the taxpayer dollars on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| And y'all taking this money on the next item from DOJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| We're going to talk about that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| So, at this point, we need to get in contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| with our federal administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| let them know that Knoxville needs a forensic audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| dating back not just from India's two administrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| but going all the way back to Victor Ashe's administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| because to me that's when it started being abuse of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| because that's when your boy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| what's his name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| Remind me real quick, what's his name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| Bill, what's his name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| Bill Lyons, the ultimate corrupted individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| So again, Knoxville, pay attention how they spend the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| pay attention how they don't spend the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| and more importantly, question what they claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| they spend the money on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| because we don't see line item budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| to suffice or even support their needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| that they claim they spend the money for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| and therefore, this is why we come up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| to continue to challenge you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| on how you claim you're budgeting our tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| in the need of us, the constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| who pays this dollars in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| Council members, that concludes people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| who signed up to speak to this item on 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6862)|
| 1:54:27| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| I would just like to ask Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| just for a point of order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| when people are signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| to different agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| they may not be aware that we are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| to listen to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| and that piece has to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| when we have our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| So, if you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| maybe just to clarify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| we don't want people to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| that we're just not being participatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| in what they're asking us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| but that the point of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| is that we're here only to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| Council Member McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| it's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| the members of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| can come and speak on the items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| in any type of situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| if a member of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| has a question like they did earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| for the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| from the United Way, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| That's appropriate how, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| Mr. Holmes was asked questions earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| how Mr. Ahrens was asked questions earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| That's the standard protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6944)|

| 1:55:48| We can choose to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6948)|

| 1:55:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| So, there's no ban on a given take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| There's no answer and response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| If you as a member of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| would like to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=6960)|

| 1:57:24| Someone signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| I didn't see your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| Very correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7056)|
| 1:57:41| A few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7061)|
| 1:57:42| just out of necessity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| I got involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| I was a resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| in the Williams Creek watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| As a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| Tennessee Clean Water Network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| sued KUB because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| lack of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| and basically it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| polluting and killing folk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| which they'll never admit to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| but pretty much that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| what was happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| within the Williams Creek watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| We know this because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| eventually a consent decree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| was agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| and Williams Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| oh, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| I'm thoroughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| in favor of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| or resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| anything to repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| some of the damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| while KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| a serial polluter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| as we have seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| But anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| within the Williams Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| watershed was in such bad shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| and that's a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| portion of East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| Significant portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| Runs from basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| It would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| actually the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| headwaters of the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| It runs primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| through from now the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| headwaters are at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| MLK at Harrison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| and run all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| to the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| But we were suffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| greatly, unbeknownst to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| most of the people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| live in that watershed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| from all types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| and at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| Williams Creek was given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| a consent decree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| because normally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| when you see something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| like a utility company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7184)|
| 1:59:45| get sued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| the first thing they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| is start negotiating for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| a consent decree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| because they don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| to pay out the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| to compensate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| communities that they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| harm to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7194)|
| 1:59:55| because it would be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| millions, in some cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| billions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| You know, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7199)|
| 2:00:00| where I first repeatedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| heard the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| about environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| You know, that term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| came out repeatedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| But to show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7210)|
| 2:00:11| how much concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7211)|
| 2:00:12| there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| at least within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| legal system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| the civil legal system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| the amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| that was designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| to help repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| the damage done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| within the watershed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| was only $167,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7231)|
| 2:00:32| That's all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| predominantly black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| was worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| yeah, I'm using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7243)|
| 2:00:44| this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7244)|
| 2:00:45| to vent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| because all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7247)|
| 2:00:48| these other topics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7248)|
| 2:00:49| that we've kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| been contentious on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7250)|
| 2:00:51| up to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| are about community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| And the people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| live within those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| communities to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7258)|
| 2:00:59| what potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| the quality of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7260)|

| 2:01:02| look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| And let's be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| Lauren,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7266)|

| 2:01:08| the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7268)|
| 2:01:09| Black folk get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7269)|
| 2:01:10| and poor folk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7270)|
| 2:01:11| get taxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| Sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| that's the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| regressive tax there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7274)|

| 2:01:19| come on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| it's about who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7280)|
| 2:01:21| controls the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| and what programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7282)|
| 2:01:23| are instituted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| what the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| say that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230919?start=7285)|
