| 0:18:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| I want to start with a few facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| Just over one in ten American adults have diabetes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| Of these, approximately 7.3 are undiagnosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| One in three American adults is pre-diabetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| One and a half million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| The total cost of diagnosed diabetes in the United States in 2017 was approximately $327 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1112)|
| 0:18:44| The average cost of just one insulin pen that lasts maybe two to three weeks is about $120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1124)|
| 0:18:52| And both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can be diagnosed at any age and in people of every race, shape, and size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1132)|
| 0:19:02| And so I brought this resolution before us because November is Diabetes Awareness Month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1142)|
| 0:19:12| and World Diabetes Day was this past Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| I knew very little about this disease until September 23rd of this year when my 7-year-old daughter received a type 1 diagnosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1155)|
| 0:19:24| In this short amount of time, I have been introduced to the Biss family, the Langford family, the Chenot family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1164)|
| 0:19:32| the Pickard family, and several others who all have type 1 children of varying ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| This disease can happen to anyone at any time, even with no family history as is the case for my daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| The constant planning, precautions, sleepless nights, and worry that accompanies this disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| is an incredible burden for these families that they carry silently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| While there currently isn't a cure for diabetes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| I feel confident that with more awareness and education about the disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| one could be found in my daughter's lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| Please keep these warriors and their families in your thoughts and prayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| because they deal with much more than most people realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| With that, I would like to say thank you to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| for hosting a challenge between Mayor Jacobs and myself to raise awareness for diabetes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1223)|
| 0:20:35| And even though I won this year, I hope you will consider, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| redeeming yourself next year to another challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| And so with that, I will read the resolution before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1247)|
| 0:20:54| Whereas, originally launched by the World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation in 1991| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1254)|
| 0:21:01| in response to the rapid rise of diabetes around the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| World Diabetes Day is the primary global diabetes awareness campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| and celebrated in November's Diabetes Awareness Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| And whereas, today, 415 million people worldwide are living with diabetes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| a chronic, long-lasting health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| And whereas, though a significant number remain undiagnosed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| it is estimated that there are more than 34 million people with diabetes in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| 200,000 of whom are younger than 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| And whereas, diabetes occurs when a person's body doesn't create or use insulin properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| which leads to too much blood sugar in the bloodstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| and over time can cause serious health problems such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| And whereas, November is a time to refocus efforts to educate people about the risk factors and warning signs of diabetes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| recommit to fighting diabetes so that more people can lead healthy lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| and encourage engagement in regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and making nutritious food choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1329)|
| 0:22:17| And whereas, Knox County joins with the rest of the world in supporting those living with and fighting this disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| encouraging the families and friends who care for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| and applauding those researchers, advocates, and health care providers working to reduce the impact of this disease on the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| The Knox County Commission hereby recognizes November 2020 as Diabetes Awareness Month in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| and encourages all citizens to help fight diabetes and its devastating complications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1366)|

| 0:22:59| Be it further resolved that if any notifications are to be made to effectuate this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1379)|
| 0:23:06| then the county clerk is hereby requested to forward a copy of this resolution to proper authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1386)|

| 0:24:25| And I will turn it over to him at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1465)|

| 0:25:08| With the fire consuming the rest of the house, the crew closed the bedroom door and developed a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| They communicated to the fire attack teams outside the bedroom to make a path for them to bring the victim out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1514)|

| 0:27:28| to assess a difficult and dangerous situation involving a fire at the Casey home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| Now, therefore, I, Glenn Jacobs, Knox County Mayor, do hereby proclaim November 16, 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1653)|

| 0:27:57| We're not done yet. This is a pretty big deal for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| We're going to crown these two firefighters with what is known as the Civica Crown or the Civic Crown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1681)|
| 0:28:09| It was a military decoration during the Roman Empire, during the Roman Republic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| and the subsequent Principate regarded it as the second highest to which a citizen could aspire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| It took the form of a chaplet of common oak leaves woven to form a crown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| I'm not going to read all the history that goes with the award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| It was reserved for Roman citizens who saved the lives of fellow citizens by slaying an enemy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| on a spot held by that enemy on that same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| One of the most infamous, most famous persons to receive this award was Julius Caesar in 81 BC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| It is the highest award that we can give to a firefighter in the fire service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| With that, Mayor, if you will pin these two gentlemen with these pins, we'd be honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1729)|

| 0:30:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1850)|

| 0:31:58| From the fire prevention side, with our partnership with Knox County, we added two new educational videos to our YouTube fire media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| We had 9,640 views for the month, representing 911 hours of program time and logging 71,345 impressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1925)|
| 0:32:16| In addition, we had four in-person events with COVID precautions in place that had approximately 3,000 contacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| We also conducted eight virtual programs utilizing Skype and Zoom platforms that had approximately 300 contacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1942)|

| 0:33:08| Relocating from Bluegrass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| And North Knox County, the one off Corrington Road, which is relocating from David Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| With response to your questions last month about rural metro fire departments and questions that you had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=1995)|
| 0:33:23| we respond to 323 square miles of Knox County, the unincorporated parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| To your question of how Knox County Commission can help support the support levels go up in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| I believe Commissioner Smith asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| You can do a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| One is officially recognize the fire departments serving Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| That's all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| And encourage property owners, private and commercial property owners, to subscribe to the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| Second, you can politically encourage your state legislature to have Commerce and Insurance change their stance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| on rural metro fire as a subscription fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| And here's what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| They have stated that any property owners in Knox County can take full advantage of our ISO Class 3 classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2042)|
| 0:34:09| which saves them money on their insurance, their homeowner's insurance, that they take out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| And that regardless of whether or not they support the fire department, they can still take that advantage, take that luxury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2055)|
| 0:34:23| They have stated that rural metro fire is not a subscription fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| as that we still respond to emergencies of non-subscribers and then bill for service accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| We strongly disagree with that position as we feel like it's immoral and improper to quiz a 911 caller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| as far as whether or not they support the fire department rather than going to fight their fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| I believe Commissioner Biggs asked about some educational videos, and there are some up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| He did some on space heater safe operations and the proper use of Christmas lights and extension cords,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| which we hope everybody will heed those warnings as we go into that season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| I think that was all the questions you had from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Please remember that our fire stations are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| You're always welcome to stop by at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| Remember, we solve a lot of problems at the kitchen table and the coffee pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| So if you've got any other questions, I'll try my best to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| Jeff, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Explain to us what we need to do with the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| What is the—I didn't really follow what you were stating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Well, usually in the past, the Commerce and Insurance has mandated that to receive the Class III ISO certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2131)|
| 0:35:40| and to receive the subsequent savings in your homeowner's insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| you had to provide a copy of where you subscribed or were a member of the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| Commerce and Insurance held that up for a long time, and now they have changed their stance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| and they have now said that you don't have to worry about being a subscriber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| because they will respond no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| So they claim that we're not a subscription fire department, which we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| So really we need to pressure them from a political setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| and I believe Jason Zachary has been carrying that torch for us quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| I think that's one of the things on his agenda to do when they go back into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| But we need to get them to rethink that and reclassify it, if you will, for our benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| Because what that means is nobody should ever have to support the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| because they continue to get the Class III ISO rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| They can put that money in their pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| But in return, what that does for all of your fire departments in Knox County, Carnes and us as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| and Seymour's, if you don't support the fire department, they go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| That's just the way that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Thank you, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| I can see the point of the ISO III rating as a benefit to the consumer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| but why aren't the insurance companies pushing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Because they get hit with a large bill for the nonmember who they insure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| And that too falls in line, Commissioner, with what Commerce and Insurance does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| In the past, we have been able to take to task, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| insurance companies that don't abide by the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| But now when the rules are completely changed, nobody really has to abide by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| So we've got to go back and revisit that from a Commerce and Insurance position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| Thank you, Mr. Bagwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Since you have so many members of your team here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| and tonight was a special night honoring those who helped save a life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| and gave a lot in their service, if you'd like to bring everyone up for a group picture while our mayor is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| feel free to do that if you'd like to do that before you all depart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| If you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Yeah, if you would, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| Come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| They'll sound like a herd, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| They came to support their fellow brothers is what they did, and I think that's fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| And usually if you kind of come halfway up and face that way, then it's a lot easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| I know we have several members of our media here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| and the communications team would love to commemorate the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2283)|
| 0:38:11| We're going to move to 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2293)|
| 0:38:38| A little competition there, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| Anybody want me to take any pictures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| On your phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2330)|
| 0:39:08| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2348)|
| 0:39:32| Next we're going to move to item number 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| If you would read that into the record, and then I'll turn it over the mic to Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| This is a discussion item to recognize Three Ridges Golf Course for their job well done during the COVID-19 pandemic for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2379)|
| 0:39:47| Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| One of the things I want to talk about the Three Ridges Golf Course is not only what they've done through the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| and how they've opened up and had ways of taking activities out to where people can do it at a safe distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2398)|
| 0:40:06| because golf, you do, is an individual sport, and you do have distancing out there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| But the main thing was is how the public has come out there to use that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| And is Perry here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| How is our financials doing out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| This is the one that takes care of the money and tells us if we're doing good or bad out at the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2433)|
| 0:40:41| Yeah, Perry Benchoff, Knox County Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| Yeah, the financials at the golf course is the best we've had in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| More than 200% at times over the months, just for the amount of people that have frequencied the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2449)|
| 0:40:56| It's been really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| And the reason why I wanted him to come up to tell you something, just how we're doing out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| is that in the past we've been using the sheriff's office for some of the help out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| But since we've had this pandemic, they've not been able to use any of that help to offset some of the expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| on taking care of the golf course, but they're still bringing in a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| Thank you, Perry, for coming up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| I've got some other information I want to talk to you about this golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| When it brings good press, it's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| Golf Digest chief architect, his name was Thomas E. Clark, was here not too long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2489)|
| 0:41:36| and he was here to look at three different courses, and most of them was in Loudoun County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| Tokwa, Tanzi, Kehiti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| Those three golf courses, he was here looking at it for Golf Digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| And he writes this, and I want to read what he wrote about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| He says, looking at the golf courses, he said, I got to play Three Ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| And surprisingly, out of all four of the courses, including Three Ridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| Three Ridges was my favorite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| A surprise, I'm sure, especially given how poorly I played there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| But architecturally, I thought it contained absolutely the best set of holes we've played this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2528)|
| 0:42:16| I love the stretches 8 through 11 and 13 and 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| And he goes on down through here, and he said there was not a bad hole on the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| And he said it was kept up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| This is the best ambience of any venue with spectacular views of the mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2548)|
| 0:42:38| Hence the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| If this course had been maintained, provided like Tanzi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| it would have been a contender for the top 100 public courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| I kid you not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Alas, it is a public course maintained in public fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| I'm curious what kind of sort of shape it was in when the oweb.com nationwide tour event had been hosted here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2574)|
| 0:43:02| So it still has a very valuable thing on even a national scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| Now what does it do for the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| Non-profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| Between $500,000 and $600,000 are raised yearly on outings at Three Ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2594)|

| 0:43:50| Even Spark uses it to raise money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| There are things like leagues, especially for different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2634)|

| 0:44:14| And her name is Tammy Lauren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| And she runs a lot of kids events out there, teaching them what golf is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| and that you keep your own score and you do your own calling of penalties on yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| Trains them a lot out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2669)|

| 0:45:43| that pays for all of the Par 3 golf courses here in Knoxville where kids play free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| And that's part of what we raise out there at Three Ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2750)|
| 0:45:58| There's a lot more things on here that I would like to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| but the thing is you don't know how valuable that golf course is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| And I'll give you an example of personal things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| I see people coming in here, I met four guys that came in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| that were coming down from Chicago going down to Florida for their golf outing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2772)|
| 0:46:21| They stopped here on their way back from Florida| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| because they had some weather problems down there years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| And they stopped and somebody suggested they play Three Ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| Now, here's what those guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| They come from Chicago now, but they stop here on the way down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| and they play for a day and they go on to Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| And on the way back they stop and they play again because of that tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| And they talk about this golf course all over in their areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| It is a great ambassador for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| And one of these days I hope that we really take another look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| at some things that we do out there because it does bring us so much good press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| And it's done, and I'll mention his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| You probably will not talk to me anymore about this, but Mark Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| I've tried to get him here to recognize him and to give him this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| because he runs the place out there, gets it in the shape it's in, and works very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2831)|
| 0:47:18| But he doesn't want any credit for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| And you have people like that that work out there at that golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| And these are people that we should look at and say thank you for what you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| for our community and how you get us recognized not only locally but nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| And, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for giving me the time to talk about that golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| And I'm very proud to be on that golf course committee out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| And I just don't know how to talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| because it's the way the people feel about it that work out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| So thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| Thank you, Commission, for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2876)|

| 0:48:36| it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| which have connected them with one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2919)|

| 0:49:08| that to secure these rights, the governments are instituted among men,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2948)|

| 0:49:17| that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2961)|

| 0:49:28| and organizing its powers in such form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| as to then shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=2971)|

| 0:50:27| has violated the Sunshine Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| keeping the public out of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3029)|

| 0:50:34| and you cannot watch the reactions of each commissioner during the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| Mr. Jay last month arbitrarily cut off the video feed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3038)|

| 0:50:43| As was stated by Mr. Buchan in an email to a constituent last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| he violated the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| You are violating the Constitution by allowing an unelected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| unconstitutional board remain in effect due to fear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| in spite of the fact they are instilling this fear in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| A meeting with the board and or Ms. Buchanan must be scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| We have questions that demand answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3064)|

| 0:51:18| I'm going to finish this with a quote from Ron Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| former mayor of Newaygo, Michigan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| currently co-founder of Stand Up Michigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| I don't represent the people who come and complain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| to every city council meeting and the people who email me incessantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| I represent all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| And so I always had to look at that capacity and I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| But I also understand it is our obligation to not only follow the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| but what is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| And that means whether we are reelected or not reelected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| we have to stand up for the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| I'm Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3112)|

| 0:52:34| I appreciate the item on your agenda day 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| And in consistency with that item agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| I noted that you have altered it so that you're not asking in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| if it passes for addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| It's a tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| We've had people's property vandalized as you have your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| We've had people being whose neighbors have observed them being photographed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| in their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| That's why we don't give our addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| So I want to thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| Unfortunately, our culture has become coarse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| and we don't have the ability and the safety to stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| and proclaim our residences publicly out of fear of reprisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| So I'll begin with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| Two, the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| We have a serious problem with this body passing the buck of authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| and responsibility and decision-making to other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| When the chairman of this body was asked weeks ago by another citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| about the situation with the policies about this room and access to this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| the chairman said that you have to talk to the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| It's their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| It's not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Well, when you read their own literature about themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| which I will do for you now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| that is not what they say about the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| They say in regard to the PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3245)|
| 0:54:12| that the PBA develops public properties for the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| at their direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| These activities include construction management as the owner's representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3260)|
| 0:54:27| and are coordinated within the property development department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| Further on, it says the PBA is considered a political subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| of municipal corporation of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| So when we talk to them about the fact that government buildings have been exempted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| state buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| just said they're a municipal corporation that is a subdivision of TCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| So they're an entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| This building is a public building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| When an open meeting law says anywhere a meeting happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| it's deemed a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| So this building is by definition of you as the owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| and you all actually have the lion's share of the appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| to their board of directors, six compared to the city's five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| This building is exempted from that order because that order on the mass mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| says that it exempts public buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| So you all are the ones that need to make the decision about whether there's tape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| on these seats and how many people can come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| I understand there's fire code and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| If we have more people that want to come to this meeting than this room can handle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| it is not acceptable that simply there's a live feed somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| You've got to hold off your meeting and reschedule it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| because as was pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| some people don't have the ability to see your faces properly through a video feed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| and 90% of communication is nonverbal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| So if you can't see, like I have no idea if I'm being smirked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| by the people wearing masks right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| I don't know if they're pleased with what I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| or unhappy with what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| So I'm glad you now have the plexiglass shields that make it safe for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| to remove your masks so that I can properly understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| what's being communicated to me by you as representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| But yet again, here the point is the fact that, well, it's the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| It's their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| No, that language that's on their own website says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| they're an entity that represents your interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| and this building belongs jointly to the county and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| not some arbitrary entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| There is some talk about a lease that's a 50-year lease, lease to own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| so we need to get that figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| Figure it out for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| But that's what they say about themselves on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| So we're asking you to not continue being a body that kicks the can and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| unelected body, make the decisions for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| We don't want the responsibility of that decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| We're asking our elected officials to stand up and take the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| of being the decision makers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| How many more times and how many more issues do you plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| to kick the can to an unelected body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| Mr. Vernon Henry, if you would please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3447)|
| 0:57:35| Vernon Henry, 37922 Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| Full disclosure once again, not related to any of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| not related to anybody on the health board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| The questions we should be asking, Mr. Larson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| I made some references last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| How many of you guys are Erics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| And you know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| Just to raise a hand, I know this is not a really interactive aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| but how many of you looked at any peer reviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| looked at any of the information I've been bringing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| and saw these other people to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Anybody at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| One nodding head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| The rest of you are asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| I just had a very, very sad conversation no more minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| A client of mine, mother's in hospice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| They won't let two family members in to see her in hospice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| because she might get COVID and die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| There is a little humor somewhere behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| I'm just not sure where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| We've talked about authority and responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| You have got a health director who sits on a health board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| making rule and regulation for which she has no responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| and all the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| And you keep giving it to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| Now, I've had some wonderful conversations with a couple of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| and you know who I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| But the reality is you keep doing the same damn thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| and nothing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| And it irritates us, and it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| It should irritate you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| The health board just gave you guys the finger a couple days ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| and said we don't have to have interaction with the public anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| because we're not going to have any more meetings to the public anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| We don't have to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| We don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| This woman is getting ready to lock down the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| You know it, and if you don't know it, you're lying to yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| Hospitals have just announced privately to their staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| they're not going to be doing any more elective surgeries come Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| How many more people in this damn county are going to get sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| are going to have issues that will not be seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| because we're going to lock down for something that has a 99.97% recovery rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3590)|
| 0:59:58| because we now have the Nov 5, 2020 cure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| that has a guesstimate of a 94.5% effective rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3602)|
| 1:00:10| None of you looked up the daggone numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| Again, 99.97% recovery rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| If you went to the hospital in April, you had a 25.6% chance of dying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| because they were putting you on a respirator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3623)|
| 1:00:29| Seventy-four percent of the people who are put on a ventilator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| never come off the daggone ventilator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| That's not a secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| You go into the hospital today, you have a 6.7% chance of dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| Once again, quit telling me who's going into the hospital because of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| or excuse me, with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| Tell me who's going in because of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| Don't tell me who's dying with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| Tell me who's died because of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| If you don't believe that she's going to lock this area down again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| you are sadly mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| How many more small businesses are you going to allow to be run out of business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| Now, we have been asking, and you know who we've been asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| for a public open forum to speak with the health director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| You guys are paying her $198,000 a year to supply you with answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| You're not getting the answers, and neither are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| We've asked, when are you going to quit doing this stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| We don't have an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| Her answer is whatever skid mark pouch she tells her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| I'm upset with you guys, if you haven't noticed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| This is going back to that alien movie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| Sigourney Weaver thinks she got away from the aliens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| We're waiting for it to pop out of the stomach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| I'm waiting for it to pop out of the stomach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| Please start paying attention to us because the reality is that you guys are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3721)|
| 1:02:09| and you should be because bad things are going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3729)|

| 1:02:15| You asked a couple days ago, Mr. Smith, we have 470,000 people in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3735)|
| 1:02:22| She's getting 850,000 doses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| You asked, is she going to have a mandated vaccination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| She said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Why the hell would you buy 850,000 doses with a 30-day shelf life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3750)|
| 1:02:36| if you don't plan to mandate something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| And how she's going to get around it, and you're going to let her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| is she's going to put pressure on the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| I know my time's up, but I'll finish with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| I need, we want, we require whatever you would like to paraphrase it as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3768)|
| 1:02:56| We want your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| We want answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| We deserve answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| Thank you, Mr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| Elizabeth Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| I believe Dr. Buchanan said they were going to buy 850 doses the first round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| Could you join us at the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| I'm sorry, so we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| Please state your name and department for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3806)|
| 1:03:34| Mark Buchanan, Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| The first, the Pfizer vaccine, will be distributed in boxes that contain 975 doses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3817)|
| 1:03:46| You can't buy, you can't get less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| You can't get, I mean, you can get two boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| At this time, we plan on buying a single box and seeing what the uptake is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| because we don't know what the uptake is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| We'll see who wants to have the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| Again, following the priorities from the State Department of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| and CDC and seeing who's willing to take the vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| and we don't know what that number is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| Elizabeth Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| If you would please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3858)|
| 1:04:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| Elizabeth Murphy, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| I'm Carson Daly's constituent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| I couldn't hear what Dr. Buchanan said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| It's very hard to hear up here at times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| but thank you, Dr. Buchanan, for correcting any misinformation we may have received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| Kevin mentioned how you've been kicking the can down the road when it comes to PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| I can't tell you how many people want to come to this, but they don't want to sign up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| They're like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| They don't like public speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| And PBA doesn't let them in the building unless they're on the list to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| How is that not in violation of Sunshine Law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| We have not pushed that issue because, frankly, I don't really want to waste my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| constantly battling every little thing that comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| and my main focus is next legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| I mentioned last week that Senator Briggs will most likely kill Zachary's bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| Case in point is an email that he sent to a constituent that I will now read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| I'm strongly opposed and continue to be to Representative Zachary's bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| He had a nearly identical bill presented in June during the legislative session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| that I personally killed in the Senate State and Local Government Committee, which I chaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| It is a dangerous bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| During a health emergency, we need the resources of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| and the best medical experts available to save lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| Every county mayor does not need to be the final medical authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| for public health decisions during a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| I appreciate so much your concern and want to assure you that this is a dangerous matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| which needs to be defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| Did you hear the language there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| He took pride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| He personally defeated that bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| It is a dangerous matter which needs to be defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| If you all are counting on the state legislature to take care of an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| that should be handled here at a county level, then why are you in office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| Why do you continue to roll your eyes at us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| Because I know most of you are tired of being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| I don't want to be here anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| I feel like the only way to reach a conclusion that is amenable to all parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| and I know you see the same about ten faces up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| please know there are literally thousands backing us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| that just don't want to show up for their own reasons, but they are here behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| The only way I see to bring this to any sort of conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| beyond the state legislature taking care of it, which I have very little faith in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| because if they did, it would be months and months until that went into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| is for us to have a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| Dr. Buchanan is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| She could sit up here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| We could have a discourse with her after the meeting was over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| We could set that up for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| We could set it up where everybody is at a business that we find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| We can socially distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| I would even wear a mask for this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| I don't know what else to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| You are our leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| We have voted you in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Please help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| That's all we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| We want to know what are the criteria that need to be in place for the mask mandate to end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| because right now we are not given those metrics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| and I don't believe she even has those metrics in her mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| Patty King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| If you would, please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| My name is Patty King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| I live on Tipton Station, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| I've spoken with Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| He does know my address by heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| So what I'd like to say is I'd like to talk to you all as being a medical-exempt person with this mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4039)|
| 1:07:30| And please excuse me because I'm extremely nervous talking in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4050)|
| 1:07:36| I'm not sure if you are aware of the fact that the Health Department is encouraging people to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| and report the people that are not masked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| That has been going on since the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| I have been stalked by people in public numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| My picture has been taken numerous times by masked people in stores in South Knoxville and up here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4076)|
| 1:08:06| This mask mandate is not only unconstitutional, but it is unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| When you're wearing your mask, we don't know what you guys are thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| We don't know why you're following us through the stores and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4096)|
| 1:08:27| Stores are just doing it because of my normal face showing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| Or if they are doing it, if they're following me, planning more serious offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4113)|
| 1:08:39| I am a young woman that lives in South Knoxville, and I love living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4119)|
| 1:08:46| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| Carson knows that I love my area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| But there are people in that area that I will not deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| And when they're wearing masks, it scares me because I can't see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| Stores are also not honoring the mandate that states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| except for those who have medical exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| And we can give you store names that are giving us a hard time because we have them in our group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4147)|
| 1:09:13| We as residents of Knox County should not be banned from stores just because we cannot wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4153)|
| 1:09:20| I wore a mask at the beginning of COVID-19 because of my health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| I almost passed out every single time I wore one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| People are getting sick from having to wear a mask all day while they're working or shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4171)|
| 1:09:38| More people are getting sinus infections and other issues due to masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| My mother works at a Walmart, has to wear that mask for eight hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| She has major health issues now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| I know personally a dozen people that have caught COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| You know what they all have in common?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| They all follow all the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| They've worn masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| They have social distance, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| But the ones up here that don't wear masks, most of us have not caught this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| Yes, I know some that have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| But most have not caught this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| So what is this telling you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| The masks don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| Now in my last minute, I'd like to speak to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| At the end of last month's meeting, you came out of the meeting in such a rush, in a huff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| that if I had not been paying attention, you would have knocked me off the stairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| You could have hurt me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| You were upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| That's no reason to storm out of the room and potentially hurt somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| You pushed through a group of our people talking to a commissioner downstairs last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4246)|
| 1:10:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| I have shown you guys nothing but respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| And I know our group is loud, but we also try to show you guys respect, and we ask the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| Phil King, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4268)|
| 1:11:15| Phil King, Knox County, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| And Carson Daly is my commissioner as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| So I want to do a follow-up for my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| I want you to know that it took a lot for her to come up here and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| It took a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| She's never done anything like this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| I want to talk to you about a little bit different area on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4293)|
| 1:11:39| Commissioner Bussler, I know last month this was something that you were very concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| and you all need to be very, very concerned about what's happening to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| Eight years ago, my wife and I decided to move here from New Mexico.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| We moved here in no small part because of the friendly reputation that Knox County has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4313)|
| 1:12:01| And up until now, we've not regretted it any minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| In fact, I can tell you this, that I have bragged the whole time that I've been here to people all over the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| to family and friends all over the country, that of all the places that we have lived, that I have lived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| I have never felt more at home than here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| But I'm sad to say that that has stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| Because of the way that all of the elected officials here in Knox County have reacted to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4345)|
| 1:12:34| the way that the city has reacted to it and have actually encouraged people in the Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| to have encouraged people to snitch on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| They have repeatedly pitted resident against resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| And now a growing body of people, of residents in this community, have organized together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| I'm going to tell you right now there are multiple groups on social media with thousands of members of Knox County citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4373)|
| 1:12:59| with the one thing in mind, that is to stalk us, to take our picture, and to dox us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4379)|
| 1:13:08| Thousands of people are involved in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| Social media has demonized us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| And there are even people who are calling us bioterrorists now from our friendly Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4395)|
| 1:13:23| You're starting to get a bad reputation, and it's spreading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| And I'm going to tell you right now, I have friends in other states that are starting to ask me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| they're hearing about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| Is this really what you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| It's gotten so bad that we now for the last few months are doing most of our business down in Monroe County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4413)|
| 1:13:41| Now, I'm a small business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| And I can guarantee you, I know that my business is probably small potatoes to the rest of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| but how many small potatoes are you willing to let go and run out of here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4429)|
| 1:13:55| And you're all complicit in this, and let me tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| Because unless I'm mistaken, and you correct me if I'm wrong, unless I'm mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| not a single one of you have publicly spoken out against this kind of behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| not to your constituents or anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| Now, this makes me really sad because I had planned to retire here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| and now we're contemplating very seriously whether or not we can stay in this kind of environment that's been created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| And I will tell you one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| That should scare you far more, what's happening to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| and that should scare you far more than a virus with a 99% recovery rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| Daryl Ann Cummings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| Daryl Ann Cummings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| Hi, Daryl Ann Cummings, 6640 Grace Nicely Lane, Coryton, Tennessee, 37721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4493)|
| 1:15:00| I'm here tonight because to get into the building I had to sign up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| And I am way over my head and out of my league.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| I am a homeschool mom, and I never have put my foot into this political water before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4509)|
| 1:15:16| And I feel like it is at a point where I cannot sit back and watch these things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| And I am thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| A blessing that has come from this is that I have been awakened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| and I enjoy the e-mails, the conversations that I've had with many of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| I enjoy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| I'm learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| I'm learning what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| And I know that there are thousands of people like me that are scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| I just wanted to come and sit tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| I didn't want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| I just wanted to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| I watched at home last week, and it's not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| It's not the same watching it on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| I wanted to sit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| I wanted to be with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| I wanted you to see my face and hear my shaky voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| So I'm here to remind you that just because we're not here every week reminding you that we want to take care of dissolving the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| that that's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| We need to take care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| It's unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| We've come to that conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| I also have been in contact with my other legislators about Zachary's bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4569)|
| 1:16:14| and I have gotten the same responses that Mrs. Murphy has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| Briggs wrote me almost the exact same thing, word for word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| And passing the buck isn't going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| We've got to do something here with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| And I know a lot of us are willing to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| We want a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| If you can figure out a way that we can have a conversation with the Board of Health, I'm telling you now that will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4594)|
| 1:16:41| When people email you, respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| Talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| Ensure us that things are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4604)|
| 1:16:52| Okay, so Board of Health, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| Now I'm going to change topics because there's also a big thing that many of you have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| And you went to a training seminar with the Environmental Health Trust about 5G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| And that is also a big deal, and there's a lot of people that are concerned about the safety of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| And I want you to consider, I think there's new commissioners that didn't get to go to that seminar, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| I think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| I would like you to inform yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| Look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| There's some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| A friend of mine will be sending me some information that I plan to send to you to also look into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| because I am concerned about the safety and our house property values and other things of the sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| So I appreciate all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4653)|

| 1:18:10| HB 2279 was written by two lobbyists from AT&T and Verizon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4690)|
| 1:18:17| and signed into law by Governor Bill Haslam in 2018 without our knowledge or consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4697)|
| 1:18:25| It strips our local government, you all, from the ability to protect Knoxville residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4705)|
| 1:18:34| from the irresponsible placement of these wireless facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| No one is measuring the radiation emitting from the existing towers now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| to see if they are functioning within FCC guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| No one is required to measure the radiation coming from the upcoming cell towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| and antennas that will be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| The Knoxville Wireless Communication Facility Ordinance and Small Cell Guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4742)|
| 1:19:12| Has anyone here viewed that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| It's online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| It's the Knoxville Wireless Communication Facility Ordinance and Small Cell Guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| It was presented by Jeff Archer from the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| And it shows pictures of small cell antennas in places like waste baskets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| under benches, at bus stops, concealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| So what am I asking for today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| I'm asking that Knox County would adopt, if you don't want this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| if you want the control of our local officials, you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| to control and regulate the placement of these facilities for the welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| for the safety and the property values of Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| I'm asking for a resolution to be presented and voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| I know it won't change anything, the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| but at least it will say that you all want to regulate these again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| That was given to our local government in the Telecommunications Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| It was stripped away by HB 2279.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| And just to say you want it back would help Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| And I'm asking for a resolution to be written and voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| The other thing I'm asking for that we can do, I'm asking that you will do, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| I have a copy for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| Are you allowed to get a copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| After your remarks, you can give that to our staff over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| I can, but it would be good for you to see it while I speak, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| I think by the time you finish it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| Go ahead and finish your remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| What this is, is I'm asking for, I'm asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| respectfully asking that you would inform Knox County residents of the wireless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| facilities that are coming in by providing map locations online through the Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4876)|
| 1:21:25| It would show the 4G, 5G, small cell tower and antenna applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| So you could go on and see an interactive map of where these applications are if you're a resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| And then you could also see another map of cell towers and antennas that have been installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4897)|
| 1:21:45| So you're just informing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| There's no law that needs to be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| I don't even think it would cost any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| And I have an example from a community in California, Oak Grove, a town called Elk Grove, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4911)|
| 1:21:59| And I have the link on here, so you can actually type that in and I can e-mail that to you tomorrow as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4919)|
| 1:22:07| You can see their interactive map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| And it included information like the street, city street light number, who licensed it, like AT&T, Verizon, the street name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4929)|
| 1:22:19| the nearest cross street, the location, the nearest address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| You would be providing our residents with at least the knowledge of where these are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4943)|
| 1:22:31| And so I would respectfully ask that you would provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| I don't see anything that could prevent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| So a resolution and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| And also I would encourage you all to review online the Knox County Zoning Ordinance that was done in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4964)|
| 1:22:52| It was actually very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| I know, Law Director Buick, you've probably seen this, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| But it was pretty good where we could do some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| So I'd like you to view that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| That's what was taken away from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| You can give the papers to the team over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4986)|
| 1:23:14| Commissioner Skimnaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| Commissioner Daley, was that the thing that Jeff Archer did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| Is that where you and I went to the public meeting that was over at the YMCA next to the CAC building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5003)|
| 1:23:31| Was that about three years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| Wasn't that when we went over there and listened to that presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| Yeah, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| And if I'm not mistaken, didn't they come and give a presentation to us also at commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| Does anybody else remember that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| I know they came to our homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| They will go out to the homeowners group and present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| Yes, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5032)|

| 1:38:57| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| First by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| So I've read over this a couple times and looking at what was previously there and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| we're replacing it with, I think there's some of the things that kind of throw up a red flag to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| One of them is being one thing that we heard tonight and we've talked about it in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| about people feeling comfortable with maybe giving their address to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5963)|
| 1:39:29| the Commission Office and not having to state it on the live feed, as well as other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5969)|
| 1:39:36| I mean, I'm all for trying to do whatever we can to make sure we streamline the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| that everyone's voices are heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| But at the same time, I think we need to realize that just because we're in the middle of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| pandemic that maybe amending these at this specific moment may not be in the best interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5986)|
| 1:39:50| of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| My only comment was that this says Knox County citizens, and I just had the comment that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=5998)|
| 1:40:06| should be citizens and property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| If you live outside the county, but own a property in the county, you should be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| to come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| If we're passing stuff on taxes and things like that, they're going to affect your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| I do believe that our rules state that anyone that calls in to DRU can give their address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6026)|
| 1:40:34| and they don't have to publicly speak their address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| If I can jump in, it does say here in the rule changes, information required for public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6040)|
| 1:40:46| forum registration, which is, I'll back up, individuals or groups seeking to address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| commission during public forum should register by contacting the commission office via telephone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| or email no later than 4 p.m. on the day prior to the scheduled meeting, or by speaking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| the commission vice chair in person prior to the start of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| Information required for public forum registration will include name, contact information, address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| and topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| The chair may also, chair or a commissioner may also recognize individuals and not a right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6069)|
| 1:41:16| to speak beforehand if they determined if such in the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| So essentially what is changed is currently the rules say that you are supposed to, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| you come to public forum, you're supposed to give your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| This changes to when you sign up to provide your name and address to the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| and then when you speak, it only asks that you give up your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| So it provides the name and address for the record, but it does not do it in this public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6099)|
| 1:41:45| forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6105)|
| 1:41:45| It does it to the commission office in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| That is the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| Yes, and so come the December meeting, no public person will have to give their address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6108)|
| 1:41:54| publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| Correct, but they will have to provide it to the commission office when they sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| Uh, this was when you and I were on the rules committee back in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| This was our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| This is nothing new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| We were going to do this in March, and it should have been done in March, but a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| of things happened in March called COVID, and it should have been separated, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| had it all together in one rules forum committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| Everything's the same here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| Maybe just a few more things added, but nothing has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| Public forums still, public will still get to see, do public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| Uh, agenda items will be first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| There's nothing, there's nothing new that we're trying to do to try to, to hinder public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6154)|
| 1:42:39| forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| That's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| Public forum will always be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| We will sit, I will sit here and listen to you until the last person is heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| So, uh, the answer Commissioner Biggs is, uh, the question, no, nothing's new on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| This is, uh, this should have been done in March, but COVID happened and we postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| it, and we only brought it up when we started meeting again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| So, I am fully in favor of these new rule changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| Just addressing, uh, Commissioner Ward's comment about, um, uh, having people be residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6189)|
| 1:43:16| of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| There is a provision in there where the chair can certainly allow folks to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6198)|
| 1:43:24| And I will just tell you when we were discussing this in rules committee, it was, uh, for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6204)|
| 1:43:29| purpose of preventing public forum, forum from being commandeered by people outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6209)|
| 1:43:35| of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| Um, there, we have not seen it here, but there are, there are places where busloads of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6216)|
| 1:43:43| come in from other areas intentionally to disrupt meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6223)|
| 1:43:48| And we just wanted to have a, a barrier up to protect ourselves from those outside of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6228)|
| 1:43:55| Knox County, um, taking over a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| It's just, if I own property in other counties, I'd like to be able to represent my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6239)|
| 1:44:05| if there's taxes being voted on or things like that, they're going to affect my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| in particular, or, you know, roads being built, whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| Uh, I understand that the chair can have them come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| That's, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| I'm just wanting to voice my opinion that, that, that is a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| I will point out one other thing that, uh, one of the lines in here that says that any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| the chair or commissioner or a commissioner may also recognize individuals who have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| arranged to speak beforehand if they're determined such as in the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| So we did talk in the rules committee about three or four safeguards to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| Commissioner Beeler and then Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| Um, I wanted to say I do agree with Commissioner Ward, uh, the spirit behind what he's saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6285)|
| 1:44:51| about property owners, uh, should be able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| Uh, but I also agree with Commissioner Daley, and I just wanted to state that for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| that I, I've read over this multiple times since it was presented, and I don't believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| this is intended in any way to limit public forum any further than it's already, uh, limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6302)|
| 1:45:10| Um, in fact, it, it, the spirit behind it is to actually give greater opportunity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6310)|
| 1:45:16| more speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| Uh, the only substantive changes really are the positioning of public forum and, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| segregation of agenda items versus non-agenda items, which I think is perfectly reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| Um, putting the, there's always been latitude as, as to time limits for speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6327)|
| 1:45:35| Even the previous rules, five minutes is not, not a, not a written in stone, uh, time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6335)|
| 1:45:43| limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6343)|
| 1:45:43| And just giving that three to five minute latitude, that's important because we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| the possibility of 40 to 50 speakers signing up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| And if, if we're not able to somewhat limit the time of each speaker, uh, then there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6351)|
| 1:45:58| going to be people that have to go home before they get a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| Uh, the attention span of this body is not going to be what it needs to be at 1.30 in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| Uh, and not, that's not to mention the staff that, that, that has to stay here for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| that length of time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| So I think those are reasonable things too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| Um, and the truth of the matter is that the chair has always been charged with maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6374)|
| 1:46:21| decorum in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| And this simply puts language in the rules to, to further protect and allow the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6388)|
| 1:46:28| So I would support the resolution of the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| Uh, to address some of the concerns about the property owners that a few of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| have, I, I, I would offer this up for discussion as a friendly amendment with the simple language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| change on the line that says the, the commission public forum is primarily designated for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6403)|
| 1:46:51| County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| And you could add the words and property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| Mr. Commissioner Hill, would you take that as a friendly amendment to your motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6414)|
| 1:47:01| approve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6421)|
| 1:47:01| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| Be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| Commissioner Busser, would you take that as a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| Yes, as a second that this would have to go back through the rules committee to add to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| it, or we can do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| We can do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| It's not a substitute, substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| There's a motion to approve with that friendly amendment of adding and land owner, uh, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| Citizens and property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| And that would be recognized in the final language that then would be codified and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| used in the beginning in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6457)|

| 1:56:18| Let's do a motion and a second to get it open for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6984)|
| 1:56:24| Oh, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| You don't have to have a motion on the floor to have discussion in zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| Oh, you don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| Anyway, sorry about that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| Would you like to add some context to this project, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| Yes, if I could, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| I was actually at my own fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| I missed the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| I thought I knew how to do the Zoom and was unable to connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| I had called MPC and asked them what the status was of this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| and they said it was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| And I failed to ask any further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7016)|
| 1:56:59| So I assumed that it was going to be the consent at 5 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7019)|
| 1:57:05| And so anyway, much to my surprise, it was on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| but the recommendation was for 2 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| So that's the reason I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| What I would like to request is that you all would consider upping to PR3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7033)|
| 1:57:19| I had originally asked for PR5, and I have the property across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7039)|
| 1:57:25| and then I'm fixing to close on the rest of the property across the street next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| So it's all zoned PR5 directly across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| This property also adjoins the new shod road extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| because that area is growing so fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| So it's within the area where PR5 is obviously allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7061)|
| 1:57:48| and I'm only asking for 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| So my request today would be if I could increase it from 2 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7070)|
| 1:57:55| And to my knowledge, there's no opposition or has not been any opposition from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7075)|
| 1:58:01| Discussion? Open for discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| Mr. Worley called me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| I actually met him out on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| This is a single strip of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7092)|
| 1:58:16| I did feel his pain when he was trying to get on Zoom and was not able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7096)|
| 1:58:23| We all certainly understand that in these times, those types of last minute issues can occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7103)|
| 1:58:32| The difference in the request of 3 to 2, from 2 to 3, I believe Mr. Worley was 2 more homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7112)|
| 1:58:43| It's 3 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7123)|
| 1:58:44| Well, let me rephrase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7124)|
| 1:58:45| It's 5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| So 2 would be 10 and 3 would be up to 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7130)|
| 1:58:51| But how many are you actually thinking you'll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| Well, my plan is to build 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| All right, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| I'm very comfortable with this 3 per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| especially given the fact that it is totally surrounded by 5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| So would you like to put that into form of a loan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7148)|
| 1:59:08| I would like to propose that we approve this with 3 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7148)|
| 1:59:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7154)|
| 1:59:14| Second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7154)|

| 1:59:19| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7164)|

| 2:02:21| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| up to 4 dwelling units per acre by vote of 14-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7348)|
| 2:02:29| Mr. Mullins, is there anything you'd like to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| Just briefly, I sent an email out to everyone explaining the kind of the procedure of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7353)|
| 2:02:40| this is different than the prior application that was before this body earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7360)|
| 2:02:45| There was opposition to this request at the Planning Commission stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| I don't know if there's opposition here tonight yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7369)|
| 2:02:53| I hope there isn't because we've done a good job actually reaching out to the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7373)|
| 2:02:58| since the rezoning was recommended by Planning Commission, working with them on their concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| accessing, making sure we have access off Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| We've even filed for a concept plan approval with the Planning Commission, kind of laying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| out what our lots are going to look like and what the access could look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| Of course, that's subject to Planning Commission's approval and could change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| but we're trying to be good neighbors and work with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7398)|
| 2:03:21| I didn't ask, but I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7401)|
| 2:03:23| I see there is opposition here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| If you give them a chance to speak as well, then I may call on you, Mr. Mullins, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7404)|
| 2:03:30| If you would, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| Sorry, I didn't ask for your identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7415)|
| 2:03:36| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7416)|
| 2:03:36| I'm a familiar face here anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7416)|
| 2:03:39| Please state your name and address for the record, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| My name is Julie Korn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| I reside in the Karnes community off Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| Well, we're here again for round three about the Smithville development at 5913 West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7427)|
| 2:03:55| Good morning, good afternoon, everyone, and Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| This was already debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| This has been voted on two different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| The only thing different this go-around is Mr. Smith made another application to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| MPC, which it was approved, that added the commercial property onto the property that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| was already denied in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7453)|
| 2:04:17| And the most major thing that we have found out is Mr. Smith and his attorneys have filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7457)|
| 2:04:23| a lawsuit against the county because they were denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| So those are the two things that have brought us back here for the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7467)|
| 2:04:33| And needless to say, I hate that for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| I hate it for all of us that we keep trying to rectify the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7476)|
| 2:04:41| We did meet with Rocky and Josh Smith at our neighborhood meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7481)|
| 2:04:47| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| Please note that we had previously asked to meet with them with no response, but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7489)|
| 2:04:54| time was a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| They did show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| We were given, and I passed out the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| There's three pages to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| If you look at that real quickly, it says best case scenario should be page one, worst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7502)|
| 2:05:07| case scenario should be page two, and the most likely scenario will be page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7507)|
| 2:05:13| If they're out of order, I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| But anyway, when we got these, we looked at something that was very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7515)|
| 2:05:20| On page one and page two, the language that is put on that form and was given needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7520)|
| 2:05:29| know facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| TDOT has approved access to West Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7531)|
| 2:05:38| Once again, it's on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| That's the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| And even on the third page, it says need to know facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| TDOT has approved access to West Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7545)|
| 2:05:49| To our knowledge, after contacting the state and Knox County, there has not been any access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7549)|
| 2:05:55| that has been granted to anyone from that address for an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7555)|
| 2:06:01| I talked with a gentleman that said, I'm the one that reviews them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| There's not been anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| I talked to another gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| Nope, haven't done anything, haven't seen anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| So I'm not sure where that lies, but it doesn't look very transparent to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7571)|
| 2:06:20| The next thing is, there was a opportunity for Mr. Smith and Mr. Sanderson to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7580)|
| 2:06:31| the community and tell them that that property could be, quote, the property that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7591)|
| 2:06:37| talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7597)|
| 2:06:38| And for those that are new that have not been voted in yet, I don't know if you all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| been given the 9-1-1 on that, but that piece of property seemed to be a huge discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7603)|
| 2:06:51| the stubbed off property, which Mr. Fraser said in a meeting back in June and July, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7611)|
| 2:06:57| property was his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| So anyway, or him and the other two neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| So anyway, we come to an email that was given to us by Mr. Sanderson, and it states about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7624)|
| 2:07:14| middle ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7634)|
| 2:07:15| After discussing this idea, he wanted to take that little sliver of property, because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7635)|
| 2:07:20| was the biggest problem with Northampton Commons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7640)|
| 2:07:24| They didn't want the traffic, they didn't want the brunt of this neighborhood coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| through an already developed neighborhood that has been there since 1970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7648)|
| 2:07:33| There have been original owners of that property still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| They said they will move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| So you're going to disrupt a whole community, a whole neighborhood for a new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| that sits 50 feet from this stubbed off property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| We have been told that the attorney for Mr. Smith, Mr. Sanderson, Primo, Smithfield, whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7667)|
| 2:07:55| you want to call them, they couldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7675)|
| 2:07:59| I've never known an owner of a piece of property not to be able to do what they want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7679)|
| 2:08:05| with their property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| It has to be greater than, and it's highlighted, it's probably not on your aws, the land being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7687)|
| 2:08:15| less than five acres would have to adhere to the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7695)|
| 2:08:19| This is not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| So you can't deed that property off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| You can't give it to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| You can't give it to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| They're on the corner where this entrance and exit from proposed neighborhood is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7708)|
| 2:08:32| to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7712)|
| 2:08:33| I mean, I've never heard about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| Granted, I don't have a degree in land and all of that stuff, but that just, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7715)|
| 2:08:42| know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7722)|
| 2:08:42| That just doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| I don't know that that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| So anyway, we're back to square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| Your pieces of paper, page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| Worst case scenario, most likely case scenario, likely makes us connect to Patriot's Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7732)|
| 2:09:01| They're still asking to come through Patriot's Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| They're not going to get, and Mr. Snowden may want to speak to this, we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| this before in the meeting in July when it got voted down, no access from TDOT onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7750)|
| 2:09:21| onto West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| The speed limit on Emory Road is 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| Correct me if I'm wrong in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| You have to have at least 400 feet clearance to be able to have a line of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7770)|
| 2:09:36| There is not 400 feet of clearance because on that corner where Blacksberry comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7776)|
| 2:09:43| which would be great for them to access the property, but guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| In Carnes, that's another little bitty rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| County road that two people cannot pass on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7790)|
| 2:09:54| So, you can't use Blacksberry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7794)|
| 2:09:59| The only viable option, unless, I don't know, something strikes TDOT and they pull something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7799)|
| 2:10:06| out, I'm not sure, is to come through Patriot's Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7806)|
| 2:10:11| Period, dot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| There's no other option for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7813)|
| 2:10:16| I did talk to TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| I'm telling you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7818)|
| 2:10:19| I've got the emails on my phone and the text messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| Don't mind to share that with you personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| If you want those documents, I'd be more than happy to send them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7824)|
| 2:10:28| Mr. Chairman, you were not the chairman yet when this came before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7828)|
| 2:10:35| You sit right over here where Mr. Biggs is sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7835)|
| 2:10:38| You yourself even stated this is a bad piece of property, and I'm paraphrasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7838)|
| 2:10:46| I may have the verbiage a little bit off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| Sometimes pieces of property are bad pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7853)|
| 2:10:54| That's not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| It got denied because of the road conditions where all this traffic is going to funnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7857)|
| 2:11:02| out of Patriot Way onto Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| Well, guess what we've got at the end of Carpenter Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| Carpenter Road, Harrell Road, and West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7867)|
| 2:11:12| Mr. Snowden made comment that that area is already a high impact crash area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7872)|
| 2:11:20| That has been identified by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| So now what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| We're going to take all those cars from Northampton Commons, if they come down, onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7886)|
| 2:11:31| Emory from the other entrance and exit, Northampton Boulevard, and add that to an already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7891)|
| 2:11:38| messed up intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| That is supposed to be worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7900)|
| 2:11:44| It's supposed to be by the meeting we had in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7904)|
| 2:11:50| Let me get my date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7910)|
| 2:11:51| Just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| Please don't cut me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| I didn't really set a timer, so I'm going to do my best to try to give you equal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7915)|
| 2:11:59| I'll hate the other people that didn't respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| I'll take their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| Just do your best to consolidate your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7922)|

| 2:12:07| At minute 2844 on the tape from July, Mr. Snowden was asked if anything had been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7927)|
| 2:12:15| initiated with the intersection of Carpenter, Harrell, and West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7935)|
| 2:12:19| His answer, and I paraphrase, plants have been made, money has been granted from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7939)|
| 2:12:23| last budget that we just passed here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| The start, the acquisition process, the appraisal, we're going to begin it in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7947)|
| 2:12:33| Have you ever known TDOT to begin an action on time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7953)|
| 2:12:38| Mr. Jay, you even made comment to that last go-around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| If it's TDOT, if it's the state involved, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| There's always a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7964)|
| 2:12:45| They never get started on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| So, and it's supposed to be finished in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7968)|
| 2:12:53| Not the first piece of dirt has been moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| Not the first blade of grass has been removed or excavated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7976)|
| 2:13:01| I've talked to the owner of the business that's supposed to be demolished, and I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| talked to the house owner that is supposed to be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| They've received nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| So, for me to believe that this is going to be started and completed in a year, I, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7993)|
| 2:13:19| I just, I can't, I just can't buy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=7999)|
| 2:13:23| Oh, Lord have mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8003)|
| 2:13:28| Let's see, what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| And I mentioned that Mr. Jay had made the comment about the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| All right, please listen, and I'm not trying to be flip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| I'm not trying to be threatening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8016)|
| 2:13:38| I'm just telling you like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| Northampton Commons, if this is approved for the third time, will grunt the weight of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8022)|
| 2:13:50| so-called development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| No doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8032)|
| 2:13:53| No questions asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| There is to be no negative effect in the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8035)|
| 2:13:59| It is to, quote, fit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| That's from the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| That's not being followed, especially here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8044)|
| 2:14:07| The community already has major safety road issues in multiple places and the large number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8047)|
| 2:14:14| of residents in a very small, compact area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8054)|
| 2:14:18| We feel like we're in a can like sardines already because of the issues we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8058)|
| 2:14:24| The population and the lack of infrastructure in our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8064)|
| 2:14:30| Adding more is not the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| There has to be a way to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8073)|
| 2:14:36| We as a community will be happy to work with whoever to find a solution to these problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| but it's not going to start here with adding another development, another almost 100 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8081)|
| 2:14:48| The MPC continues to approve developments that are directly located in and around dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8088)|

| 2:14:54| The MPC, I don't know if y'all know this or not, approves 90 to 95 percent of rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8094)|
| 2:15:02| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8102)|
| 2:15:04| And guess where the majority of that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| Carnes, Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8107)|
| 2:15:11| Speaking of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8111)|
| 2:15:12| I am going to, yeah, I'm going to ask that you sort of consolidate into a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8112)|
| 2:15:16| Okay, because I do want to give the opposition time to discuss this and our commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8116)|
| 2:15:20| ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| Okay, one final thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| I will leave you with this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8123)|
| 2:15:27| Does the fear of a lawsuit with repercussions to the county outweigh the continued detriment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8127)|
| 2:15:39| and is placed before the safety of the people in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8139)|
| 2:15:48| That's the question that I want you all to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8153)|
| 2:15:53| We may have additional questions, so I would ask that you don't go too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8153)|
| 2:15:58| Mr. Mullins, I have a couple questions to kind of lead us off that might start the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8158)|
| 2:16:07| I'm sorry, your name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8167)|
| 2:16:08| Your last name again, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8168)|
| 2:16:10| Ma'am, your last name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| McBee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8173)|
| 2:16:13| Okay, I thought it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8173)|
| 2:16:14| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| Ms. McBee said that you had filed, and it said in your email that you filed a concept plan with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8175)|
| 2:16:25| commission, or planning, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8187)|
| 2:16:28| Which one of these was it, or was it any of these three that have been provided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| I haven't seen the ones that were provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8192)|
| 2:16:34| The one that I attached to my email is the concept plan that was filed with the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8194)|
| 2:16:38| commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8198)|
| 2:16:39| Is that, is the one that you filed, does that include,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8199)|
| 2:16:43| sorry, I'm going to pull it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8203)|
| 2:16:47| So that includes, that does not include any access into Northampton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| The issue with the, there was a conversation at the meeting about dedicating or deeding over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8213)|
| 2:16:59| a sliver of property to basically cut off that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8219)|
| 2:17:03| Of course, it would, it has to be more than five acres, otherwise it's a new subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8223)|
| 2:17:07| and so we talked about that, and the better way to do that is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| create a lot and make that the common area, and make that a park, and then give access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8231)|
| 2:17:17| to the benefit of Northampton Commons and this proposed subdivision, which is what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8237)|
| 2:17:21| did in this concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8241)|
| 2:17:22| So the plan concept only accesses Emory Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| Okay, next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| In your email, you say that TDOT has, you have TDOT access to Emory Road now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8247)|
| 2:17:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| And that is, is that how, I mean, that is confirmed with TDOT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8259)|
| 2:17:44| My client has told me they've talked to them, and since they have the 2.1 acres dedicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8264)|
| 2:17:50| that they will be able to access West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| Now, exactly where that is, we have it located on a concept plan where we think it is with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8273)|
| 2:17:57| the site distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| There will have to be additional traffic studies to confirm exactly where that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8279)|
| 2:18:03| what improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8283)|
| 2:18:03| We expect there's going to have to be substantial improvement to the frontage of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8283)|
| 2:18:08| to be allowed to access that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8288)|
| 2:18:09| So those details have not been worked out yet, but we have received permission from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8289)|
| 2:18:16| TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8296)|
| 2:18:17| We will be able to access it depending on what improvements will need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8297)|
| 2:18:21| And Mr. Snowden, in the conversation, it was said that Knox County would require that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8301)|
| 2:18:28| the plan be connected to Northampton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8311)|
| 2:18:32| Or could they, as was stated, could they turn that into a common space like a playground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8312)|
| 2:18:40| Could you repeat the question one more time, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| It was stated that Knox County would require this subdivision to connect into Northampton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8323)|
| 2:18:49| on Patriot's Way at that stubbed off road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8331)|
| 2:18:52| Or would the applicant, as he said, be able to turn that into a common space with a playground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| No, we wouldn't necessarily require that connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8337)|
| 2:19:00| They could turn that into a common area, which I think is what their concept plan currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8340)|
| 2:19:05| shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| Are there other questions of the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8347)|
| 2:19:13| Is there anything else you want to add to the response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8353)|
| 2:19:17| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| I mean, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| The last time we were here, Ms. McBee is here for every rezoning application that is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8361)|
| 2:19:25| the Karnes area, and I understand that and respect her concerns for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8365)|
| 2:19:29| The specific neighbors that were from Northampton that were here the last time are not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8369)|
| 2:19:33| so I know we have reached out to them, and we're doing our best to make them happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8373)|
| 2:19:38| Commissioner Skidmaker, questions, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8381)|
| 2:19:42| Mr. Snowden, you have a lot of contact with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| If they were anticipating a curb cut for a new subdivision, they would have a record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8386)|
| 2:19:53| of that, and they would be able to provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8393)|
| 2:19:57| Have you heard any discussions at all with TDOT regarding a curb cut to West Emory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8397)|
| 2:20:03| I have, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8403)|
| 2:20:04| I actually spoke with Andy Padgett today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| He's the Region 1 traffic engineer, because I assumed this conversation would come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8407)|
| 2:20:12| and he did indicate to me that, much like what Mr. Mullins is saying, that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| tentatively allowed access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| However, that access will need to be confirmed with a traffic study as well as some potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8419)|
| 2:20:25| improvements to Emory Road as part of the development, but the state has tentatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8425)|
| 2:20:29| allowed that access, and that's from the state or the regional traffic engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8429)|
| 2:20:35| Okay, and for some of our colleagues who are new, if you'll go to the file and look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8435)|
| 2:20:41| the map on page 5, it's a black and white map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8441)|
| 2:20:46| It'll show you what the opposition was talking about where there's a connection to Patriot's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8446)|
| 2:20:54| Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8454)|
| 2:20:54| In other words, all of the traffic from the 100 homes previously, if they don't get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8454)|
| 2:21:02| TDOT curb cut, would be going into Patriot's Way and then down, what is that, North Hampton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8462)|
| 2:21:09| Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| So you can see all of that traffic would potentially have to go into that smaller subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8471)|
| 2:21:17| there if they don't get the curb cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8477)|
| 2:21:20| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8483)|
| 2:21:23| Mr. Mullins, I guess one of the sticking points is this Patriot's Way, are you going to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8483)|
| 2:21:32| in the deed that there's no entrance there, that this will be common area, even if I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8492)|
| 2:21:39| want to approve this, it doesn't matter if it's two, three, or four, I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8499)|
| 2:21:45| approve this and TDOT comes back and says, no, you can't have it, so you've got a concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8505)|
| 2:21:51| plan that you want to come through Patriot's Way again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| What is Rocky Smith going to do, is he going to say Emory Road or nothing at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8514)|
| 2:22:02| Rocky Smith has told the neighbors it would be Emory Road or nothing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8522)|
| 2:22:05| It was his idea to deed a part of it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| Now, if you're asking if we're willing to put down a deed restriction, for that, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8528)|
| 2:22:13| I think they would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8533)|
| 2:22:18| They're not here today for me to ask them that specific question, but I know they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8538)|
| 2:22:21| the ones that wanted to deed over and it was through the conversations I had with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8541)|
| 2:22:26| it's better because of the five acre limitation for new subdivisions and being able to not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8546)|
| 2:22:32| take out that much property to do it this way by making that a common area and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8552)|
| 2:22:38| deeding that as something to the benefit of both Northampton Boulevard and so they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8558)|
| 2:22:42| are willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8562)|
| 2:22:43| That was their concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8563)|
| 2:22:44| Now, their concept plan has to be approved and there has to be a traffic study, but we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8564)|
| 2:22:51| willing to do the improvements along the frontage of Emory Road so we can have that access like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8571)|
| 2:22:56| Mr. Snowden recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8576)|
| 2:22:59| Well, I want to be careful to where I want you to be able to develop, but I also want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8579)|
| 2:23:05| to be careful that if TDOT was to come back and say, no, you don't have a site distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8585)|
| 2:23:12| or whatever that, you know, we didn't give you approval to go through Patriot's Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8592)|
| 2:23:17| even though I voted for you the last time and I'll probably vote for you again this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8597)|
| 2:23:21| time too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8601)|
| 2:23:22| You know, it's just considered where your interest is at and where your density at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| So, if we approve this tonight and you verbally state that you're going to be a deed restriction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8606)|
| 2:23:33| if TDOT doesn't give you that right-of-way curb cut there, it's a dead issue anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8613)|
| 2:23:40| And then you go back to your lawsuit that I don't know if it's still going on or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8620)|
| 2:23:44| from the past July or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8626)|
| 2:23:47| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8627)|
| 2:23:48| So, are you willing to basically state that there will be no entrance from Patriot's Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8628)|
| 2:23:54| period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| In order for me to state that affirmatively, I'd like for my client to be able to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| with me and they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8641)|
| 2:24:02| And I would ask, you'd probably ask to come back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8645)|
| 2:24:06| I think if I could just be to be absolutely safe on that, then that's what I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| Because I don't want, I know what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| I know they were talking about deeding this over to the owners adjacent to that stub out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8653)|
| 2:24:18| so they would terminate all access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| I know the concept plan changed that to where that was a playground, but because they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8660)|
| 2:24:24| not here and I don't want to say something that they are going to disagree with later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8664)|
| 2:24:30| and I don't want to ever stand in front of this commission purposefully or inadvertently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8670)|
| 2:24:35| say something that doesn't turn out to be true later because that doesn't do me any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8675)|
| 2:24:39| good for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8679)|
| 2:24:39| I would like to be able to confirm that with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| Well, that's my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| You can do what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| And Jim, what are the odds, now we're talking government, government moves slow, what are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8685)|
| 2:24:52| the odds that they would get a curb cut in your previous experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8692)|
| 2:24:56| When I talked to Andy today, he indicated that they felt like they had enough information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8696)|
| 2:25:02| to agree to allow for an access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8702)|
| 2:25:06| I don't believe a traffic study has been completed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8706)|
| 2:25:09| Ben may be able to speak to that, but obviously the traffic study, the engineer that did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8709)|
| 2:25:15| study would have to certify that sight distance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| But my conversation with Andy today is he felt like there was sufficient frontage to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8718)|
| 2:25:23| get an access point that would meet the standards per the TDAW, the entry requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8723)|
| 2:25:29| Mr. Mullins, I see you're typing his answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| I am trying to text him right now, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| Oh, we'll kind of stall so you get an answer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8735)|
| 2:25:40| Ms. Brooks, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8740)|
| 2:25:41| If, since this is a concept plan, if we were to approve it with those conditions and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8741)|
| 2:25:47| conditions weren't met, could the planning commission or the staff or combination take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| that into consideration and say, when it came to you all, say, these were the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8752)|
| 2:25:57| that were agreed upon upon the confirmation of this vote, and if those aren't met, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8757)|
| 2:26:02| you sort of kick it all back and say, sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| Is that something you all can consider in the next phase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| Because once it goes out of here, it doesn't come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8766)|
| 2:26:10| Yes, I mean, depending on what they are, yes, within our purview, it's directly related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8770)|
| 2:26:15| to the site plan, then yes, we can take those into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| Mr. Sanders, could a vote be taken with consideration of access to Emory Road and not connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8778)|
| 2:26:28| to Northampton as in a condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8788)|
| 2:26:32| You have zoned property conditionally in the past, and specifically with respect to entrances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8792)|
| 2:26:38| and what roads are used for access to a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8798)|
| 2:26:42| That is not the preferred way of moving forward with the zoning, because it does take a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| bit of flexibility away from the Planning Commission and site-specific conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8807)|
| 2:26:57| But I don't have a legal objection to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8817)|
| 2:27:01| I want to give Mr. Mullins plenty of time to get with his client if he can reach his client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8821)|
| 2:27:09| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8829)|
| 2:27:14| Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8834)|
| 2:27:15| The property that fronts on Emory Road is currently zoned commercial, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8835)|
| 2:27:21| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8841)|
| 2:27:22| Okay, so a curb cut for that, I'm assuming before we allow a piece of property to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8842)|
| 2:27:28| zoned commercial, we are able to confirm that a curb cut will be allowed for a commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8848)|
| 2:27:33| business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8853)|
| 2:27:37| Correct, and if it, I think those, there may be two lots of record up in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8857)|
| 2:27:42| Three, the state cannot restrict access to a lot of record, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8862)|
| 2:27:49| So there could possibly be, if developed commercially, three curb cuts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8869)|
| 2:27:54| That is correct, the state could work with them about consolidating that, but if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8874)|
| 2:27:58| were different owners, it's my understanding the state cannot restrict access to a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8878)|
| 2:28:03| of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| And if you had three businesses on Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8884)|
| 2:28:07| there's a good possibility they could generate as much traffic as a subdivision of 75 houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8887)|
| 2:28:13| throughout a day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| That's correct, yeah, usually a house generates 10 trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8895)|
| 2:28:19| If you've got a commercial business, it could generate two to three times that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8899)|
| 2:28:24| Okay, so in all probability, TDOT will allow a curb cut there for residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8904)|
| 2:28:33| as opposed to three separate businesses with possibly three curb cuts, unless they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8913)|
| 2:28:40| to combine all those to one entrance and exit, kind of a service road, parking lot kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8920)|
| 2:28:46| concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| So, in your experience, would TDOT look at this pretty much as a trade-off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8928)|
| 2:28:55| In granting the curb cut for the subdivision as opposed to the commercial businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8935)|
| 2:29:01| I certainly wouldn't want to speak for TDOT, but I could see that rationale being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8941)|
| 2:29:07| by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8947)|
| 2:29:09| I think that, based on the line of sight there, I think they do have quite a bit of frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8949)|
| 2:29:18| I think it's a good possibility that they could get the 400 feet minimum of the sight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8958)|
| 2:29:22| distance, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| Yeah, I was looking at the sight distance, and on the concept of where they have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8963)|
| 2:29:27| road coming in, it looks like that is probably a 75-foot lot to the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8967)|
| 2:29:33| Do you know the answer to that question, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8973)|
| 2:29:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| I would be looking at the same site plan that you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8979)|
| 2:29:42| I do think we do have the sight distance to where Blacks Ferry Road is, from where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8982)|
| 2:29:49| have proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8989)|
| 2:29:50| Do you have the measurements of those lots that are to the east of the proposed road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8990)|
| 2:29:56| It looks like there's one, two, three, four, but I'm not sure that that's what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=8996)|
| 2:30:00| talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9000)|
| 2:30:01| Do you have the measurements of those lots that are to the east of the proposed road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9001)|
| 2:30:06| It looks like there's one, two, three, four in this development, and then another undeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9006)|
| 2:30:14| parcel that it looks like sight distance would be halfway to the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9014)|
| 2:30:21| I would agree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| I'm just looking at the scale myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| Okay, and I wanted to ask about the stubbed road, because I'm getting a little confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9026)|
| 2:30:31| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| If you put lots there, wouldn't that end access to that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9033)|
| 2:30:40| It would, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9040)|
| 2:30:44| What we did, though, instead of it being a lot that was not developed that could potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9044)|
| 2:30:49| there could be a revised site plan, revised concept plan, what they were willing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9049)|
| 2:30:53| and I guess I'm coming back to Mr. Daly's, they were willing to actually make that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9053)|
| 2:30:59| playground, a common area for the benefit of both Northampton and this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9059)|
| 2:31:04| So, in order to do that, to make that bonding, they would have to be restricted to be a permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9064)|
| 2:31:09| playground common area for both the benefit of Northampton Commons and this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9069)|
| 2:31:15| So, I don't have a text message yet, but I am willing to say that they will be willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9080)|
| 2:31:24| Mr. Smith, do you have anything additional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| Yes, I'm through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9088)|
| 2:31:30| Ms. McBee, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9090)|
| 2:31:34| Oh, I'm sorry, Ms. Hill, did you have questions of the applicant first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| I have several statements to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| I just wanted to be sure everybody else was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9101)|
| 2:31:44| Commissioner Jay, Robert's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9104)|
| 2:31:47| Yeah, I didn't see his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9107)|
| 2:31:48| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9108)|
| 2:31:49| It wasn't working for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9109)|
| 2:31:50| I'm a little bit new, so a little rusty on this since I've been in front of planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9110)|
| 2:31:56| commissions and stuff like that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9116)|
| 2:31:58| There's already a house on the property, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9118)|
| 2:32:02| Or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9122)|
| 2:32:03| Am I looking at this right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9123)|
| 2:32:04| I think there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9124)|
| 2:32:05| And that house already has access to that road already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9125)|
| 2:32:10| I don't think the access is on East Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9130)|
| 2:32:13| I have to go back and look at the other map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9133)|
| 2:32:17| They probably were accessing off Black's Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| If I were going to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9140)|
| 2:32:22| I haven't studied that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9142)|
| 2:32:24| But while we were having that conversation, I did get confirmation from my client about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9144)|
| 2:32:28| the deed restriction or the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| If you want to impose a condition, we have no objection to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9150)|
| 2:32:33| If you want us to state and condition it upon a deed restriction, we'll do whatever is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9153)|
| 2:32:40| will of this body on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9160)|
| 2:32:44| The satellite view I've got here has it that the access already is to West Emory, to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9164)|
| 2:32:49| house that's on the property existing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9169)|
| 2:32:52| Is that not all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9172)|
| 2:32:53| Is that the house that's not part of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| There is a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| I believe that's the commercial part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| Yeah, that's like a home business or like a house that was turned into a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| So there's already access for this whole entire property if you are merging these two together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9184)|
| 2:33:11| from that home business that already exists onto that road, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9191)|
| 2:33:16| It would appear so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9196)|
| 2:33:17| And it's already a commercial business operating there currently or was at one point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9197)|
| 2:33:21| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9201)|
| 2:33:22| At one point, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9202)|
| 2:33:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9203)|
| 2:33:23| Just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9203)|
| 2:33:26| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9208)|
| 2:33:31| Kyle, there's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9211)|
| 2:33:33| Maybe it was there, but it's not now, just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201116?start=9213)|
