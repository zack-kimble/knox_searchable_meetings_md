| 0:00:00| I call to order this meeting of the Board of Knox County Commissioners for the purpose of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=0)|
| 0:00:12| giving a workshop for Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=12)|
| 0:00:17| which will consist of an overview of the relationship of the various types of long-range plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=17)|
| 0:00:23| to the general plan, the growth plan, and sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=23)|
| 0:00:31| If there be no discussion of commissioners, we will go directly into the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=31)|
| 0:00:41| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=41)|
| 0:00:43| Thank you, Chairman Wright and members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=43)|
| 0:00:46| First, I'm going to hand out some information for you just to provide you with some reading material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=46)|
| 0:00:55| The first thing is a pamphlet just giving you an overview of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=55)|
| 0:01:00| and then the others are a map of the growth policy plan, the urban growth boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=60)|
| 0:01:07| the planned growth boundaries in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=67)|
| 0:01:11| some of our synopsis of the zoning districts that work with the Knox County Zoning Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| and our land-use classifications and description of those and zones which are appropriate for those land-use classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=76)|
| 0:01:24| As I go through those, I'll explain the importance of each of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=84)|
| 0:01:34| One of the key bits of information of what I've handed you is the MPC website, which is knoxnpc.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=94)|
| 0:01:44| There's a great deal of information there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| I'm going to give you a good bit of information, but anytime you have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| there are two sources of answers to most of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| One is the MPC website. The other is the MPC phone number, which is 215-2500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| I know some of you know that very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| The third one, which is not quite as good a source of information, is my e-mail address, which is gerald.green at mpc.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=125)|
| 0:02:14| The reason that that's not as good is because I don't know as much as those who work with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| One of those people I don't know as much as is Dan Kelly, who is sitting back here and is our deputy director of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=139)|
| 0:02:28| As Chairman Wright said, what I want to do is just give you an overview of MPC, all the plans that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=148)|
| 0:02:36| the interconnections among the growth policy plan, the general plan, and the sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=156)|
| 0:02:42| and why they bind us to certain recommendations and the requirements for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| I'll just start now with somewhat of an overview using the slideshow here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=168)|
| 0:02:56| What I'd like you to do is just, if you could, save your questions until the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| If there's a very pertinent question, go ahead and answer it, but I may answer some of your questions as we go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=181)|
| 0:03:08| The MPC was established in 1956 by a joint resolution of the Knox County Board of Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| and the Knoxville City Council as a comprehensive countywide planning and agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=195)|
| 0:03:23| to administer the zoning and subdivision ordinances, but also to develop long-range plans for the county and cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=203)|
| 0:03:31| We adopt a general plan, review subdivision plans and site plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| We review and make recommendations on zoning ordinances and maps and changes to those ordinances and maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=217)|
| 0:03:44| We work with developers and the community as a whole on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=224)|
| 0:03:52| The MPC, and it's often where the staff is called the MPC, the commission is also called the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=232)|
| 0:04:01| but they're two distinct bodies that sometimes the names are used interchangeably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| and our duties are often used interchangeably also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| The commission is composed of 15 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| Eight of those members are appointed by the county mayor, seven of them by the city mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| They serve four-year terms, no compensation, and the commission gets emails on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| from citizens who tell them that if they don't do as the citizens request, that the citizens won't vote for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=267)|
| 0:04:36| That doesn't do much to sway the commissioners because they know they're not elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=276)|
| 0:04:44| City appointees are limited to two consecutive terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| That's a policy that was just recently instituted by Mayor Ruggiero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| There is no limit on the terms of county appointees at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| The MPC staff is a staff currently 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| At one time I believe there was a high of 55 employees at MPC and we're trying to do more with less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| and each day I'm requesting the staff to do more and we're trying to fill all those voids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| and undertake a process to unleash the dam of the backlog of some things that have been on our plates for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=316)|
| 0:05:27| Those are subdivision ordinance updates and revisions to our parking ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| and other ordinances and amendments to our ordinances which have been on our plates for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| The staff is divided into four divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| The comprehensive planning division that works with the general plan and the sector plans and special reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=343)|
| 0:05:51| Development services, the division that has the most interaction with the public and with the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| They review development plans, rezoning requests, subdivision plans, do addressing, the one year plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=358)|
| 0:06:07| work with the city on its capital improvement plan, a number of interactions with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| Information services is our library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| We have an extensive library in both hard copies of reports and also digital copies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| and if you look on our website you'll find access to a number of different reports from development reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| for each of the year providing a synopsis of development activity to commercial reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| dealing with the vacancy rates and number of apartments, offices, and general commercial sites and industrial surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=395)|
| 0:06:44| We also provide demographic and economic data working with the Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| We do mapping for the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| We have a relationship with Legacy Parks to assist them with mapping, do a website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| and all our mapping that you see on the website is through our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| The transportation planning section deals with the long-range transportation plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| not only for Knoxville and Knox County but for five surrounding counties and the municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| within those working closely with the state DOT and the Federal Highway Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| and they work not only with vehicular transportation but also with bicycle plans and greenway plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=440)|
| 0:07:28| Our resources, again, keep the website at your fingertips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| Bookmark that. That's a great resource for any information with regard to the plans and activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| that MPC is undertaking, the agendas for the MPC meetings, the applications for those agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=460)|
| 0:07:48| and other bits of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| In addition to the Metropolitan Planning Commission, the commission itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| and the matters that come before that body, the MPC staff also staffs the Historic Zoning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| which is both county and city historic resources, the Downtown Design Review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| dealing with the design of structures proposed for the downtown and renovation of those structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| the Infill Housing Design Review Board, which is a city board dealing with new construction in older neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| the Tennessee Technology Corridor Development Agency, which is basically the corridor going into Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| and both design standards and the development standards for those developments within that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=507)|
| 0:08:35| and the Board of Zoning Appeals, working with the legal staff and the codes administration and enforcement staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=515)|
| 0:08:42| in staffing the Board of Zoning Appeals for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| With regard to comprehensive planning, we think of that as a 5- to 15-year perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| with large areas and less specific policies for those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| The guiding light, if we want to call it that, for our long-range planning, comprehensive planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| is the growth policy plan, which is mandated by the state legislature and state statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| The development services staff has more of a short-term or 1- to 5-year perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| looking at development plans for new development activity within the city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| and they deal with more specific standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| The number of units permitted per acre within planned districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| the size of signs that are permitted within certain zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=568)|
| 0:09:36| Again, the growth policy plan and the general plan are both mandated by state statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| The state statutes require that growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| They also require a general plan to be adopted and that rezonings be in compliance with the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| The general plan is based upon the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| which serves as the foundation for all the comprehensive planning that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| Within the general plan, we've gone from annual updates of the general plan, the entire general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=600)|
| 0:10:08| to a sector plan approach where we work with the 12 sectors in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| to update those on a regular basis, and they serve as our amendments or updates to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| Therefore, the rezonings have to be in compliance with the sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| and that's why you often get a rezoning request that's preceded by required change in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=624)|
| 0:10:32| Those rezonings, again, have to be in compliance with the general plan or sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| and that's a state requirement, state statute requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| The tools for implementation of our plans are the zoning ordinance, the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| and the historic preservation ordinance, and the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| For example, the Tennessee Technology Corridor has its design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| that are used to implement the policies and the recommendations of our general plan and sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=655)|
| 0:11:02| And this, I think you recognize, and I gave you a hard copy so it's easier to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=662)|
| 0:11:09| It's the growth policy plan, and that provides a framework for our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=669)|
| 0:11:16| Again, there's the urban growth boundaries, the planned growth boundaries, and the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| And within each of those designated areas, there are standards and requirements for the density of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=681)|
| 0:11:29| the type of development that can occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| And I think as you're well aware, we sometimes are hindered by the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| because it was adopted about 15, 16 years ago and has not been updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| and has not kept pace with the infrastructure changes and the changes in the development patterns in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=701)|
| 0:11:49| As I stated earlier, there are 12 sectors in the county that we break down for our planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| and updates to our general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| Six of those sectors are in the county outside the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| and six of the sectors are primarily within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| A bit of a couple of those sectors, city sectors that are actually in the county, also outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| This is a proposed land use within a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=730)|
| 0:12:17| We have a variety of land use categories that we're trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| We, in the past year, have narrowed those down somewhat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| but we still have a number to try to address the different types of growth that the county is experiencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| that the residents and developers propose for the various sectors of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| And within each land use classification, there are zoning categories that correspond to those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| and that's on that list that I gave you, that chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| The land use classifications with proposed land use in our sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| do not dictate the type of development that can occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| The zoning does that, which follows from the land use classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| So it's important for future growth of the county that we identify land use classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=785)|
| 0:13:12| that can accommodate the zoning districts, which would permit the type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| that is considered most compatible with the property being classified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=796)|
| 0:13:28| This gets a bit more detail at the proposed land use classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| and the land use plan showing the various designations from commercial to office to residential to open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| And we also now have done, as we get into more detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| we do the slope analysis and apply that on some of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| Our sector plans also provide for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| in addition to those general land use classifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| they provide examples of development concepts, as you see on the slide here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| from mixed use development to commercial development to residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| and even road cross sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| And these are only policy recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| These plans are not mandatory, only providing those guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| and those recommendations for amendments and changes in our policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| and standards that would implement the recommendations of the sector plans and the general plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| We do work closely with the County Parks and Recreation Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| in trying to refine and better define the recreation plans for the various communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| as part of the sector plan update, working with the greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| and other recreation facilities within a sector to, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| better define the needs of that community for recreation and outdoor activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=887)|
| 0:14:55| We also work with green infrastructure, which is primarily our agricultural areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| and trying to work with those who wish to continue agricultural land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| to identify ways to preserve those land uses and make policies which would enhance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=905)|
| 0:15:14| and possibly preserve the use of those agricultural lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| And those include, you know, looking at our existing parks, even our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| We consider the land around schools as part of our green infrastructure, lakes and creeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| and, again, the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| We also look at historic resources in each of the sector plans, looking at those historic structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| And as I stated earlier, one of the boards that our staff assist is the Historic Zoning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| and that commission does serve both the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| Currently, there's a study underway to update the survey of historic structures in the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=948)|
| 0:15:57| We also look in the sector plan at the transportation plan, looking at proposed road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| getting input on what road improvements are needed to accommodate the development in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| and what those road improvements should look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| dealing with our vehicular transportation system, sidewalk improvements, bicycle facilities and transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=971)|
| 0:16:19| realizing that transit is limited in the parts of the county outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| One of our most consistent comments in our sector plans in the past year or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| has been the identification of needs for enhanced and more sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=989)|
| 0:16:37| We also do design guideline administration both through the Historic Zoning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| the Downtown Design Review, the Enfield Housing Committee, Tennessee Technology Corridor Development Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| And two of these are within the county, the Historic Zoning Commission and the Tennessee Technology Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| The others are primarily within the Downtown Design Review and the Enfield Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| Those properties and projects are within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| Again, looking at our zoning map, we get more detail with the zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| and the zoning does dictate the use of the property and set standards for the development of those uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| from setbacks to heights to parking requirements, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| And again, the zoning has to be in compliance with those general land use classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| set forth in the sector plan and the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| We can look at areas, and we often get rezoning requests for areas that include more than one property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| and we look at those and their compatibility with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| to assure that the zoning can occur without a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| This is showing the hillside and the floodway within the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| We try to look at the various characteristics of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| which would impact development of the property as we assess the rezoning requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| or even applying the initial zoning for properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| With our site plan review and development plan review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| we do a detailed review of our staff and development services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| It starts with the overall site plan for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| and then proceeds from that to subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1099)|
| 0:18:28| I think it jumped over a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| Development plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| It went from slide 21 to 27, so some of my details on the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| With site plan review, we also look at landscape plan, often the building design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| especially in planned commercial districts and within the Tennessee Technology Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| We look at landscaping requirements, parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| so the development plan, as shown here, seems one-dimensional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| but we get into all the dimensions of that development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| Then we also do subdivision review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| and this occurs primarily at staff level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| The subdivisions are reviewed by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| The review of subdivisions is often on the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| because it's largely a technical process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| If the subdivisions comply with the technical requirements of the subdivision ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| and with the county engineering standards, there's no issue with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| We review final plans, and the Planning Commission accepts those final plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| and they're recorded prior to development of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| Some of the things we're working on now are the East County Community Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| We're well into it, and there will be a public meeting on July 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| That's a Sunday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| It's an ice cream social that we'll have at the Carter Senior Center to get the input of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1197)|
| 0:20:04| We felt that maybe Sunday afternoon and getting them there for ice cream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| we'd have a better turnout than on a Tuesday evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| when they have to get kids to a softball game or have other commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| We have started the process of updating the City of Knoxville Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| and we'll be full bore into that within the next couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| We're looking at the mixed-use zoning district for Bearden and other areas within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| These with question marks behind them are things that we've heard about but have not started yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| The Growth Policy Plan, again, that plan has not been updated in the 15 or 16 years since its adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| Standards for scenic corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| We heard from two different community groups in the county about the need for standards for their corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1245)|
| 0:20:54| One was the John Sevier Scenic Highway, better standards for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| Another one was in West Knox County along Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| of design standards for development along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| The Carnes Community Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| The residents of Carnes have asked that a community plan be prepared for their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| Powell Community Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| The Enhanced Powell Group has asked how they could get a community plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| to better envision what they want for the future of their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| So those are issues that are out there, and we have not been directed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| I do, but they're on the side of the stove waiting to be put on the burner now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1290)|
| 0:21:39| At this point, just questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Any questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| How can we as the staff better serve you, provide you with the information you need to make your decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1303)|
| 0:21:54| Yes, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| You said that the city recently had adopted the rule of two terms, and they're limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1315)|
| 0:22:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| And the county has no limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| I guess the next question will be for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| How do we change that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Because I think it needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| I'd have to look and see what the actual statute says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| I say the city can do it, you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| I thought at one time you all had passed an ordinance whereby all your committees were term limited as the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1340)|
| 0:22:32| but I'll have to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| I'll be glad to look at it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Commissioner Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Since there's no more forest annexation now, is there any need to still have the urban growth plan and the sector plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1365)|
| 0:22:56| It's almost like they're extra work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| The state statutes require them, so that's where the need comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| I guess my first planning was what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| I guess the reason I ask is other counties have already started eliminating their sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| Well, they're in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Well, there needs to be a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| The zoning has to be in compliance with the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| And again, our sector plans are instead of updating the entire county's general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| we broke the county down into sectors to make it more manageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| And we at staff are looking at is that the best way to do it, or do we need to do community plans and corridor plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| or is there some balance between sector plans and community plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| Because looking at our, for example, our northwest sector plan, a huge area, a lot of population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| and there's a difference between the Carnes community and the east end of Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1428)|
| 0:23:58| Do we need to lump those all together, or do we need to separate them out and break them out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| And that's an issue we're debating internally, and any comments or direction from the commission would be welcome on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1442)|
| 0:24:09| But in terms of needing them, we need that general plan and the sector plans because of the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| I mean, if we went to more of a community plan, then the sector plans kind of wouldn't be needed, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| because you're individually each one, Hardin Valley or Carnes or Pines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| And there may be some match there, mix and match of sector plans and community plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| We're still hashing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| By statute, how often does the general plan have to be updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1482)|
| 0:24:50| I'm not aware that it states any date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| I'll turn to Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| There's no date in there, and what we're trying to do is, again, through those sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| is just keep the general plan relevant so that we don't have to come to you with every rezoning request with a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1498)|
| 0:25:12| Don't we admit we change sector plan all the time, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1512)|
| 0:25:19| We each year we take a different sector and update it so we're probably if you went from sector to sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1519)|
| 0:25:32| probably it's about a seven to ten year cycle that we update those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| And we're trying to get into a more regular cycle with that also so it's not taking as long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1539)|
| 0:25:47| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Thank you, Mr. Green, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| So there's 12 sectors, and every year and a half or so we try to get one completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| It takes more than a year to do one, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| Well, we're trying to get it down to a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| We're working on some things, and this gets into maybe mundane details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| but instead of having in each sector plan a section on the growth trends in that sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1568)|
| 0:26:17| what we're trying to do is starting to do is a countywide growth trend analysis report each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| so that we can look at the county as a whole and how different areas are growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| Do that, and we're debating whether to do that on a sector basis or a county commission basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| so you can look at how your district has grown over the past year or so to keep it on a sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| and we're hoping that and some other things we do will speed up the sector planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| And what would be your opinion if the legislature decides to let municipalities option out of doing the growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1603)|
| 0:26:55| I think it may save us a bit of anguish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| I do think we need that general plan and the direction it provides for us to enable us to allocate our resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1618)|
| 0:27:08| to know where we need to build infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| and to give the citizens of the community an idea of how their community is going to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| and I guess some measure of assurance that what their neighboring property will be used for or how it will be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1635)|
| 0:27:25| Thank you for being here today. Thank you for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| When I was on MPC we worked on the growth boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| and one of the things that I asked about when I was on there was we have a MPC, Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1660)|
| 0:27:50| There was a lot of counties that didn't have that growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| and they wanted to have some way of controlling the growth in an orderly manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| and so we passed the, well, we asked for every three years to update this, which hasn't been done, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1677)|
| 0:28:06| But it's not your problem because it should have been done all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| We've got to the point where this growth plan, with it not being updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| seems to me is irrelevant because it hasn't been updated and you have to change it piecemeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| So if we could get the legislature to say we don't need it anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| that would help us make our plans a little bit better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| and still put the emphasis on the counties that do not have an organized planning committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| to take care of their own issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| So the urban growth plan, from what I understand what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| now correct me if I'm wrong, is something we really don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1722)|
| 0:28:50| We didn't need it at the time we put it in there because we had a Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| I think we need a plan to guide us, whether that's a growth policy plan or the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| I think the challenge with the growth policy plan now is that it has not been updated for so many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| So it's limiting us in ways that we don't need to be limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1747)|
| 0:29:14| And if the growth policy plan were not there and we continued to update our general plan and do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| I think that would be adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| But at this point, the major reason we need a growth policy plan is the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| Well, there again, to me it is that we have our growth policy plan here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1767)|
| 0:29:36| Union County and some of these other smaller counties may not have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| but it's hindering us is what I understand you're saying right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| But it's causing other smaller communities to have to really look at the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1785)|
| 0:29:54| I think we could be more flexible in how we deal with development without the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| And having a general plan that sets forth our direction for growth and where growth will occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| and where we need infrastructure upgrades and schools, parks, other facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| So having done this, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| is there some way that we could petition the state government to let us opt out of the growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1816)|
| 0:30:26| I think that this is something you can deal with the Knox County delegation with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| And you probably need to talk to your state representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| Whether you can do something just for Knox County alone is kind of questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| Because we are a charter and it doesn't operate on us like it used to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1842)|
| 0:30:49| But they may be able to do it based upon population across the state or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| I would talk to our state delegation and see what their plans are to do with growth plans anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1854)|
| 0:31:01| since they have eliminated forced annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| It may be a mood issue across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| They may nullify it and the MPC could deal with it in terms of the general overall plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| as how growth would affect our general overall plan without actually having a growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1874)|
| 0:31:23| But those are policy issues at the state level and I think you need to go to Nashville to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| If we go to Nashville and see, will we have to have some sort of directive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| to saying that this is what we want instead of me going and talking to the delegates that represent my area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| Would we have to have this for the whole county though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| And just go to each, pinpoint those representatives and talk to them that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| Or how do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| Well, every year in the fall you have a meeting of the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| our state representatives, our delegation here in Knox County collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| We bring a lot of issues before them at that time as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| You could do a resolution and send a delegation to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| There's many ways you could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| The bottom line is the state will have to see how it fits in their overall policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| These are all state policy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| They were theirs to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| And anything you do is just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| Okay, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| Let me return to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Mr. Green, I understand we have a general plan that's required by the state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| that we choose to break down into sector plans here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| We also have a growth plan that's required by the state that's by state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| that carries more weight, obviously, than our general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| because we can't supersede our densities in those areas that are ruled with our sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1979)|
| 0:33:07| What is it in the language of that statute that gives it power over the growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1987)|
| 0:33:15| I mean the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| And I wish I were more familiar with the statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| but the statute says that all the growth management plan does dictate our growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| those urban growth areas, the planned growth areas, and the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| And that growth policy plan sets densities and types of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| and the general plan must be in compliance with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| The statute states that the general plan and all planning decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| must be in compliance with that growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| A properly executed sector plan, review, planning, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2035)|
| 0:34:02| incorporates what we're talking about, the future use of that particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| or the properties within that particular sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| whether it happens to be urban, planned, rural, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| But you're taking care of that future planning with your sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| We're planning five years ahead with each sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| So, in effect, we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| We're just doing it a different way than what the state said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| We're doing sector plans, which when you boil it right down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| as was mentioned a while ago, and I think maybe Mr. Greene alluded to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| that maybe we need to do some of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| Sectors are so big, we may need to do a community plan as part of the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| because what happens on one side of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| it's not exactly the same thing on the other side of the street all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| But we are doing that urban and planned growth now with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2096)|
| 0:35:09| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| Mr. Greene, do you have any idea of how many times Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| has changed a sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2118)|
| 0:35:26| When I came on commission, I think that first year there was 107 changes to the southwest sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2126)|
| 0:35:38| Zoning changes to meet building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| So my question is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| If you have a plan, what good is a plan if you're going to change it all the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| What's your response to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| I'd say I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| And that, I think, to follow up, that puts a burden on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| And then in the year I've been here, I'm trying to think, on average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| two or three sector plan amendments each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| So at least we're reducing the number of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| I think that puts a burden on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Two burdens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| One is to update the sector plans more regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| I think when they get out of date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| there's more of a need to amend those for a zoning change or other purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| And that's one of the reasons we're trying to reduce the amount of time it takes us to do the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| The other puts a burden upon us to more accurately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| to the extent we can, more accurately anticipate the growth that's going to occur in a sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| And that's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| None of us have crystal balls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| And it's a balance of community interest, developer interest, the overall county's interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| and trying to balance those as we do the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| Do you believe that a property owner has a right to do with their property whatever they like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2219)|
| 0:37:08| That's a tough one, and I'll tell you that I've learned after 30-plus years of working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| and planning public and private sector on this side of the mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| and on the east side of the mountains, but always in the mountains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| that no property owner wants anyone to tell them what to do with their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| but every property owner wants somebody to tell their neighbor what to do with their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| Perfect answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Before recognizing Commissioner Brown, then Commissioner Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| looking at this month's agenda for next week in zoning and sector plan changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2262)|
| 0:37:53| there are nine items, and three of those are sector plan changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2273)|
| 0:38:00| So to say that if we hold a plan and the plan becomes sacred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| and the plan is only revisited or visited and it takes a year to visit the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| and we're only doing it every nine to ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| then there has to be sector plan changes in between sector plan approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2296)|
| 0:38:24| Then Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| When you do a sector plan, that's future planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| and if the community and NPC gets together and decides this property over here in this area needs to be XYZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2312)|
| 0:38:40| they don't come up right now and zone it XYZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| It's not zoned until it goes on the market, it's bought for some particular use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| Then you change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| But it's what was approved in the plan when you made the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| It just wasn't changed then, but now you have to legally change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| Make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| I think that the sector plan is a very broad brush, points you in this direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2348)|
| 0:39:16| idealistic kind of where you think you maybe want to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| and I don't have a problem with all the changes because that's when reality meets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| what we kind of thought we were going to do, or at least give us some direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| If it's the general agreement of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| I'd be glad to talk with the Knox County delegation about how they would go about furthering Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2377)|
| 0:39:49| the opportunity to opt out of the growth plan should they so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2389)|
| 0:39:59| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Mr. Chair, I think that's one of the biggest challenges we face in the next three to five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2401)|
| 0:40:08| is the limitations the growth plan is putting on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| We are already pushing against these areas where our densities are set far lower than the market will bear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2413)|
| 0:40:21| and it is going to hurt our property tax growth and our growth overall if we can't get something done about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2421)|
| 0:40:30| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| The only point I was trying to make is the state mandated that we had to make a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| for urban growth, where it was low-density residential, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| We had to make these sections for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| The problem of it is when it comes to the MPC, then somebody wants to do something in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2447)|
| 0:40:54| then one of the first things is it's not in the growth plan for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| So you're bumping the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| I believe we have the right to decide what we need to do here, and that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| So my suggestion is not having them have to deal with the state-mandated urban growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| or whatever kind of plan the state has us doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| There's nothing in what we're doing right now that mandates that the MPC has to update that every three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2481)|
| 0:41:32| because if it is, it's made this plan we've got right now irrelevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| because we haven't updated it, and that's why so many sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| It could make it a little bit easier for us to get the growth plans that we need in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2507)|
| 0:42:03| Seeing no further discussion from commissioners, Mr. Green, do you have any closing comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2523)|
| 0:42:15| First, to thank you for this opportunity, and again, to look at our website, call that number, email me, come visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2535)|
| 0:42:25| Whenever you have questions, we'll try to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| If we don't have answers immediately, we'll work to find the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| The discussion of growth policy plan, sector plan, general plan, and sector plan can be summarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2553)|
| 0:42:43| But the growth policy plan forms our foundation, and it is required by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2563)|
| 0:42:50| It's something that at one point Knox County, city of Knoxville, town of Farragut agreed on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| and that drives our decision-making at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| Those other plans, the general plan and the sector plan flow from those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| and have to be in compliance with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| Again, it's sometimes challenging, and part of that challenge is because we didn't update it every three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2588)|
| 0:43:17| and we're having challenges as a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| Our infrastructure has grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| Our development patterns have changed over those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| We try to keep abreast of those to the extent we can with our sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| Even that's challenging because with a seven- to ten-year turnaround, we don't have crystal balls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| and that's why we have to revisit those sector plans with amendments during that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| We look forward to working with all of you and your input as we try to address the needs of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2620)|
| 0:43:48| Again, I thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Okay, we wish to thank you for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| I verify with you that it's July 17, Carter Senior Citizen Center and Ice Cream Social at what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2637)|
| 0:44:08| Two o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| That's a Sunday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| It's a Sunday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| And the item for discussion will be the East County Community Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Madam Commission Director of Staff, I would like for the minutes of the meeting to show 11 commissioners in attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2662)|
| 0:44:39| for a presentation by Gerald Green of Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| Presentations were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| Questions were asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| There was no deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| No votes taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| There being nothing more to come before this workshop, we will be meeting for work session at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160620MPC?start=2695)|
