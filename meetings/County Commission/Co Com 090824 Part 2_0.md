| 0:00:00| Just after the reorganization meeting we meet, and I don't think this committee wants to, I appreciate Commissioner Pinkston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:10| asking for the definition of the powers granted to these committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10)|
| 0:00:14| This committee does not want to operate out of those bounds or out of those parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14)|
| 0:00:19| It's, you know, we don't have personal agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=19)|
| 0:00:22| I mean, looking at it politically, there's probably more minefields out there than there is an upside to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=22)|
| 0:00:27| because it's a lot of nuts and bolts stuff we do that makes some people unhappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=27)|
| 0:00:36| But nevertheless, it's a good committee, and I welcome input from everyone on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=36)|
| 0:00:42| so we can get this charter framed, something that we can all live with, or maybe not all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=42)|
| 0:00:48| but at least ten of us can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=48)|
| 0:00:50| I hope it will be unanimous, but at least ten of us can live with just to move this forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=50)|
| 0:00:55| and I think we will have a better government as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=55)|
| 0:01:00| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=60)|
| 0:01:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=63)|
| 0:01:05| I'm the third member of the audit committee that's also a member of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=65)|
| 0:01:12| Something has been said here that I'll get to in just a second, but let me belabor the point for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=72)|
| 0:01:20| The audit committee is not really set up solely as best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| We've set up the audit committee because it's given to us by state law that it's something we should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=86)|
| 0:01:36| So a few months ago, I don't know ever how long it's been since the audit committee has been formed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=96)|
| 0:01:42| that's the reason the audit committee was formed, and its majority is commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=102)|
| 0:01:47| So I want everyone sitting here at the big table to know that we are working several hours a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=107)|
| 0:01:59| on the best interest of what I think to be in the best interest of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| So we're not taking away your power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| In fact, we have an example here today related to this audit of payroll looking for phantom employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=129)|
| 0:02:21| That was a charge given to the audit committee months and months ago, but as government grinds kind of slow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=141)|
| 0:02:29| we are grinding very finely, and we are finally, out of the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| bringing back to full commission the proposition of how the payroll audit should be conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| And I think you all showed that we've done a good job because you voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| I think that's the way the audit committee should work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| It's a subcommittee of full commission, and it has at its disposal the expertise of a couple of outside citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=171)|
| 0:03:01| and then the ability to work with the internal auditor of Knox County to get these tasks performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=181)|
| 0:03:14| The thing that I really start out saying now is the fact that I don't see in this resolution that's before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=194)|
| 0:03:21| anything affecting what I've just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| All we're doing is talking about money and who has the right to take whatever this line item in the budget is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=205)|
| 0:03:32| and go buy pencils and erasers and get checks cut for salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| and handle the money that is used by the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=217)|
| 0:03:45| If I'm wrong in that assumption, please someone raise their hand and correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| Am I correct in assuming that we're talking about money that funds the internal auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| and the internal auditor taking those budgeted funds is going to act in the best interest of the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=237)|
| 0:04:08| and ultimately in the best interest of county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| That's the way I understand it, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Now, at least two of us are on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| Other than that, I believe that where we've been far afield in who's in charge of getting things done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=258)|
| 0:04:28| we're not really discussing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| I mean, we've discussed it at length, but the lines that are established between full commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=270)|
| 0:04:38| the audit committee, and the internal auditor, we've wrestled with that meeting after meeting after meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| and that's something that we have on our September 1st agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| is trying to get our charter in such a position that we can bring it to full commission so that it can be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=291)|
| 0:05:01| because that's the way we in Knox County want to see our auditing function run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| We're not deciding that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| We, the audit committee, have not brought that to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| But this resolution here is to try to deal with who can buy things that makes the internal auditor's office run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=312)|
| 0:05:23| and I believe that's all it involves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| Mr. Hammond, the letter that you just kept that you got from Richard Wallace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=331)|
| 0:05:39| I believe you were one of the citizens at that time that helped draft that from the efficiency panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=339)|
| 0:05:46| You were a citizen at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| They're the ones that came up with we need an internal auditor and set that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| Yes, it was a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| And that was ten citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| And the reason why they did it like that is because they wanted our government to be transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| Now, a citizen should have the right to call for an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| I should have the right to call for an audit, the whole commission, the mayor, everybody should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| But I believe Mr. Wallace will tell you just because I say go audit this guy does not mean that he will go audit him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=369)|
| 0:06:18| You have to show him some evidence and a reason why, some proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| Now, we're going to watch against what ten citizens called the efficiency panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| They checked our government in every way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| And you were a citizen at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| And that's what ten citizens came up with that they thought was fair for our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| They recommended the establishment of the Department of Internal Audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| Now, as far as an audit committee, that was not discussed at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| However, when you look at it and you deal with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| the state is recommending that there be an audit committee to oversee that function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| But we're trying to take away the powers of the people by saying no one else can ask for an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| And that's what the efficiency panel came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| A citizen, a commissioner, a mayor, or the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| That's who they thought when you were on that panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| They should have the authority to call for an audit if you had the evidence to show the auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| And I don't disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| Okay, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| But we're losing that if we turn everything over to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| No, I would disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| But we can debate that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| I would disagree also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| Commissioner Burroughs, are you too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| I think anybody can still call for an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| Anybody who wants to call for an audit can do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| They just go through the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| That doesn't limit anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| But what if the audit committee rules against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| The audit committee is made up of three commissioners and two professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| And if they see evidence that an audit needs to be conducted, then I'm sure that they will call for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| But this also keeps anybody from making any kind of frivolous gotcha kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=481)|
| 0:08:09| by filtering it through the audit committee that helps them weed out people who are trying to use the auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| and not commissioners but people from the public to make a political point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| I think that's a very important protection that Richard deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| I think if anybody comes forward with evidence and presents it to Richard Walsh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| or whoever our internal auditor is at that time, that he should check that evidence out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| If it goes nowhere, then there's no audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| But if it leads into something, he should audit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| Well, establishing this audit committee doesn't preclude anyone from still going through the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| if they want to go that way to get an audit done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| But it takes away the autonomy of the internal auditor by not having the other option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=529)|
| 0:08:56| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| It was an anonymous letter, still anonymous, that started this payroll audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| Some citizen out there sent an anonymous letter to Dr. Corsolo six months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| alleging ghost employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| I mean, it's taken six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| But, I mean, just to show you that it's not, it doesn't have to be a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| That was started by an unknown person, for what it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| We have a motion on the floor to approve the transfer of the budget back to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| With the additional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| With the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| With the additional of $22,000 from change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| Yes, transferring it from the audit committee to the internal audit line item plus the additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| Is everyone clear on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| It's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| We have someone from public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| Mr. Chairman, yes, I think I see Mr. Shaw out there and there may be one or two others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=596)|
| 0:10:03| Mr. Swan, excuse me, Mr. Swan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| Maybe three or four people that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| We're supposed to start zoning right at six, so I think I need to maybe do one and then go to zoning and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| Well, we all have different points to discuss, but, you know, that's up to the commission to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| But I don't have all the information to be able to present to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| But I've come before this commission once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| What's your name and address, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| I'm sorry, Richard Swan, 1829 Scenic Valley Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| I've come before this commission once before with regard to speed humps and the cost of speed humps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| and, you know, why are we spending that cost at this time and with other things going on in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=640)|
| 0:10:47| We also have our subdivision voted in favor of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| But through that voting process, we've found some forged ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| We've found some other irregularities in that voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| Someone else will speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| And then we also have just questions about that whole process and how it's handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| And then the two people that or at least two people that had a forged ballot for their household are actually here tonight to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=666)|
| 0:11:16| But I basically wanted to talk with you about the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| If you look at documents from the county, the county estimates speed hump installation at somewhere between $2,000 to $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=679)|
| 0:11:28| If you look at memos and information that county engineer Bruce Weitrick and others have given to the press, that number is roughly $437 per speed hump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=688)|
| 0:11:39| But then John Sexton, who is part of that department, also comes back and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| That number is only for the material, the actual asphalt and the sign itself and the striping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| It does not uncover the labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| And I would assume he did not go any further, but if it only covers the material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| then I'm assuming it's not covering the capital expense of the equipment itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| And I don't know how we as a county think that we can install a speed hump for $437| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| when private sector funds, which I think they probably run much more efficient than county government does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=729)|
| 0:12:16| and it takes them $2,000 to $3,000 to install a speed hump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| You know, where is that discrepancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| How do we account for that discrepancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| And obviously if we're not accounting for the cost of labor and the cost of managers of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=746)|
| 0:12:34| and the time and everything to spec that and do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| and we're not accounting for the cost of the capital investment in the equipment itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| then how do we know what we're spending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| You know, we have no clue what we're spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| and therefore we have no clue what the impact on the county budget is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| And my understanding, and I've tried to call the finance department today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| and I did receive a return phone call but was not able to get back in touch with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| so I'm trying to nail down a number just for my own edification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| But my understanding is that that department on a yearly basis spends about $400,000 on traffic calming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=785)|
| 0:13:13| speed humps and other devices designed to slow traffic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| That's 10 teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| You know, that's 10 teachers that I know we eliminated at least 10 positions from the Knox County School Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=801)|
| 0:13:28| because county commission did not provide enough funding for them to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| And I just think that in the economic times that we're in right now, how can we say speed humps are a priority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=813)|
| 0:13:41| You know, our neighborhood has had no accidents that involved any type of personal injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| Now, someone in the neighborhood will say that there were two dogs that were run over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| Well, there's a leash law, and if their dog was out of their yard, then, you know, it shouldn't have been out of their yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| That's tragic, but is it worth $400,000 a year to implement speed humps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| and take that money away from our kids when we've got schools that are in this county that are failing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| and are under state control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| You know, I just, you know, I'm sorry I'm passionate about this, but that just infuriates me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=850)|
| 0:14:17| And my example of that is if there's one department that's spending that much money wastefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| then there are bound to be other departments that are spending money as wastefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| and you all are the only people that we can come to and petition and redress to ask, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| why is this money being spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| You know, my opinion, the county is hemorrhaging funds that are a waste of our expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| and are a waste of our resources when I would have to guess that county revenues are down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| property values are down, and yet the assessor is raising property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| and I think that's probably going to come to a head eventually with homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| But, you know, that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| You know, as county commission, I would like to see you all take an active interest in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| and say, you know, why is this even a line item at this point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| when we have enforcement avenues available to us if speed is that big of a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| Other people are going to speak to the process and speak to the issue of forged ballots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| that occurred in our neighborhood and how the process was really not done that well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| But, you know, my issue and the issue that I've had all along is the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| and why are we as citizens paying that much money for speed humps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| that really have limited or no value that you can attach to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| I appreciate you all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| I especially would like to thank Finbar Sanders and Ed Schaus for their continuing to take my phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| and speak to me and the timeliness with which they have returned those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| I think you have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| No, I didn't have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| I did want to thank you for coming and letting your views be known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| Mr. Chairman, I would ask the commission consider letting the others talk now before the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=964)|
| 0:16:15| I think I need to go after zoning because by law we're supposed to start zoning right at six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=975)|
| 0:16:22| That probably goes in conflict with our just passed rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| Well, I wanted to start at 530, but you all got to talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| That's part of my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| We kind of talked ourselves into this corner and I hate to ask the citizens to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| Well, we have people in zoning citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| I know, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| I meant it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| But when they came here today, they expected to wait until the very end of the meeting to be able to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| No, actually they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| I called them earlier and said 530 to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| Can we suspend the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| Well, I can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| We can always vote to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| See, we're wasting all this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| We've got questions for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| Will you finish, Commissioner Luthor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| I never had it got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| I just want to ask Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| We took a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| How much are we spending annually on speed humps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| The speed hump program that Knox County has is not a line item in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| We absorb this through our regular operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| We did not hire any additional employees, didn't buy any additional equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| The only thing that we do is, and I'll tell you how we calculate it, and you can calculate it various ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| We calculate it based on the tonnage of asphalt, the striping, and the signs that we use to install a speed hump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:54| So a speed hump will cost you anywhere from $285 to $435 apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| And the difference is, a $435 speed hump, we install two signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| But we did not come and have any additional money appropriated for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| Now, I don't know the exact number of speed humps that we've installed, but I can assure you it's not $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| We would have had to have installed a thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| That raised my eyebrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| There's absolutely no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| We would have had to install almost a thousand speed humps to come up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| Your best guess, how many speed humps do you think you put in the last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| I have that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| That's what I want to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| I do know what that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Is it in the tens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Is it in the hundreds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| I'm sure it's less than 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| But here again, this is a program that we're acting in response to homeowners coming to us saying they want this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1122)|
| 0:18:51| And that was getting lead into my second point I was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| Thank you, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| I've been involved in homeowners association for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1136)|
| 0:19:03| And one of the chief complaints or concerns that homeowners associations have is speeding within the subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:14| And the sheriff's department, and I'm sure the police department has the same problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| they can come out and they can shoot radar and they can get a few people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| and more than likely it's going to be the people that actually live in that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| After they go away, maybe a few days, people slow down and then they speed right again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:39| It's a creature of habit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| It's the way they drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| And, Bruce, it seems like this has been maybe the best alternative or way that you've been able to come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:53| to actually slow down people driving through these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| We know of no other alternative, and I'm not advocating speed humps or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| I'm just saying that if someone comes to us and we want traffic slowed down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| or we want the volume of cut-through traffic decreased, we will tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| This is the only thing that we've seen that is effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| And then we require a 70% approval rating on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Seventy percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| That's what we've referred to as a super majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| Now, I do have concerns if there have been some forged ballots, and if that is true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| then we need to come up with a process to try to eliminate that as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:39| We did identify at least two forged ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| I don't know if there's more out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| If there are, they need to bring them to our attention, and we have come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| There's no way to completely eliminate it because if you don't send a ballot in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| then someone can send one in your steed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| Plus, because this is all, everything that we do is a public record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| so if someone wants to know, wants to see the ballots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| they can determine who didn't send one in and who did send one in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| But here again, what we're looking at is we require a substantial margin for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| So if you're going to have forged ballots, you're going to have to have an awful lot of them to shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| I think in this subdivision, and I may be a little bit wrong on these numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| I think we had 200 people vote in favor of this and 80 vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| That was the margin of approval in this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Commissioner Saunders, we've got five lights on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| I just want to say thank you for coming down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| but I do want to clarify one thing that you did say about the Knox County school system losing 10 school teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1300)|
| 0:21:48| because Knox County didn't fund the school board's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| We funded the whole amount that Knox County requested the county commissioner to fund this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1315)|
| 0:22:03| So I just wanted to clarify that, that we did fund every amount of dollars that Knox County schools asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| and also remind people that Knox County commission does not control how Knox County schools spend their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:18| That's totally left up to the school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| We only fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| We don't tell them how to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| But we did fund the whole amount that they requested this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| Excuse me for interrupting, but it should be noted that the budget prepared by the schools did cut 35 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| You know, and I know Bruce deals with this on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| I mean, there's always that balance between schools, you know, jails, health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:57| I'm an advocate of slower speeds, whether we have, you know, accidents involving humans or no accidents at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1377)|
| 0:23:07| But in terms of driving slow in residential neighborhoods, I'm for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| If it adds a minute onto your day, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| And I'm sure it doesn't add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| So I'm an advocate of traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| I think the slower we drive in residential areas, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| But there is a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| You know, we don't want to install 1,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| So I just wanted to publicly say that, you know, and I'm not going to speak to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| But it sounds like 200 to 80, even if you had 25 folks in here saying that they had forced ballots, that's still not going to really sway it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:49| So, you know, then we get into, well, how do we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| Do we have Greg McKay come and have an official election and that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| So I don't want to spend too much money on staffing the voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| So, you know, and I'm sure that what drove them to this super majority, just in case we have some improprieties out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:10| the onesies and twosies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| If you don't mind, Commissioner, let me just tell you how we do the voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| And no system is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| I'm not saying we wouldn't have made a mistake or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| But what we do is we get the property owner's name from the Registered Deeds Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| And we only deal with property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| So if you are a renter, we do not count you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| We will not count a renter's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| We match that up with the Registered Deeds Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| It's a rather tedious and time-consuming process that we go through to validate these ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| Because it becomes a heated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Because you can see there's people down here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| So that's how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| And we do not allow renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Now, we've had situations where we've had conflicting ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| Husband votes this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Wife votes that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| I can't tell you exactly how we set it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| We just send it back and we let them slug that out at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| But that's essentially how we go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| And the other thing is we only do count the return ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| Bruce, the procedure you outlined sounds very similar to what was recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1506)|
| 0:25:13| When you finish, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| You were next anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Bruce, the procedure sounds very similar to what we went through in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| But because we're in the city limits, we used the Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| Is there a possibility of using a third party like the Community Design Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| so these kinds of things don't get in the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| Well, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| I do know the City's Traffic Calming Program, and I may have this number wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| I do know the first year they budgeted, they did budget about $235,000 for that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| We've absorbed this whole process with staff on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| For instance, I already have the paving equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| I didn't have to go out and hire anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| It still does require quite a bit of staff time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| But I didn't create a new position just to do a traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| I've got several traffic engineers that work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| So, yes, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| But if we're going down that route, then, yes, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| I'd like to see a line item appropriation in my budget for traffic calming in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| Governor Harman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Bruce, the percentage of voters, let's say you send out 300 residential letters to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| and only 100 of them, 150 sent their response back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| So you take 70% of the 150 people to send it in, or do you take the 300?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| No, sir, we have changed our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| We only count return ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| However, during that process, we post signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| People know something's going on in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| They may say that, well, gosh, I didn't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| If they've been out of the country for a month or 45 days, maybe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| But most everybody knows that traffic calming and balloting is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| We have a public meeting at their convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| They pick the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| We have a public meeting and let everyone know because we want to turn out on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| because we want to be dealing with this on the front end and not on the back side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| We don't want to have people being surprised that this was transpiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| So we try to let everybody know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| And by and large, most people are aware of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| And the best thing to do to keep from a forged ballot is to return the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| Have you ever polled the same neighborhood twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| Yes, sir, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| If after a year's period of time they want to go back through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| generally it's because they did not get – I've not had one come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| and want the traffic calming taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| If they want to go back through the process after a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| we allow them to go back through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| I'd like to speak for just a minute in support of these –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| I call them calming devices, two different kinds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| and I'm sure that the county uses them too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| I know the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| They also have what they call rumble strips, which are not near as jarring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| But last Monday morning I was over at Southville Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| from 7 o'clock in the morning until 830,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| and I saw kids across a new crosswalk and two rumble strips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| that I was instrumental in getting put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| and I couldn't count on my hands and toes the number of parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| that rolled down the window and said, thank you, thank you, this is what we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| The only ones that complained were the bus drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| because when you hit that with a school bus, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| it does jack that back end up about two feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| But kids love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Anyway, I'm a firm believer in them in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| But, you know, there are some places where they might be a little superfluous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| but the rumble strips, they're not nearly as offensive and they do work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:44| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| Yeah, I was just going to say, as a car dealer, I deal with cars quite a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| and traditional speed bumps will knock a car out of a line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| You'll lose wheel weights, which puts your tires out of balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| and I don't think they're that effective, traditional-style speed bumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1740)|
| 0:29:08| What I see people do is if you're not familiar with the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| you come running up and you hit the speed bump too hard and damage your car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| and if you are familiar with the area, they'll slam on their brakes right before it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| and then they'll slam on their brakes right after it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| I'm not sure what you're talking about when you said the rumble strips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| but the things that they have on the side of the road of the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| where if you fall asleep and start to veer off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| that does far less damage to a vehicle than traditional speed bumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| and I'm wondering if that wouldn't be cheaper just to cut those ridges in the road at certain places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| Typically, Commissioner, those things are made to alert somebody of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| For instance, when you're using a school zone, it's maybe to alert that you're going into a crosswalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| The problem with using them in the subdivision, as you can hear them on the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| then you create a noise factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| I've got some in my parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| What they're made for is if you're going down a long stretch of road and there's a stop ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| it's to get people thinking what was that, what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| and for them to look up and pay attention to what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| I don't think they're very effective at all in slowing down traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| plus you'll end up with a noise factor inside the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| Mr. Chairman, I really appreciate all the questions we're getting from fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| but it sure would be nice if we'd let the citizens go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| Well, I'm going to let us decide which one we're going to go to first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| Oh, you have something there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Well, you had one more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Only your five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| One of the issues that I would also like to address is how steep our neighborhood is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| Our neighborhood is not a flat neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| Our neighborhood is very steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| So what they have done is they will have an intersection and then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| 100 yards past the intersection there's going to be a speed hump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| and then you have to try to get up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| Well, you're not going to be able to get into our neighborhood if we have snow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| or if we have ice on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| And that's one of the main issues that really has not been addressed or has not been looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| You've got one situation where you've got a steep hill down, it bottoms out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| and then you've got another steep hill back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| They put a speed hump right in the bottom because that didn't exceed the 8% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| Well, the entire hill is greater than an 8% grade, and that's what they need to be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| And they're not looking at that when they, you know, are doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| and laying out where the speed humps can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| They're just trying to block each road into the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| and it's going to be an issue in the winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| Did you have another mail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| Renee Phillips, 1702 Mountain Lake Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| Well, Mr. Weitrick, I have an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| Bruce, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I have a letter that was received by one of our residents whose name actually was forged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| I do have several names of people that were forged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| And that's just with, I've only made 37 phone calls, and I've found five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| When he says that there were, forgive me, I'm nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| I've never spoken in front of such a large group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| When he said that there was no reason to believe in his letter that there was more than just their ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| there was because in their own ballot checking system, I guess you could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| they wrote on their own, does not match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| That means that they received two ballots for one address, and the signatures did not match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| So there's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| We've got upwards of about 20 at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| I'm not saying they're all true forgeries, as I'm calling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| True forgeries are people who chose not to vote and was voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| I have six of those currently, and those people are trying to contact his office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| or in the process of contacting his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| I found three additional yesterday that are in the process of contacting his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| There is a margin of seven ballots between the 70 percent and the 30 or so percent difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:14| There's a margin of seven ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| So if we find 10 forged ballots, are you going to overturn the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:23| Because it's going to get it under your threshold of 70 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Here's where, here's, is when, this is a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| This is not an ordinance or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| I don't have a problem with shelving the entire process and starting the whole thing over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| What I do have a problem with is that when you have that many people been in favor of this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| or in this particular instance, and because they didn't meet the little 70 percent threshold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| we also have in the same policy that the voting ends at a certain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| And we're now into this seven months past that deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| And I don't care to look at everything they have and bring it back to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| and let you all make the call on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| But my whole thing is I'm a little reluctant to shelve the process when I have a super majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| I don't know of any other process where you've got to have that high of an approval rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| Even your own commission, on major issues, is a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| So that's where I've got the problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| Because all I end up doing is I trade these people with another set of people that are going to come down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| complaining that we've now dumped the process for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| So that's where we're caught in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| We're caught in the middle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| And I don't care to go through everything they have and verify it and look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| because at the end of the day we want to do the absolute right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| But it is going to be a tough question if they fall to 65 percent or 60 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| That's going to be a tough call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| And I don't care to bring that call down here and let you all make the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| If you want me to make the call, I'll tell you the call I will make on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| And I feel like we're looking at, here again, an overwhelming majority here is what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:10| And none of this information has been presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| And they're welcome to present that to us, and we'll be glad to go through it and see what we come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| If you would, at the very least, I mean, if there's allegations of voter fraud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| and I know this isn't a presidential campaign and we can't send this to the Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| but if there's some potential voter fraud going on, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| if she presents evidence that certain folks were alleged to have voted a certain way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| and those folks say the opposite, that they didn't vote or they voted a different way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| can you take those out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| We will investigate that. And the fact is we have investigated any that's come to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| And as of me walking in here today, I was only aware of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| We did call other people because we did receive more than one ballot from the household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| It was where a husband had voted and a wife had voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| They can turn over whatever they have. This is all new to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| This is the first I've heard of this, and we'll be glad to look into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| and determine whether or not how they voted or how they wanted their vote to count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| And then we'll see what the total comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| I wish you would look into their allegations of the voter fraud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| and then bring that back to us if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| But I can't call all 280 people in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| That's what they're expecting me to do, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| Well, I'm not expecting them to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| How are we going to find them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| Call 280 people in the subdivision. I'm not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| Isn't there usually just one vote per household and homeowner associations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| So why is there a husband and wife?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| The husband sent in a ballot and the wife sent one in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| They didn't know what they were doing, or maybe they did it on purpose. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| That should be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| It just looks we took care of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| The ones we got two ballots on, we went ahead and verified how they wanted to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| And we've taken care of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| Going back and recounting and calling up 280 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| I just know how it gets with homeowners associations sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| You'll have folks, and I don't want to accuse anybody of voter fraud directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| but you'll have them proxy vote for people who don't understand that they're being proxy voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| Generally, you'll have a neighborhood of 100 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| and you'll have 20 people that show up at the neighborhood association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| And that's why we need to be real careful, especially when we're talking about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:51| You take a few hundred cars and knock them out of alignment for a $70 to $100 front end alignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2271)|
| 0:38:00| that can run into some money for these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| We had a 93% return on voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| Do you know of any election where you've gotten a 93% return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| Not in a homeowners association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| Don't you believe that that's possibly a little too far-fetched?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| I am trying. I'm calling people daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| I do have a full-time job. I have two children in multiple activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| I don't have time for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| My association is not supporting me because everyone on our association voted yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| I went to them. I approached them. Asked them for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| And they said, we've decided to do nothing. Put it on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| I go to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| They said, well, you can go ahead and contact those people if you'd like and get them to call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| Get them to notify us, or we'll send them a copy of their ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| I finally requested a copy of all the ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| I was told at first I could not have them, being that they're public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| At first I was told I could not have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| And then they went back to legal and found out that, yes, in fact, I could have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| as well as I should be able to see the way that people voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| But I am more than okay with not seeing that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| because I don't want to be accused of targeting any particular group when I make these phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| I have been hung up on. I have been supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| It's gone all ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| But like I said, I've only called 37 people, and I've thus far found six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| So you tell me what the percentage is going to be when I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| They have granted us, and I will give them credit for granting me, until September 10th to discover this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| And I'm sorry, gentlemen, I'll try and make this as fast as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| But they have given us until September 10th to try and find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| I just recently found out about this information, and I feel kind of a lone wolf aside from Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| I can't even think of your name, Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| Swan, aside from him and a couple of other people that have finally stepped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| So if 93 percent of the subdivision voted, and I've had five people decide to help and step up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| I mean, it's just that numbers aren't adding up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| I have asked, why don't you do a re-vote with numbered ballots to every home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| to avoid this kind of opportunity for somebody to go and make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| They did provide a list of names of people who had not voted at the very end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| These lists were going out daily from the engineering office saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| here's a list of names of people who have not voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| It encouraged strong arming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| It encouraged forgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| This list went out every day, and I don't know if you find that comical, but I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2424)|
| 0:40:32| They sent out a list every day of names of people who had not voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| Who sent the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| It came from his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| It's public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| But it wasn't public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| But now, Bruce, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| When she requested the ballots, she requested the ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| John Sexton told her she could not have them, and I went to John's office and said, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| she can have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| They're public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| So we corrected that that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| I corrected it, and I corrected it and told John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| I said, no, these are public records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| She can have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| And then who has not voted is also public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| So when people contact us, I told John, I said, you've got to provide them with that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| And the danger of doing this phone balloting and everything else is we've had situations where neighbors have told neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:22| oh, I voted against that traffic calming, when, in fact, we'll get the ballot from them saying, yeah, they voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| They don't want their neighbor to know how to vote because they don't want to get into a confrontation about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| So it's – and that's why we require – that's why we look at a 70 percent majority for these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| But, Bruce, is it common for 93 percent of the people in a neighborhood to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| Because, I mean, again, and I don't want to accuse anybody of voter fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| This just looks like people have been proxy voting for their neighbors who, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| who didn't realize that they were being voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| I'd have to go back and look, but we typically get a fairly large turnout on this because they realize used to that wasn't the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2516)|
| 0:42:04| And they realize we were only going to count the ballots returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| We generally get a fairly high – and I don't know if it's 93 percent or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| but we generally – now we're getting a much higher return because they know we count the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| And if you don't vote, you're not part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| Well, since there is such a discrepancy, can you revote this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| I will review what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| But I am very reluctant to just take it and just say we're just going to start all over again because we've had some complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:31| Because here again, I had 200 – when I walked in here today, I had rough numbers, 200 people voting for this, 80 voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:40| But like I said, Bruce –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| And there's no guarantees on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| But I'm reluctant just to shelve the process and say, well, no, we're just going to start all over because this can come up every single time we do this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:53| I mean, there's a question of whether these votes are authentic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| I could sit down and make you up 200 votes, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're true votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| We verified only – we verified two votes that weren't accurate, and then we changed the record to reflect the accuracy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2582)|
| 0:43:09| I have not had an opportunity to look at anything that they've presented here at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| I don't know what is here, what she was told on the phone or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| We'll be glad to check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| I'm not calling 280 residents in there, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| But I have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Bruce, you said you will check out what she has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| And let us know what you decide to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| Well, I've been in associations where proxy votes had to be notarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| So if you're not at the meeting to vote and you weren't there, you didn't get a choice unless you sent in a proxy vote and it had to be notarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:44| There are empty houses that have ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| Empty homes that have ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| Ma'am, you said you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Not to be a dead horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| Just one quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| An empty house can have a ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| If there is – they don't have to be living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| If they own that house, we will send them a ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| They don't have to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| Ma'am, you said that you would give them all the information that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| I'm sorry, me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Yes, you will give them all the information that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| We're working on it, but I don't think we have enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| I don't have – like I said, I'm the only person making phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| I don't have – I have until September 10th to call 280-some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| What's happening September 10th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| What I think they should do – I think their process is very flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| I think they should number ballots to the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| We return the number ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| If it's a copy and it doesn't have that number on it, it should not be accepted, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| What's happening on September 10th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| You said something about September 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| They've given me until September 10th to discover how many more forged ballots are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| Let's go to the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| What's happening September 10th, Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| What's the September 10th date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| The voting ended on this seven months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| And generally, you've got to snap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| At some point in time, you've got to say, we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| And generally, it's a week – I don't know what our policy is – a week or 30 days after the balloting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| because you'll have people coming in saying, well, I want to change my vote now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| And going back, it never ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| So the voting ended on this six or seven months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| And they started talking about this and said, okay, we'll extend it to September 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| But at some point in time, we've got people who voted for these things and expect to see them being installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| So they have not been installed yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| No, they have not been installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| Bruce, why don't you at least give her until the next commission meeting since we're asking you to report back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| Why don't you give her until the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| That's just a couple more weeks after the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| We have given – so far, this process has gone on for almost seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| We just heard about it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| And like I said, we're asking you for a report on what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| So what would it hurt to give her until the next commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| I'll talk it over with the traffic engineer that's handling this and see what he thinks about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| Because you're just hearing from the people who are opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| That's not necessarily true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| You're not hearing from the people who are in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| That's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| That's not necessarily true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| The people who are in favor of it are expecting this to be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| I honestly think we're opening up a can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| There are people who voted yes, I'm sorry, that are extremely disappointed that somebody decided to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| and could possibly ruin the process for them who did it honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| So there are people who voted yes who are in support of a re-vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| I wish they were here today, and I can't speak for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| But I have spoken to several on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| I think they should do a re-vote with numbered ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| And I think that's the only way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| But I think they're afraid to find out what's going to happen then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| I think they're going to be disappointed with the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| And I think that's what they're afraid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| We have a couple more live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Just let me say that I think we're opening up a can of worms here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| I think we have expressed that we want to let the people over the departments run the departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| We don't want to micromanage county government from this big table here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| And this is getting into that realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| You know, Bruce has a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| We can argue the merits of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| I think it's a pretty good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| It's not perfect, but it's a pretty good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| And he's allowed for some slop in there with that super majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| But for us to put them off another month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| when you may honestly have 200 people that in the end still want this and 85 that don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2855)|
| 0:47:43| I just think this is dangerous ground that we're trading here publicly running Bruce's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| I made agreement with you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| Sam, we've got allegations that this was done improperly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| You know, I just don't think we need to be in a rush to do anything where there's allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| What does it hurt to check it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| What would it hurt to revote it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| If the majority of the people in this neighborhood are for this, what would it hurt to revote it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| They would win on the revote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| You know, I just don't see why there's this, you know, there's allegations that it was improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| And I don't see any problem at all with having a revote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| or at least giving this lady the time to prove the allegations that she's making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| Commissioner Browse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| I'm so sorry this happened in your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| Bruce, you said you've already found two that were forgeries or that weren't votes that should count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| Yeah, and those weren't found just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| Those were found quite some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| Okay, but you found two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| And you're saying that you have evidence of several more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| No, not you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Ma'am, you say you have evidence of several more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| I found three more yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| Okay, well, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| I don't think the county should have to call everybody to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| September 10th is almost three weeks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| And believe me, I've been on the end of the phone having to make 300 calls, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| I know what that's about, but it's doable in that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| With a full-time job and two children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| Yeah, and three kids and running a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| But if there are other people in your neighborhood who are opposed to this, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| they should be willing to step up and help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| And also, Bruce, I would have to say that if they find enough votes that shouldn't be counted as valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| and it brings it below that 70%, then that's the end of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| I think you have to follow your own rules there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| Well, that's part of what I'm saying also, is when you say I've got to follow my own rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| my own rules say the balloting or the voting on this has ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| That it's done, that we declared that this was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| Unfortunately, though, apparently they found evidence of ballot tampering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| When I say these, this is strictly a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| And so I don't know what the numbers are going to show when it's all said and done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| but you still may have a 60% majority in there that wants traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| But what if you did the balloting the first time and it said 60%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| Would you still do it then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| So if they bring back enough forged ballots that it drops it below 70%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| I have not made a decision as to what we think we should do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| We're going to wait and see what the actual count comes back at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| But you will work together to figure out what those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| And even though we sound combative here, I mean, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| We've tried to provide them with all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| Any time that they've sent us something saying we think this is wrong, we've looked into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| and the whole bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| The things I can't get down here and discuss is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| whether traffic calming is going to cause a problem with snow and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| It's really down to about this balloting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| Well, again, I'm really, really sorry that this happened in your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| And I hope that enough of the people who feel the same as you will step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| and help you get all those phone calls made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| and that you all will work together to determine how many votes are valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| and should be counted, and then we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| I guess what I'm saying is that if we didn't have enough people who cared to vote in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| we may not have enough people who care to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| So we don't know that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| We don't know without the time to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| I mean, I have five right here, and I will provide him with copies of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| and these people signed them and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| This is not my signature. Mine is blow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| I've got a couple that did that yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| So there are more, but it is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| And once again, I'm sorry I'm taking up so much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| We just don't know yet. We just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| And I really think that, I mean, I'm okay with a re-vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| Whether I vote yes or no, that is my option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| But I think everybody should have had a voice, and I don't think they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| I think their voice was taken away, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| And this only passed by seven votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| That's why I said there was a margin of seven votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| And that's why when you asked him if it got below the 70% in the original vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| would it have passed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| But if the forged ballots drop it below 70%, why will they continue to put them in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| That's a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| We're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| Are you ready to go into zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| Can we have a recess, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| I think we need to go do the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| We just have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| You need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| Well, we'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| I do what women say, and I'm in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| Well, that's what I did, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| Be rude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:13| Jimmy Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| Hey, dude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| I think you can take a break after zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| Now's the break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| We just need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| We'll kill you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Hey, Finn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Hey, Finn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| We can have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| Me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| If we just step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3222)|

| 0:58:02| We're just asking for applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| I have a couple questions for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| I notice that the survey says 2.98 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| Is that fairly recent and correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| That's based on information we probably got from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| The discussion at MPC, there was some discussion, but I can't really make out what it was, about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| whether it be five or six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| Was there any discussion at MPC that might say why we were saying five or six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| I know you recommended six, but I just wonder what the conversation might have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| Well, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| Five or six units on three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| The staff recommended two dwelling units per acre, and if I could explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| We did see the wisdom in recommending an amendment to the sector plan, a low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| If you look at your map, this is in an area where you have property that abuts low-density residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| You also have a zoning pattern that pretty much surrounds this property that is low-density residential in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3545)|
| 0:59:14| The problem we have is the growth policy plan does not allow consideration of anything above two dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:22| in this particular case because this is not an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| This is in the rural area, but you have a situation where you're in a part of the rural area that is experiencing low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3567)|
| 0:59:34| We can recommend two dwelling units per acre, and that's what staff did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| and the planning commission voted to uphold the staff recommendation of two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3578)|
| 0:59:45| Based on the information provided in the staff report, it's not going to quite allow six dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3585)|
| 0:59:54| but it will allow definitely five dwelling units on the site if it were approved now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| Mr. Chairman, the Metropolitan Planning Commissioner from the 8th District, Miss Becky Longmire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3602)|
| 1:00:12| moved that this be approved, and it was out of MPC at a 10-10 approved, two opposed vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3612)|
| 1:00:21| I'd move that this be approved per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| That's both items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| And that's at the two units per acre then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| Eighteen to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| The next item is 7-C-09-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| This is a request of Frankie Adkins for rezoning from A Agricultural Zone to CA General Business Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| The property is located west side of Tazewell Pike, north of East Emery Road in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| It's the applicant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| Well, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| You told him to stay at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| This is five acres inside a 147-acre overlay that was approved back in 2004 to be zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:36| at property owner request to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| This is at the intersection of Emery Road and Tazewell Pike, Harbinson's Crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:49| As I say, 147 acres in 2004 were approved with an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| Am I correct in that, staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| This was approved back at that time to include this property whenever it was submitted by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| the property owner for commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| It was approved with that plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| You don't have a plan amendment request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| You just have the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| This is also on MPC agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| Motion was made by Ms. Longmire, seconded by Ms. Cole, and I believe it passed unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3739)|
| 1:02:27| I move that this be approved per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| I've got a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| It's not to this at all, but I know that at least last year, Emery Road and Tazewell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3759)|
| 1:02:45| Pike, from a traffic standpoint, I'm sure Commissioner Wright deals with that all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| time, is a very congested area and it really backs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| Is there anything on the books?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| At Harbinson's Crossroads, there is surveying taking place right now by TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| It's probably, though, a year and a half away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| Traffic light and turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| We're through with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| I guess we can go back to, is there anyone for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3805)|
| 1:03:33| No, I think it was in public forum after the rest of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| Well, we wanted to do it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:44| This one you want to do yours, Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| I'm with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| No, you've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| My name is Bradley J. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3834)|
| 1:04:00| Next time, let me say it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| I was going to give you all a background of the story behind this Hall's green waste money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| I was told I had lunch with Rodney Rocket on June the 17th of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| and during that meeting, Rodney told me about a lot of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| and one of the things was that money was being stolen from Hall's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| I brought along some of the documents I checked to establish this and give you a timeline on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3862)|
| 1:04:29| I began to investigate this first by looking at this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| and there's a column there, Knox County solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| This is the column that pays for the Hall's green waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| and I can impute from that about $16,000 a year that should have been collected based on the tipping fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:49| After that, I went to the county detailed revenue report, which is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3889)|
| 1:04:58| and the thing that was really concerning about this is they only showed $3,000 deposited for an entire year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| It should have been $16,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| What was more concerning was they had only budgeted $1,000 for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| So I just can't see how that slipped through the budget, just being honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| Now, Mr. Rocket told me that Mr. Salter had went to a seminar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| and when he went to that seminar, he was informed that if you don't report thefts, you can get in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| The way I understand the timeline is after the seminar, there was another theft in June of $883.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| Here you can see the police report where apparently after the seminar, the thefts began to be reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| This is from William Thomas Salter. It's $883.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| This was reported on June the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| I was curious, and I thought what I would do is experiment and send an open records request to Mr. Salter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| and see if he would be forthcoming about these thefts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| He obviously knew about them. He filed a police report on one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| and I have another document in here that shows a theft as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| and they were obviously known about because there's a police report filed on at least one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| So I sent Mr. Salter an open records request on June the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| Now, this is the bottom of the first page that he sent back to me in certified mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3975)|
| 1:06:24| and I highlighted a section for you to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| Our office keeps records as such as those requested for approximately three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| A report for deposits fees collected at halls for green waste dropped off is attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| These numbers correspond to receivable records available in the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| Now, this is the thing. If you report $883 stolen last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| why would you turn around and send me a certified letter this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| that would seem to suggest that no money was missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4013)|
| 1:06:59| So that made me realize that Mr. Rockett was being fairly straight with me on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4019)|
| 1:07:08| and I met with Larry Smith, and we decided we needed to figure out a way to prove this indisputably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| because apparently solid waste didn't want to admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| Commissioner Smith went to the hall's green waste center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| and collected those green waste receipt books for a six-month sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| We totaled those green waste receipt books to over $8,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| with the assistance of a reporter, the illustrious Larry VanGilder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| So anyway, we compare those to the numbers that Mr. Salter said corresponded in his letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4057)|
| 1:07:44| Here is his letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| And for the entire year of 2009, he has $3,000 deposited for the 2009 fiscal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4068)|
| 1:07:56| How can that be accurate as if the last half of 2009 was $8,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4076)|
| 1:08:03| So Larry Smith goes back to halls, and he obtains affidavits such as this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4083)|
| 1:08:13| recording the existence of the books, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| This is dated July the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| After this was gathered, a reporter, Mr. VanGilder, called Mr. Weitrick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4100)|
| 1:08:29| and informed him that we didn't in fact have copies of the receipt books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| We even made pictures of the first and last page of these receipt books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| So we informed him we had the receipt books for a six-month window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| We could indisputably prove that money was being embezzled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| that a large percentage of it was not reported stolen, and that it was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4126)|
| 1:08:53| And furthermore, we sent an open records request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| and it was disclosed to us in this open records request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| It was the following day, one day after that affidavit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| and one day after this phone call took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| that your solid waste department went public that they had discovered this money stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| July the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| Thank you, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| So I thought I'd let you all know, they kind of had their hand forced on this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| And I can't thank Larry Smith enough for helping me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| but there's the true story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| Your solid waste department knew money was missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| I sent an open records request, and they tried to imply to me to the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| I'm giving you all just a short brief of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| I can go into in-depth detail to the nth degree, as you all probably know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| But I thought I'd give you all a little bit of background on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| Next month, I'm working on another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| It's about $60,000, and I'll probably try to be prepared to give you the information on that next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| But anyway, you all have a great day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| Is there anyone else for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4204)|
| 1:10:12| Tank, could I make one quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| It won't take 15 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| It's very simple to add up those receipt books and compare it to the deposits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| This has been exposed six weeks ago, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| I can take a 10-key calculator and tell you all to the penny how much money has gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| if I'm giving all the receipt books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| And I was curious, why don't we know how much money was stolen yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| It's been six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| This should have been done when this was exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| It should have been done that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| It only takes an hour or so with a 10-key calculator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| If they don't have the time to do it, I'll do it myself for them if they want me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| But they probably don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| But it's very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| There's no reason why we don't know how much money is stolen yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| Are those books still available, 2005, 6, 7, 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| I personally have my suspicion they may have been shredded, but that's just a suspicion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4264)|
| 1:11:11| Commissioner, I can't speak to the historical records and what the state of them might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| What I can tell you is that the matter is under active investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| And you will hear no more from our office about the figures or anything else until that investigation is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:28| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4289)|

| 1:12:05| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| Mr. Law Director, if we revoke a beer permit for a location today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| is the location itself revoked for a certain period of time or just the owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4333)|
| 1:12:22| Generally, it's for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| But it's normally, in terms of the location, if the owner changes, etc., then the subsequent owner can apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4344)|
| 1:12:32| If it's the current owner, then they would not be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4352)|

| 1:14:06| I just want to say that this has gone on for about four months, the committee has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4446)|
| 1:14:23| working on it, and I want to thank publicly Rick Emmett, who chairs the committee, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4463)|
| 1:14:35| Commissioner Carringer and Commissioner Ivan Harmon, Lloyd Dowdy, and a Baker scholar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| There were eight people that wanted to do it at the Baker Center, and Josh Wood was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4480)|
| 1:14:47| picked, and I also was on the committee on a part-time basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| I think they did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| We went through 13 different plans, 13 or 14 different plans, and several, several meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4495)|
| 1:15:03| and I don't think anyone's going to be completely happy, but I think they did the best that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| they could, and this is going to be for one election, and it's going to have to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| again, because the population will shift in the 2010 census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4515)|
| 1:15:22| So I'm going to make a motion for, well, Ivan, you wanted to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| I'll make a motion to approve 3A, Plan 3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| Mr. Chairman, I don't disagree with you about the good work of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| I attended a meeting, asked some questions, but I think it missed an opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4541)|
| 1:15:49| In regards to the Second District, Norwood Library, we will, of course, welcome them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| with open arms, but I thought Gresham was a better add to the Second District, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| thought that a little creativity in that regard could have yielded an even better plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| So I thank those involved, but I think we made a mistake here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| I mean, Second District already has a good chunk of the area represented by Fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| City Town Hall, and Gresham Middle would have made a more logical addition to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| I see Sue Maurer out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| Did you wish to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| I'm Sue Maurer, President of Crestwood Hills Homeowners Association, and we are affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Your address as well, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| Oh, 8824 Farmington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| Our subdivision is affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| They're really not happy about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| I have attended all the meetings, and I know that you want to move us to the 3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4608)|
| 1:16:56| I would like to just put on record that when they come to do the redistricting the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| time with the new figures, that they will put us back into the Fifth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| The lines that are drawn, and I know Greg McKay brought this to my attention, that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| lines need to be straightened up where we could have remained in this Fifth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| The thing that is upsetting to people in our subdivision is the fact that we are a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| large subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| We did not want to be divided, which initially they were going to divide us into two different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| districts, and I said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| So we're happy that we'll be in one, but the thing is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| The Fifth District has been established for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| Our subdivision is over 40 years old, and all of a sudden they decide to pick on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| particular area, which I don't think is really fair, because Farragut was not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4659)|

| 1:19:08| Craig Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| Thank you. This requires a financial report, correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| before the second reading? So we know how much this is going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| I don't know there's any cost involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| Yes, but there is a cost, because you have to notify all of these voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4764)|
| 1:19:29| that they have been moved. All that has to happen. Not one that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| in any way different if we passed one plan over another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| Right. I'm not saying that it's going to make a difference one plan to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| I'm saying we had passed an ordinance saying that any ordinance that's going to cost money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| we have to do a financial study between the first and second readings so that we know how much it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| I see Greg McKay out there. I think he would be the one that would have to get that together for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| Mr. McKay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4799)|
| 1:20:14| We have a series of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| My name is Greg McKay, room 218 in the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| That's where you live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| Mr. McKay, how much will it cost to notify 52,165 voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| Over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| Well, usually when we do a mailing, we'll do a postcard, so you can look at a unit cost of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4839)|
| 1:20:44| what, about 40 to 45 cents, including printing and postage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| I'm not really sure if it's required that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| If you could look that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| We've not moved anybody from where they're voting precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| We're only changing where district they would fall under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| If you move where somebody votes, you have to notify them by law. I'm sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4869)|
| 1:21:14| I'm not sure that we would have to send out 52,000 postcards, but I'll find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| Where they would vote wouldn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| No, that's what I'm saying. It would not change where they vote, what precinct they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| It would only change the district that they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| Can I assure you the candidates running in those districts will let folks know what district they're in and what their options are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| I'll do some more research on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| Can we have Mr. Emmett, who is chairman of the redistricting committee, come down and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| this particular 3A plan in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| the other ones that were looked at, how few voters it moved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| Hi, I'm Rick Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| I live on 400 Main Avenue, so I live here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| We tried to go about it in a geographic way, and I talked to Ms. Mauer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| and several other folks about this all through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| Dr. Lutho, former commissioner Lutho, we talked to as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| We spent a good bit of time to begin with in the committee, and many of you were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| trying to determine some sort of a process that would, at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| we can make some decisions based on some rational, some logical method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| So what we determined was we're going to try to get a plan that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| one, move the fewest people, two, have the lowest standard deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| You can only deviate between districts up to 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| You cannot change precincts, because I believe at that point Mr. McKay was saying that would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| some sort of notification for sure if you change precincts around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| So there's a cost component to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| The fourth area was trying to make sure communities stayed intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| If we're going to move a community to another district, let's try to keep that community together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| That's sort of in the eye of the beholder somewhat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| so we had to rely on folks that actually came to us and told us those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| Then the last criteria was to try to keep incumbents in their districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| Some of the early plans that looked promising actually moved four and five different incumbent commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| into one district and nobody in another, and that didn't seem fair to us either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| So we looked at a whole series of plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| I actually had a couple of plans that it was looking like we were going to go with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| and then the community issue came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| This plan 3A was one that I drew up early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| I did it to make a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| We started trying to see if we could fix some of those problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| and 3A ended up fixing what we felt like was a good number of the issues as far as the communities go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| What it ended up doing, frankly, is it moved around a lot of city precincts and not county precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| That's pretty much the bottom line if you look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| It moved very few people, had a very low standard deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5069)|
| 1:24:35| One component we had to consider was the Voter Rights Act, the minority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| It actually increased that by two percent, up to 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| It's never been that high in Knox County for that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| So that's really why we chose plan 3A at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| It kind of was a dark horse and came from nowhere, as they might say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| But we put it all on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| Everything was out there for everyone to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| Every bit of data was on the Internet the entire time we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| Every meeting was sunshined in the public, and I think that's the first time we've ever done this in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| So I was pretty pleased with the plan we had, and I appreciate everyone's support for it here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5108)|
| 1:25:17| Are there any other questions for Mr. Emmett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| Just one thing, just to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| Although it's been said, it's just for one election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| But before we come back next month, remember that cycle is going to be, for some of the terms, six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5129)|
| 1:25:38| So I just want to remind everybody it's a little more important than just the average one cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5138)|
| 1:25:44| And I think the average one cycle is very important all on its own to make sure we get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5144)|
| 1:25:50| I'm not saying this isn't right, but I do see some flaws in it that I had to support the people in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5150)|
| 1:26:00| 104, page 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5160)|

| 1:27:37| So the litigation fee, your proposal is for how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5257)|
| 1:27:46| It's a graduated dollar for each year and it caps at $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:54| Okay, so they'll be getting $200,000 approximately when we get to the $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| I would assume that if the commission in the future decided that that was enough, they could probably end it with a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5280)|
| 1:28:12| We have Jackie Cottrell here and she could tell you whether or not that amount is more than adequate or they could use even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5292)|
| 1:28:22| I would ask for a budget and I didn't receive anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| I just want to know what we're talking about in terms of money and also a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| So if we could get that before next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| Or do you have the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5315)|
| 1:28:43| We'll make sure that all the commissioners have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| You know, and I guess just to clarify, I'd like to see a budget for all the out years as well because, you know, I'm comfortable with the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5334)|
| 1:29:01| I understand the need, but I'd like to see the subsequent increases, how that budget is going to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5341)|
| 1:29:10| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5350)|
| 1:29:16| Everyone ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| Ordinances on second reading, 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| This is an ordinance amending Knox County Code, Chapter 10, Buildings and Building Regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5368)|
| 1:29:33| Article 9, Swimming Pools, Division 3, Private Swimming Pools, Section 10-238, Fencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| by adding provision approving as an alternative to the mandatory installation of pool walls or fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5379)|
| 1:29:46| The installation of automatic pool covers is approved by the United States Product Safety Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| This amends Ordinance 0-91-3-103, Subsection 2, adopted May 20, 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5392)|
| 1:30:00| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| Governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5403)|
| 1:30:04| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| You know, I've talked about this in committee last month and full commission meeting last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5411)|
| 1:30:19| and committee and finance committee this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| So I've talked a lot about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| I've answered a lot of questions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| So I figured that I would let someone else do the talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| So I'm going to read a few things for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| And this is from the Product Safety Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| Strong advocates of pool safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| They recommend multiple layers of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| But PCS also feel a responsibility to inform customers that all layers of protection are not equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5445)|
| 1:30:52| So then it goes on to talk about fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| And they're advocates of fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| And they also talk about pool alarms, which they're not in favor of, and then winter safety covers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5462)|
| 1:31:11| And then they talk about automatic covers, sometimes referred to as horizontal fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5471)|
| 1:31:17| They provide the best level of protection in that they need the three key points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5477)|
| 1:31:24| They isolate the water, the dangers in the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| They isolate the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| They support the weight of several adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| And three, can be extended in seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| So unlike partially closed gates from a considerable distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5498)|
| 1:31:45| it's obvious to observe whether the cover is open or closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| So and the fact that they ask the question, how effective is an automatic cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5510)|
| 1:31:59| To our knowledge, although hundreds of thousands of automatic pool covers have been installed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5519)|
| 1:32:05| there is no record, there's no recorded incident of a child drowning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5525)|
| 1:32:12| in a pool protected by an American Society of Testing and Materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5532)|
| 1:32:17| We talk a lot about materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| The ASTM, the Materials Society of the United States, approved, certified, functional automatic pool cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5539)|
| 1:32:27| That's a perfect safety record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| Then we go on and talk a little bit about what pool cover, well, what the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5550)|
| 1:32:41| kind of doing a compare and contrast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5561)|
| 1:32:47| And it talks a lot about the power safety cover meeting the pool cover standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5567)|
| 1:32:54| Again, there's, you know, again, I'm trying to answer the question that's been put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5574)|
| 1:33:00| The materials, several adults, okay, use it as a trampoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| These things have been tested, you know, and they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| They open easily and close easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| And then it talks about, you know, how many children under five has died with fence and gated pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5593)|
| 1:33:23| And then, and finally, some people talk about the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| This is going to drive people out of the pool business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| And first and foremost, well, let me answer, we're talking about residential pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| Let me answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| And then we're talking about an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| If a person has a chain link fence, they can keep the chain link fence going about business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| Life for them is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| Okay, this is an option for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| And we're talking about starting at $2,000 to $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5627)|
| 1:33:53| That's where it starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| So we're not talking about putting folks in another, you know, creating this hierarchy where there's only rich people can afford these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5634)|
| 1:34:01| We're talking about, I mean, someone has invested in a pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| They have some means of income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| That is a leisure activity, a recreational activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| So that $2,000 to $5,000 isn't significant investment, but it's not undoable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5650)|
| 1:34:16| So with that said, people ask me why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| You probably don't have a whole lot of residential pools in the first district, and I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| We have several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| But, you know, to me, this is a county issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| This is a child safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| This gives us an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| And I keep saying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| This is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| This is an option for a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| One button, seconds later, you've isolated the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| You never isolate the water with a vertical fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| So I'd like to go ahead and move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| Commissioner Lincoln.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| I actually used to be in the pool business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| In fact, I was selling pools at the same time I was selling cars long before I could even drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5699)|
| 1:35:06| And if I understand correctly, I believe that the state is what regulates that a fence is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5706)|
| 1:35:12| I don't believe that that's county ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| And I want to ask the law director, can air county ordinance trump the state law that requires a fence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| Sir, your code in section 10-238 under fencing reads as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| All swimming pools shall be so walled or fenced so as to prevent uncontrolled access by children from the street or from adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5726)|
| 1:35:34| Such fence or wall shall not be less than four feet in height and shall be maintained in good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| Now, this somewhat parallels state law, except the state law reads that the fence has to be at least five feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5740)|
| 1:35:50| You have a more restrictive ordinance, which you're permitted to do, which actually reads not less than four feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5750)|
| 1:35:56| It's a minor semantic distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| So to answer your question, your code does, in fact, regulate fencing at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| Okay. Can we legally do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| Well, it would be an amendment to your ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| I really think this is a bad idea for a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| Number one, if you forget to close your pool gate, kids driving by that may want to get in that pool, they can visibly see the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5775)|
| 1:36:27| So they think it's locked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| They don't realize that the gate's been left unlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| If someone forgets to close, slide their pool cover over it, they can visibly see that there's absolutely nothing stopping them from getting in the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5794)|
| 1:36:47| Also, you've got situations where a person can fall in the pool between the time that they hit the button and the time that the thing closes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5807)|
| 1:36:56| I mean, you know, you go and you hit your button to close up your pool for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| You realize that you've left your suntan lotion sitting by the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| You bend over to pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| You fall in, and then the thing slides over you, and you've just been trapped in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| You know, I think that this is a fairly new technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| Fences have been around for a long, long time, and that's why the state requires them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| These have not been around quite so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| In fact, they were not even available 20 years ago when I was selling swimming pools, but fences were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5845)|
| 1:37:31| Fences are tried and true technology, and I believe that the state law is pretty specific that a fence is required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5851)|
| 1:37:41| and I think that we are treading on dangerous territory when we make a law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5861)|
| 1:37:50| when we make an ordinance that is different where state law has been very, very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| Now, at some point, you know, the state may decide to start allowing these, but until they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5876)|
| 1:38:02| I think our ordinance need to continue to mirror state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5882)|
| 1:38:09| You've also got a problem with a, you know, yeah, maybe it'll hold three or four adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| If you get the most expensive bottle, but if you get the cheapest model, I'm not sure that it will hold up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5896)|
| 1:38:25| Also, how is Mr. Weitrick going to be able to tell what is in fact a true vertical fence, as you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5905)|
| 1:38:35| the difference between that and simply maybe a self-rollout cover to keep leaves out of the pool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5915)|
| 1:38:44| I think it puts a situation in to where Mr. Weitrick's staff is going to have to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5924)|
| 1:38:50| and determine is this a true certified vertical fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| or is this simply a little cover to keep the leaves out of the pool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5934)|
| 1:38:59| And another problem that we could have with this is I could foresee folks being pushed into getting this by their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5939)|
| 1:39:09| The neighbors say, you know, we're going to fight your swimming pool variants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5949)|
| 1:39:15| unless you get one of these expensive pool covers, because we don't like fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5955)|
| 1:39:23| And I could see some folks being pushed into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| I think we've got a system that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| I don't see any reason why we should change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| If something's not broke, I don't think we need to fix it, and I see nothing here that this fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| Now, I'm not sure why you're bringing this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| It sounds like maybe you know somebody in that industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| But I think our system is working now, and I think we need to stick with the system that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5985)|
| 1:39:52| especially since our system now complies with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| Yes, I want to speak against this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| My concerns are a little bit more practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| I believe that I don't think that Sam's getting ready to go into the pool cover business or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6004)|
| 1:40:12| but I do think that, and I believe all the statistics and numbers that you say, those pool covers are very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6012)|
| 1:40:21| People can walk on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| They're very safe when they're used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| What my concern is isn't some 25-year-old driving by and thinking that he can get in the pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| or having six 30-year-old adults standing on it and collapsing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| I'm not too worried about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| But what I'm worried about is if the phone rings, somebody knocks on the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| and just for a second you say, I'm going to go in and turn off the stove and I'll be right back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| and you don't close the pool cover because you really don't have time to do that when the phone's ringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| or the doorbell's going off, and the three-year-old next door sees no one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| He sees a swimming pool and he's in the thing and drowned in the blink of an eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6058)|
| 1:41:03| I think that a fence is a deterrent to a small child who really doesn't realize what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6063)|
| 1:41:09| Can you leave the gate open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| Yes, but I'm not sure a three-year-old's always looking for the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| But it seems to be, the fences seem to be a very effective way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| The pool covers are good when they're in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| but I just think you have to put the human element in there is where they're not always going to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| And so I'm going to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| Commissioner Luthal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| I'm just going to echo what Dr. Briggs just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| I'm sure when these devices are used properly, they are probably very safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6096)|
| 1:41:45| And as Dr. Briggs brought forward, you decide to go in, grab some lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6105)|
| 1:41:52| and instead of hitting that button, you walk in, I'll be back here in just a few minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| or the phone rings like he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| For whatever reason, you turn your back on it, you don't hit the button, it's not closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:06| and it's just, I just don't think that you leave something up to circumstances that may lead to a tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6126)|
| 1:42:17| A fence is always there, but the cover is not always closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| and that's why I'm going to have to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| I would like to go back to a question that was asked a moment ago by the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| about us making an ordinance that's contrary to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6158)|
| 1:42:44| Where does that put us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| Well, it seems to augment that it doesn't seem to be contrary to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| The state law does at a minimum require a fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6170)|
| 1:42:55| but as a charter county you have an ordinance that likewise requires a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| So if you're going to amend your ordinance, you're giving the citizens a selection, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6180)|
| 1:43:08| But whether or not that's going to be subject to challenge, you know, I couldn't venture to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| We can't alter state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| Well, you can't be in conflict with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| For instance, state law reads the fence has to be five feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| Your ordinance reads it has to be a minimum of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6205)|
| 1:43:30| So in terms of whether or not you're contrary to state law, it's not a case that's been litigated, so that's the dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6210)|
| 1:43:39| If the state law designates it should be a fence, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| State law does use the word fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| It does not address pool covers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| Now, I don't know if that's because this is a recent advent and state law hasn't considered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| I could only venture to presume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| I would say that's probably the case, that that state law is probably several years old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| before they thought of pool covers in this vein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| A problem that I have has been expressed by some is that it can also give you a false sense of security, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:15| What happens if you put the controlling button outside and you don't secure it with a lock or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| where nobody could walk up to your back door and punch the button and open it up while you're not there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6260)|
| 1:44:27| There's a lot more variables than that are human variables where a fence has only one variable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6267)|
| 1:44:36| and that's did I lock the gate or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| So I see it as could be kind of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6279)|
| 1:44:45| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| I don't know who, maybe Sam can answer this, but whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| I did have a couple of calls from hotel motel folks that were concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6293)|
| 1:44:58| Would that be a requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| No, it's residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| Okay, just residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| Did you still have your light on, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| Yes, but I'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| I think I'm plowing ground that's already been worked over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| This is not about the merits of pool covers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| My question, Mr. Law Director, is can a person have a pool cover and no fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6322)|
| 1:45:31| and would we be in violation of state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6331)|
| 1:45:42| It's unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| Again, if it was black and white, I would certainly tell you it's not a matter that's been litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6344)|
| 1:45:51| There's no sensitive case law on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| You could make the argument that it's an alternative to a safety device and it's amending a preexisting ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6353)|
| 1:46:03| I wish there was a more definitive answer because if there was, I would certainly tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| and I would have told you that early on in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| I mean, any time you do something of this nature that has not been definitively reviewed by the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6371)|
| 1:46:18| or the AG or the statute, there's always the inherent danger it could be subject to challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| and there's also the inherent danger of liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6383)|
| 1:46:29| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| I know in years past when we had this women pool, our insurance company required that we have a fence around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6391)|
| 1:46:39| And listen to my co-chair here who's in the insurance business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| obviously your insurance is probably going to be higher without a fence around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| But my biggest point in this is at my house when something breaks, which happens all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6408)|
| 1:46:57| I mean, if your air goes out or your ice maker or your washing machine breaks on the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6417)|
| 1:47:03| it may be several days before you can get a repairman out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| Well, we all know that these fence covers, being electronic and all, I mean, they're going to break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6427)|
| 1:47:13| So what do you do in the meantime if this pool cover breaks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6433)|
| 1:47:20| Yeah, and it's left open and it takes several days to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| and particularly those that may have teenagers and parents are gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6445)|
| 1:47:32| and teenagers get a phone call, they go in, they forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| So I'm going to have to vote no on this because I'm concerned about what do you do when it breaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6457)|
| 1:47:45| and you can't get somebody out there to repair it for three or four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| And we've all been guilty of having our children and something catches our mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6469)|
| 1:47:55| you turn around and they're into something that they shouldn't be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| So I'm going to have to vote no on that because I don't know what you would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| if a repairman couldn't get one right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| I could answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| Again, you know, folks are going to vote how they're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| But in terms of breakage, with every electronic system like that, there is a manual override.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| So you can close the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| There's a manual way to close the pool until the pool repair person comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| So, you know, we're not talking about, we're talking about engineered systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| And when I say engineered systems, these human factors, these human performance factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6506)|
| 1:48:32| they've been thought about, they've been engineered in and out and throughout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| and the materials that are in place that the mechanisms are in place that covers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6517)|
| 1:48:44| So I just wanted to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6529)|
| 1:48:50| We can all think of hypotheticals, and we've just heard some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| But we can also think about hypotheticals on the flaws and failures of fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| This is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| It's a good option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| As noted, it has a manual override.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| As noted, these are very effective because on the scale of proving something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6547)|
| 1:49:14| no proof, your intuition, hypotheticals, examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| and we're finally at the top of proving something are good studies and good descriptive data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6558)|
| 1:49:24| And we have good studies and good descriptive data from the Consumer Product Safety Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6564)|
| 1:49:30| an organization that has been around and studied consumer products for the better part of most of our lifetimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6570)|
| 1:49:36| And it says these products work, work better than fences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:42| and have no record of deaths associated with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| I would think if we lay aside our hypotheticals and think, well, wait a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| our hypotheticals are just how things could play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| How do things actually play out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| And we look at the Consumer Product Safety Commission data cited by Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6594)|
| 1:50:00| we have to say he's made a good idea and he's put it in good form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6600)|
| 1:50:07| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| You know, initially I was for this because I believe in choice and freedom to do with your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6609)|
| 1:50:17| But two things that worry me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| The current code calls for, and I know, Finn, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| the young boy in Fountain City crawled through a hole in a fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| and so the fence is really, it's up to the caretaker of the fence to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6626)|
| 1:50:33| But the fence is their own code to have a self-closing door and a self-locking door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6633)|
| 1:50:40| And I don't believe in hypotheticals because I think accountability is where everything should lie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| and the homeowner should be liable for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| But I think the thing that worries me most about it is it's beyond state law and I don't know that it's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6647)|
| 1:50:55| And so I'm not against it based on the practicality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| I'm against it based on the fact that it oversteps state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| And I don't want to pass an ordinance where I don't completely believe that it's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| I'd like to, I guess, potentially close this because I don't know if we should, you know, vote this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6672)|
| 1:51:18| I can definitely understand what Commissioner Anderson, Commissioner Brown and Wright were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| I don't want to violate state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| I don't know if our charter provision gives us the rights to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| That's always a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| What does a charter give us rights to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| You know, one other thing that came out of this conversation, okay, the state says five feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6694)|
| 1:51:41| We're saying a minimum of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| That seems like conflict there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| What if that thing comes after all this thing, we've got to add another foot to our fence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| I'll do a preemptive apology for that, but, you know, five feet is better than four feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| When we're talking about all these hypotheticals, hey, you know, we can run that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6716)|
| 1:52:03| Several questions came out 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| We didn't have this 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Okay, grandpa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| We didn't have cell phones 20 years ago, really, either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| Okay, we can talk about what happened in the 70s and 80s and how great life was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| But what we're talking about today, we're talking about technology that's advanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| Okay, we didn't have live streaming of county commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| And now, by golly, we've got to talk into a mic if we're going to be at a county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6745)|
| 1:52:30| So things evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| Let's understand that technology evolves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| So this product works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| I guess those are really the only questions that I'm answering, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:41| For the record, I don't have any people or family members or stock in a pool covering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6761)|
| 1:52:47| It might not be a good business to get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| The system works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6772)|
| 1:52:53| It's broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| We just talked about a child dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| We've had three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| Why are you doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| No, it's not about money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| Three kids have died with the ordinance the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| Okay, so is that working well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| Hey, we've got 1,000 pools in the county, 2,000 pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| Only three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| Is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| Three is okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6792)|
| 1:53:15| Again, we're talking about options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| We're talking about options here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| So I want to give folks the tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6798)|
| 1:53:23| And so a couple of things, and then I'll just leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6803)|
| 1:53:32| At the time of the incident, most victims were being supervised by one of most parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| People talk about, you know, leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| That's what we're dealing with today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| 46% of the victims were last seen in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6821)|
| 1:53:49| That's beyond the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6829)|
| 1:53:54| 23% were last seen in the yard or on the porch or in the patio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6834)|
| 1:54:01| And 31% were around the pool after the accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| So they were beyond the gate, beyond the doors of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| Again, this thing isolates the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| Fences don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| So if your son or daughter has a little sleepover, you know, it's hard to isolate the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6853)|
| 1:54:20| It's hard to isolate that water when you're beyond the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| So submersion incidents involving children usually happen in familiar surroundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6863)|
| 1:54:31| So 65% of the incidents happen in a pool owned by the child's family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6871)|
| 1:54:43| We're beyond the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| We're beyond the fence here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| So, again, I just want to make sure that folks understand the fullness of the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6887)|
| 1:54:55| It's great to keep people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| Pool covers isolate the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| So I guess with that, I don't know if I should ask for a 30-day delay on this or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6901)|
| 1:55:08| I mean, with there being a question as far as state law goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6908)|
| 1:55:14| So I'm going to look to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6914)|
| 1:55:20| No, I mean, Commissioner, the bottom line is the state law is silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| It always comes down to the philosophy, are you offering a more restrictive interpretation, which you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6924)|
| 1:55:32| You just can't abate the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| But I can't do any further research on it than we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| I mean, it's just a matter that has never been litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| There's no interpretive history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| There's no legislative history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| Mr. Law Director, Mr. Deputy Law Director, if a product has a so far perfect safety record in significant number of sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6945)|
| 1:55:54| one could argue that is prima facie evidence that it is a more restrictive and therefore within state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6954)|
| 1:56:05| I mean, that's, I think, my point from the beginning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| You can make arguments for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| If I thought it was a matter of that the board would clearly be violating any kind of state statute or ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6969)|
| 1:56:16| I would have told you that from the inception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| So the argument can be made, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| Could we get an opinion from the state AG?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6981)|
| 1:56:27| Whether that qualifies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| And postpone this until then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| Well, he's the one got us in trouble with the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6992)|
| 1:56:39| We don't need to do this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| We need to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| Well, I don't see any more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| Everyone knows what the motion was to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7019)|
| 1:57:00| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| I think we need a roll call vote, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| First district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| Yeah, first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| We might go around pretty strong for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7034)|

| 1:57:45| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| That last argument was pretty good, Sam, but I'll still say no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| but it was pretty persuasive with your statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| Commissioner Briggs votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7073)|

| 1:58:20| Mr. Chairman, can I ask the Law Director something real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7100)|
| 1:58:34| If nothing else, Sam, this has brought up that we do have at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| least a difference in our ordinance in state law, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| would ask the Law Director to investigate what the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7121)|
| 1:58:48| versus our county ordinance to make sure that we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| compliance with state law with our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| We can name that the Sam McKenzie foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| Top of everyone's pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| Let's roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| Well, we own other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7147)|
| 1:59:24| I guess Claude Weems, he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| Before we start on our discussion, I called for them twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| during the redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| That's what they wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| I'm going to ask if there's anybody else that was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| The eight and nine minutes break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7180)|
| 1:59:47| Five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7187)|
| 1:59:54| That's for what I've given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7194)|
| 1:59:55| Granted, everyone will be looking at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| Booty spankings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| Oh, oh, oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7201)|
| 2:00:24| To look into a better way of doing our discretionary money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7224)|
| 2:00:30| because this costs us $700 plus a month just to put it in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| paper as a legal notice, and that's very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7235)|
| 2:00:40| Why can't we do like the obituary notices, put it in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| 25-cent Friday afternoon special?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| It has to be legal notice, but I think there's a better way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| and I think he's looking at other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7249)|
| 2:00:54| And the way they're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| Is there any other way we can, over the Internet or somehow else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7255)|
| 2:01:00| that we can meet the requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| It has to be a better way because that's just costing too much money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| and if we do it twice a month, it's just double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| How does the city do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| Would it be possible to put it on commission form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| He's looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| Tell me any way he can do to save us that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| Did somebody turn the lights up while we were gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| Hopefully very soon we'll know something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| I can't even see you, Mike Hamlin, over there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| Are we on other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| You're complaining?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| I was going to talk about sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| Well, I guess it depends which way the light's reflecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7291)|
| 2:01:39| We're on number one on other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7299)|
| 2:01:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7306)|
| 2:01:47| This is a discussion regarding the 90th anniversary of the TVA and I Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7314)|
| 2:01:57| Send to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7319)|
| 2:02:00| Yes, send it to full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| This is on a lighter and much briefer note than the last few discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| I'm a big advocate of the fair and gone out there every year for 40 years, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7329)|
| 2:02:14| been on their board a few years now, and just want to encourage all members of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7334)|
| 2:02:19| to please go to the fair this year, and especially September 11th, the opening day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| I've prevailed in getting the lunch, opening lunch, moved back from the fourth day of the fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7345)|
| 2:02:31| which was the Monday, to the first day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7351)|
| 2:02:34| Because if some of you recall, eight or ten years ago and back, it was always on the opening day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| and it was a huge crowd with all the politicians and the business people and the carnies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| and everybody showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7364)|
| 2:02:46| So it's going to be September 11th at 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7366)|
| 2:02:49| I hope all of you will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| I've been assured by most of our legislative delegation they'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| Big Joe Armstrong will be cutting the ribbon and telling a few jokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| Of course, it's his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| And Senator Burchett and I've heard a lot of other people from the delegation say they'll come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7381)|
| 2:03:06| I've invited MPC, BCA, people like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| I've invited a lot of business people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| So, anyway, just please come out on September 11th, 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| Parking will be there by the Kerr building or at the entrance over there where the office is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7395)|
| 2:03:21| And I'll have Jolie, three or four days before that, send out an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7401)|
| 2:03:26| And so please just put that on your calendar to come out to the fair lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| I hope we can have a big crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7410)|
| 2:03:32| And the fair won't open until 3 o'clock that day, so it won't be open yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| But you can still walk around, check things out, and go later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7416)|
| 2:03:39| I just have one question, Mr. House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| Since I'll be incapacitated, can I get somebody to bring me to go lunch that day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| I can take a note and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| Why will you be incapacitated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7429)|
| 2:03:51| Surgery or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7431)|
| 2:03:52| The women's caucus will come after him, won't we, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7434)|
| 2:03:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| Commissioner McKenzie, you had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| And it's good to hear that Commissioner Shouse is on the board because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7440)|
| 2:04:05| he talked about how big the opening luncheon was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| You know, this has been one of my, I guess, pet peeves is too strong of a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7448)|
| 2:04:14| And I'm sure Commissioner Andrews may chime in on why that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| But there's something about seeing the midway on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7458)|
| 2:04:23| We have the fairgrounds over there on the, I guess that's the south side of Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7463)|
| 2:04:29| that's not being utilized fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7469)|
| 2:04:32| And it really is a shame, you know, because it's just that festive atmosphere of having two sides to the fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7472)|
| 2:04:40| and you've got rides going on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| And I know they had compelling reasons to, I won't say shrink it, but to move it to one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7482)|
| 2:04:50| But I really wish they would consider, strongly consider, opening up the fairgrounds to the fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7490)|
| 2:04:58| and actually having rides on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| I really think that they would be surprised at the turnout, at the response from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7501)|
| 2:05:08| and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| So, Commissioner Shouse, I challenge you to either invite me to a meeting or present that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7511)|
| 2:05:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| I'll certainly put that in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| Our mutually good friends, John and Evelyn Fortson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7522)|
| 2:05:26| Of course, John's passed away, but I know she had her business there for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| and I'll certainly bring that up at some meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7534)|
| 2:05:39| Are there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7540)|
| 2:05:41| Number two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| Number two is a report and discussion regarding stormwater issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| And the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| And the governmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| And the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7552)|
| 2:05:54| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| First of all, I want to thank Ms. Laura Cole for the many hours that she has been here to discuss this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7555)|
| 2:06:01| So, Ms. Cole, if you would come down to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| As you know, a couple of months ago, she came to our commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| and had given us pictures and was concerned over a runoff and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7568)|
| 2:06:13| and so we wanted to put this back on the agenda so that she could return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| and we could talk about it and have a more lengthy discussion, I guess, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| about what we as government can do to help our constituents when they're having these types of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| And I've traded e-mails with Ms. Cole, and you had some specific ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7586)|
| 2:06:30| but I wanted you to just have this opportunity to tell us or share with us whatever you'd like to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7590)|
| 2:06:35| Well, I think what I'd like to do is talk about two separate issues regarding stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7595)|
| 2:06:41| There's my specific issue, which, of course, I'd like to be solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7601)|
| 2:06:45| But the bigger issue is the entire development process and how we manage stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7605)|
| 2:06:53| So while I'd like commission to help me resolve my problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| I'd also like commission to take a look at changing the whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| because it has a huge impact on the citizens of Knox County overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| I'd like to see some changes in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| We know we have some gaps in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| One of the big problems with the whole development process is I think the planners who come up with the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7630)|
| 2:07:17| are completely separated from the enforcement staff that is on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7637)|
| 2:07:23| So you've got people looking at the paper plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| and they don't have a lot of discussion with the people who are trying to enforce those plans on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| And I'd like to see a change in the way we approach development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| I'd like to see a review process at the planning phase that allows the stormwater folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7655)|
| 2:07:43| the people who have to review and enforce the plans and the regulations that go along with those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7663)|
| 2:07:48| I'd like to see an early discussion before we set zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| And I know that there's probably going to be some barriers to changing that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7673)|
| 2:07:58| but that's one of the most important things I see is getting those people in front of the development before ground is broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7678)|
| 2:08:05| Because once it's broken, there's not a lot you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| And obviously enforcement isn't working as well as we'd like it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7688)|
| 2:08:12| So I'd like to see a much more proactive approach to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7692)|
| 2:08:19| Of course, I'd like to see enforcement strengthened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| I'd like to see some performance measures that we can use that lets us know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7701)|
| 2:08:27| are we doing a good job with stormwater management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| What is good stormwater management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| How do we know we're doing it correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| Those performance measures are something I think that commissioners can use in terms of getting reports on how we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7715)|
| 2:08:42| Where are the problem areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| Where are the failures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| Those are the things I'd like to see, and I think that's got the biggest impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7726)|
| 2:08:52| So I see those as two separate issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| and I'd like for commission to think about maybe working with stormwater folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| maybe some workshops to help us take into account the changes that are going to come with regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| Because there are some regulations on the horizon that are going to be much stricter for us than they have been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7746)|
| 2:09:14| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7755)|
| 2:09:16| How can we specifically help you with your problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7756)|
| 2:09:21| Well, I've met with Chris Gronju and Commissioner Armstrong, and we've discussed some options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7761)|
| 2:09:29| Of course, I would like the runoff problems to stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7769)|
| 2:09:34| but I don't know how to tell you to address those issues other than to let the stormwater folks speak to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7774)|
| 2:09:39| because they're the ones that have to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| So I'd like to defer to Chris on what can be done for my property to solve that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7781)|
| 2:09:52| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| Yes, Chris will come down while he's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| I've spoken with, first of all, I'd like to say thanks to Ms. Cole for coming down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7798)|
| 2:10:03| and keeping this foremost in our mind, because I would totally agree with her that we have a serious problem in our process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7803)|
| 2:10:13| I guess is the best way to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| But we have been talking with Chris and his group, and we're working on trying to set up a workshop to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7815)|
| 2:10:25| and try to hammer out some answers to some of these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| And I hope we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| He said he's going to work on it and get it, you know, done for us pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| And I would encourage as many of us that can be there to see what these problems are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7835)|
| 2:10:41| and take a look at this process the way it's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| I would agree with Ms. Cole in the fact that stormwater needs to be in on the front end of the planning also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7843)|
| 2:10:50| I mean, if a planner sits over here and says, well, I think this will work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| and stormwater says it won't work after it's done, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7853)|
| 2:10:57| we have a serious problem that could have been negated if we had worked together from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7857)|
| 2:11:02| The second thing is that, as she mentioned, once the ground is broken, it's too late to do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7862)|
| 2:11:12| And in talking with Chris, they don't have the enforcement people to be on site more than maybe once, twice a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7872)|
| 2:11:22| Some of these, they need to be on those sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| They need to have somebody on site looking at that, those projects as they progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7885)|
| 2:11:31| at least two, three times a week in order to stave off some of these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7891)|
| 2:11:37| Because those of you that have been in construction or been around construction know you can move a heck of a lot of dirt in two days' time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7897)|
| 2:11:44| So this has caused a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| And I think if we get this workshop together, it's been a long time coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| We've looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7910)|
| 2:11:51| You know, this has been a longstanding issue that if we can get together and work out some of these processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7911)|
| 2:11:57| probably, you know, we talked about having the MPC folks, the commission, stormwater folks, even city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7917)|
| 2:12:05| get a general governmental workshop on this problem because, as we've talked about several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7925)|
| 2:12:13| all the good stuff, all the good properties in Knox County has been developed, all the easy stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7933)|
| 2:12:19| Now, from here on out, it's going to be the hard stuff because they always leave it to last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7939)|
| 2:12:24| And it's the ones we're going to have the most problems with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7944)|
| 2:12:27| And if we don't get on that up front, we're going to be really in some serious problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| We just, you know, every time we turn around, we've got money we're going to have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| we just $168,000 today for a retention pond on something that could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7956)|
| 2:12:42| and should have been taken care of possibly when that subdivision was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7962)|
| 2:12:46| And that subdivision has been in there for 30 years anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7966)|
| 2:12:51| So we've got some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| And I'd like for Chris to maybe end his answer to Miss Laura to kind of address what we talked about too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7973)|
| 2:13:01| Mr. Chairman, point of order, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| Are we going to take Miss, I mean, it doesn't matter to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7985)|
| 2:13:08| are we going to take Miss Cole's particular issue first because we're back and forth a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7988)|
| 2:13:16| So she presented to us a process problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=7996)|
| 2:13:21| And then we presented her situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| Now we're back talking process and what to do with stormwater in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| So I just want the, let's just focus on one thing at a time I think would be more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8008)|
| 2:13:39| Commissioner Hammond, this is your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| If we could, I'd like to address Miss Cole's specific problem first before we go into process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8022)|
| 2:13:47| because that's really why she came down in the beginning was because she was having issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8027)|
| 2:13:51| If that's okay with commission, I'd like to address that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8031)|
| 2:13:55| We're going with process first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| No, Miss Cole's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| That's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| Go in front of those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8046)|
| 2:14:09| Again, Chris Grangeau, Stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8049)|
| 2:14:13| We met, we did meet last week, and the decision was made to get a representative from a program called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8053)|
| 2:14:20| the Tennessee Stream Mitigation Program to come out and view the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| They specialize in pretty high-tech or at least advanced design stream restoration, stream mitigation projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8064)|
| 2:14:34| and I believe one of the projects that they did in this area is the Third Creek around the Greenway Trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8074)|
| 2:14:42| restoration project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| Some of you may be familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| And I think we're looking at it at the angle of obviously we're talking about process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8086)|
| 2:14:52| I think we're trying to find a solution, and we've certainly chased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8092)|
| 2:14:57| and will continue to chase whatever enforcement issues remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8097)|
| 2:15:01| But at this point, there are no great enforcement issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| Most of the site is relatively stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| There are going to be building permits that are pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| There may be minor issues, and we'll deal with them along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| But what the photos you've seen seem to indicate is that there's some lasting stream impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8112)|
| 2:15:19| A program or an approach like the Stream Mitigation Program can offer may be the only viable solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8119)|
| 2:15:27| So the first step is to get out there, walk the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8127)|
| 2:15:30| We do have to have willing property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8130)|
| 2:15:33| I think there's actually three property owners involved, including Ms. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| And if it all comes together, we may have a really nice project out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8138)|
| 2:15:47| Let me speak to the process that she was talking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| I don't want anyone led to believe that we don't work with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| In fact, my staff goes out with them literally every month to look at new subdivisions and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8153)|
| 2:16:00| The thing about drainage and engineering design where that doesn't kick in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8160)|
| 2:16:05| until actually an actual plan is submitted to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| Rarely are we going to be able to walk on a piece of property and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| no matter what you do here, you're going to have a drainage problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| I mean, some properties, that's pretty evident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| Most properties, yeah, as long as you do certain things, you're not going to have a drainage problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8177)|
| 2:16:22| However, that's a detailed engineering design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| And typically, we don't get those plans until after the property is rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8185)|
| 2:16:30| and after the concept plan has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| Then that's when we get those engineered plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8193)|
| 2:16:36| Now, if I understand Ms. Cole, and she's here obviously to speak for herself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8196)|
| 2:16:40| I think she wants to see that sooner in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| those engineering design drawings done sooner in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| not only to give us an opportunity to review them sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| but also let neighbors know what they can expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8209)|
| 2:16:52| Because I've had some neighbors quite surprised that they didn't realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8212)|
| 2:16:55| they were going to lower this slope about 20 feet and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8215)|
| 2:16:59| But as far as engineering and public works and stormwater is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8219)|
| 2:17:05| those plans can arrive to us at any point during that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8225)|
| 2:17:08| whether it's a front end, whenever, and that's when we'll do the review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8228)|
| 2:17:12| Bruce, could you stay with Ms. Cole, though, please, just for my line of thought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8232)|
| 2:17:18| I mean, her, I don't mean to interject, but I just want to stay with her issue first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8238)|
| 2:17:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8244)|
| 2:17:25| Well, Chris pretty much, that's what Chris was addressing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| was essentially what she was talking about in regards to her specific problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8247)|
| 2:17:36| As we said, we're on Ms. Cole's issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| Is that what you want to speak on, Commissioner Lupo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| No, I was going to talk about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| I mean, on behalf of Ms. Cole, I think this has been ongoing far too long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8263)|
| 2:17:48| and we need to get it resolved, whatever we've got to do to get it resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| But I've got my light on to talk about the process, so when we get back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8273)|
| 2:17:58| Commissioner Andrews, Mr. Cole's situation, Dr. Briggs, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8278)|
| 2:18:09| I haven't been out and inspected this site physically myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8289)|
| 2:18:12| but I've looked at your pictures and I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| has somebody posted pictures of your stream problem on the Internet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8294)|
| 2:18:20| I've seen some video of a problem and I just want to make sure it's the one that I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8300)|
| 2:18:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8306)|
| 2:18:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| I've posted pictures and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8308)|
| 2:18:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8309)|
| 2:18:30| And there is some video out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8310)|
| 2:18:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8311)|
| 2:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8312)|
| 2:18:33| What I see with this problem is it looks to me like there was probably a pretty serious failure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8313)|
| 2:18:40| of somebody's retention pond and it has dumped red mud into her stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8320)|
| 2:18:45| And so not only does she have the problem that's probably to a lesser degree now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8325)|
| 2:18:50| if what I was seeing was an accurate representation of the way it usually is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8330)|
| 2:18:55| there's probably less brown water flowing into your creek now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8335)|
| 2:19:02| but that it's stirring up the mud from the bottom of this creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8342)|
| 2:19:07| And I think that she's been damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| If it's the one I believe I've seen, I believe that she's been pretty seriously damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8349)|
| 2:19:14| And what I'm wondering is, is there any way that we can sue the developer that damaged this stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8354)|
| 2:19:25| I mean, I hate to ask Ms. Cole to take out a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8365)|
| 2:19:31| She can't afford it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8373)|
| 2:19:34| Is there any way that the county can sue to get some compensation to help us pay for the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8374)|
| 2:19:40| Because I'm not an expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| but it just seems to me like it's going to be pretty expensive to go in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| and dig out that red clay that has flown into this creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8386)|
| 2:19:52| And I don't think it's going to ever get any better until it's physically cleaned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8392)|
| 2:19:58| I think that if we could completely stop any more mud from going into that creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8398)|
| 2:20:03| I think that every time it rains, it's going to stir up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| Every time a cow or a horse starts drinking out of that water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8406)|
| 2:20:11| it's going to stir up the red clay and make it that caramel color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8411)|
| 2:20:16| Is there anything that we can do to see that the person who caused this damage has to pay to clean up the mess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8416)|
| 2:20:28| Are you directing that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8428)|
| 2:20:29| No, no, I'm directing it to Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:30| I think that should be a question directed to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| The problem you have is this, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| Tennessee law prohibits government from using public funds for private interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8439)|
| 2:20:44| or in other words, lending our credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| Unless we can demonstrate that the entity or the developer is violating a county code section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8446)|
| 2:20:53| then we have the power to enjoin him from doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8453)|
| 2:20:56| In other words, asking the court to enjoin him by way of injunctive relief, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8456)|
| 2:21:00| But we normally can't stand in the shoes of a private citizen and sue for private damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8460)|
| 2:21:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8465)|
| 2:21:06| Is there anything under any kind of environmental law that we can seek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8466)|
| 2:21:10| I mean, because I think it's going to cost some money to clean this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8470)|
| 2:21:14| And is there any mechanism that we can use to see that the developer that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8474)|
| 2:21:20| and it was probably an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8480)|
| 2:21:21| I don't think they did it on purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| I just don't, I'm looking at probably tens of thousands of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8483)|
| 2:21:28| if not $100,000 worth of work that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| And I hate to put that on the taxpayers when it was negligence on behalf of an adjoining subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8492)|
| 2:21:39| And, again, I'm probably one of the most pro-development folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8499)|
| 2:21:45| But we've got to see that these folks obey the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| And that if they don't obey the law, that the problems that they create are fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8508)|
| 2:21:52| And I don't think the taxpayers should necessarily have to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8512)|
| 2:21:56| I think that if, is there any mechanism that we can use to go after this without asking Miss Cole to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8516)|
| 2:22:03| at her own expense, file a lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| Well, the operative language of the Youth Commissioner is that if they have violated the law, and that's the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8525)|
| 2:22:10| It's one thing if one landowner does something injurious to another landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| That's a private civil matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| If we can demonstrate that the developer, for instance, violated county codes and didn't remedy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8535)|
| 2:22:21| did anything violative of county law, then we can possibly step in and seek redress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8541)|
| 2:22:28| If we have state law issues, then we can refer it to either the state environmental protection entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8548)|
| 2:22:35| or even the state attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8555)|
| 2:22:38| But, again, we would have to be comfortable that it is, in fact, a violation of county law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8558)|
| 2:22:45| Commissioner, I think to answer your question that what Chris was talking about first, about the stream mitigation program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8565)|
| 2:22:51| that's what essentially they're going to do is they're going to go out there and look at that, and that's a no cost program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| I don't know that the county can sue on behalf, but that's where we're headed with it is to get it corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8576)|
| 2:23:02| There will be no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8582)|
| 2:23:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8583)|
| 2:23:05| Commissioner Armstrong, did you want to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8587)|
| 2:23:10| First off, I would like to, at this point, commend Bruce and Chris for the work they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8590)|
| 2:23:15| I know I have been a royal pain in their butt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8595)|
| 2:23:20| Again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8601)|
| 2:23:22| But I do know that they have tried their best to work with me and work with Ms. Cole on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8602)|
| 2:23:27| and I want to commend them on the strategies, Chris, that you've come up with, and we'll have to see if it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8607)|
| 2:23:35| But right now the plan is, as Chris said, you know, is to try to straighten out Ms. Cole's situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8615)|
| 2:23:44| And the only reason that I personally, in a way, picked this one, and this one is more dear to my heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8624)|
| 2:23:50| is because that when I know this particular piece of property personally, and before this activity began,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8630)|
| 2:23:59| you could drink out of that stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| I mean, it was just crystal clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| And on the backside, it's still crystal clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| We're looking at a phase two being approved for the backside of this same project, which could run the backside of the farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8646)|
| 2:24:14| And I was so impressed with Laura and John's work in their stream when they got the farm and were cleaning up the farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8654)|
| 2:24:22| Their utility crossings and animal crossings in their streams are textbook environmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8662)|
| 2:24:31| I mean, beyond what I have ever seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8671)|
| 2:24:34| And then for things to be allowed to come in and basically destroy their dream and their work and their environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8674)|
| 2:24:43| so somebody else can make a little extra money was a little bit more than I could stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8683)|
| 2:24:46| and I probably got a little hot about it than I normally would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8686)|
| 2:24:51| But I think that we're on the right path right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| I think that I hope that county commission will stick with us in this endeavor where we can deal with processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8694)|
| 2:25:00| where we can help this particular opportunity for us could be a demonstration for us to learn from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8700)|
| 2:25:07| and maybe develop better policies, develop better processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8707)|
| 2:25:12| We talk about audit committees and other committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| Maybe we need some engineers as a committee to support what we have here because we have limited resources out in Bruce's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8714)|
| 2:25:23| That's something else we'll probably talk about down the road when times pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8723)|
| 2:25:29| But when times go bad, like they are right now, and we get a lot of abandonment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8729)|
| 2:25:35| and we get a lot of failures due to deterioration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| and then we get a lot of failures due because we have non-developers becoming developers and messing everything up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8738)|
| 2:25:45| and I think that's what probably happened more in Ms. Cole's situation than maybe other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8745)|
| 2:25:51| I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank Bruce and thank Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| I'm very optimistic on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8754)|
| 2:25:56| Chris, as you know, I'm trusting you and I'm leaning you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8756)|
| 2:26:00| You're my engineer, and I think good things can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8760)|
| 2:26:05| I think we can make a model program out of this, and I think it's worthy to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8765)|
| 2:26:10| I hope we can learn some things that we can internalize in our designs as far as MPC is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8770)|
| 2:26:16| as far as our approval processes are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8776)|
| 2:26:19| This is just really an opportunity that we as a community should embrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8779)|
| 2:26:23| As we get her property fixed, we can learn about mitigation and remediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| and at the same time we can learn about root cause analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8788)|
| 2:26:32| and maybe in our processes avoid these root causes that ended up in this great of a disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8792)|
| 2:26:40| I'm going to get off my soapbox, but there was a time before in this forum that I got a little on the edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8800)|
| 2:26:46| and I think when things are coming together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| I think I should use this same forum to applaud the people that are trying to step up and help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8808)|
| 2:26:54| And so I want to say to Bruce and to Chris, I appreciate your energy that you put in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8814)|
| 2:27:01| and your tolerance in dealing with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8821)|
| 2:27:07| This looks like an excellent stopping place right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| Why don't we just call it a night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8830)|
| 2:27:14| But I wanted to close with my always jab here is I have great expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8834)|
| 2:27:19| and I appreciate you when you will fill those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8839)|
| 2:27:22| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8842)|
| 2:27:25| Commissioner Norman, did you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| I'm glad that Commissioner Armstrong mentioned the farm, Miss Cole's farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8851)|
| 2:27:41| and how it really is an example, I think, for us in the county for rural land, agricultural land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8861)|
| 2:27:48| and they're an example of an agricultural practice or an agricultural setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8868)|
| 2:27:54| where they truly try to do environmentally sound or employ environmentally sound practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8874)|
| 2:28:05| That is not true in a lot of agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| I think, what are the two worst polluters in Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8889)|
| 2:28:13| It's the Tennessee Department of Transportation and farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8893)|
| 2:28:17| And then developers are up there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8897)|
| 2:28:21| But it really is a model situation for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8901)|
| 2:28:29| And because of that and because of the length of the time we've been talking about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8909)|
| 2:28:35| and dealing with this, I'd just like to see something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8915)|
| 2:28:38| I'd like for Bruce or Chris to tell us, what can we do on the short term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8918)|
| 2:28:43| Like this month, what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| If it's TSMP, can TSMP come in and do a, is it reasonable for them to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8925)|
| 2:28:55| and do a geotech on this sinkhole issue, disappearing creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| We don't know where the sediment's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8940)|
| 2:29:03| But it seems like we need to be doing something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8943)|
| 2:29:07| and we need to give Ms. Cole some assurance that there is something tangible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8947)|
| 2:29:13| that's going to take place on the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8953)|
| 2:29:16| And that's what I hope we can say to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8956)|
| 2:29:19| Go ahead. Thanks, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| Well, since we met last week, I've exchanged messages with the representative from that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8961)|
| 2:29:27| and actually got an email requesting some specific information on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| while I was at the meeting here that I forwarded to somebody to start compiling the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8971)|
| 2:29:37| So there are factors beyond my control, so I'm not really in a position to promise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8977)|
| 2:29:43| but I would hope that this time next month, what kind of options are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8983)|
| 2:29:50| with the Tennessee Stream Mitigation Program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8990)|
| 2:29:53| Okay, if we can't get on their calendar, who can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8993)|
| 2:29:57| I mean, if this was a priority for this commission and the commission said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=8997)|
| 2:30:01| yeah, we need something done here and we need it done quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9001)|
| 2:30:05| what kind of options do we have for geotech services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9005)|
| 2:30:10| Because essentially that's the problem there at whatever that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9010)|
| 2:30:14| lot number 17, draining in the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9014)|
| 2:30:17| Isn't that the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| Well, I think that it maybe sort of defies your desire to separate these into two topics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9019)|
| 2:30:26| because I think what we come down to is that we look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9026)|
| 2:30:31| and maybe the standard for a county lawsuit is a situation of noncompliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9031)|
| 2:30:37| and there's really not an issue of noncompliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9037)|
| 2:30:41| or the issues of noncompliance aren't proportional with the impact that we're seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9041)|
| 2:30:47| which sort of leads us to that whole situation of looking at the process and the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9047)|
| 2:30:52| and how planning ties into stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9052)|
| 2:30:57| Going back to the Stream Mitigation Program and other options, it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9057)|
| 2:31:07| So have you talked to BABIT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9067)|
| 2:31:08| Has BABIT said we can come out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9070)|
| 2:31:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9071)|
| 2:31:12| Is he giving you a time frame for when he can come out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| No, we need to get property owner information, maps, stream miles, the basic information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9074)|
| 2:31:22| which isn't difficult to get, and it's not difficult to put together a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9082)|
| 2:31:29| It's just we met, I guess, three working days ago, so it just doesn't happen that fast sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9089)|
| 2:31:37| But it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9097)|
| 2:31:38| Is this the right step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9098)|
| 2:31:40| Is this the next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9100)|
| 2:31:41| Is this the way, in your estimation, that we should go to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9101)|
| 2:31:47| yes, Ms. Cole, we're concerned and we think this is the way to go next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9107)|
| 2:31:51| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9111)|
| 2:31:52| I think that when you look at a situation, you say that there's really not a state of noncompliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9112)|
| 2:31:57| and that's what I keep coming back to at the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9117)|
| 2:32:00| then there may not be a party to point fingers at and say, you know, this person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9120)|
| 2:32:05| and so that leaves it to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9125)|
| 2:32:09| And, you know, the stream mitigation program basically acts as a grant of sorts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9129)|
| 2:32:15| I don't know the particulars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9135)|
| 2:32:18| You may be more versed on the monetary side of it than I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9138)|
| 2:32:22| but I know that for the applicant there's no cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| and that certainly makes it a far more desirable solution than contracting any of the number of engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9145)|
| 2:32:35| or bioengineering companies that may have the same expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9155)|
| 2:32:39| In your discussions with Mr. Babb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9159)|
| 2:32:42| was he able to give you any indication of when he might be able to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9162)|
| 2:32:47| given we do our side of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9167)|
| 2:32:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9171)|
| 2:32:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9172)|
| 2:32:53| I have no indication of time frame for a meeting or project or a queuing of a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9173)|
| 2:33:00| As I said, we've actually left messages back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9180)|
| 2:33:03| and just finally resorted to email today, so that actually works better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9183)|
| 2:33:11| Well, I'm still not getting an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9191)|
| 2:33:16| If we know we want to go this route and it seems like this is the proper thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9196)|
| 2:33:24| then what would be a reasonable time frame to get it done, in your estimation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9204)|
| 2:33:35| He said six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| I was hoping something a little better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| Six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9219)|
| 2:33:40| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9220)|
| 2:33:41| I don't know what a reasonable time frame is to get a project like that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9221)|
| 2:33:46| If you're dealing with – there could be any number of factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9226)|
| 2:33:53| I don't know what a reasonable –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9233)|
| 2:33:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9236)|
| 2:33:57| So we're working towards this in this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9237)|
| 2:34:00| and you're going to get back to us and tell us where we are in the process in the next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9240)|
| 2:34:05| and if we can get it done in this month, we'll get it done in this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9245)|
| 2:34:10| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9250)|
| 2:34:12| But we're going that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9252)|
| 2:34:14| We're on a track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9254)|
| 2:34:16| I think part of the problem is we've never really gone through this type of process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9256)|
| 2:34:19| and so we're just kind of reluctant because we're not the ones –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9259)|
| 2:34:22| I mean, if I had a consultant that I was going out and hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9262)|
| 2:34:25| I could probably give you a more definitive answer, but we're –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9265)|
| 2:34:28| Chris could give you a more definitive answer, but this is kind of new to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| so it's really going to be up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9272)|
| 2:34:33| Once we hear from them and able to talk to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9273)|
| 2:34:36| and make sure it's a project that they say, yeah, we'll do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| then we can get you a more definitive timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9278)|
| 2:34:41| If we did do a consultant, do we have any idea of cost for this type of survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9281)|
| 2:34:49| Commissioner Lambert's estimate was probably a bit low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9289)|
| 2:34:53| Which was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9293)|
| 2:34:56| $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| It's pretty expensive work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| Grant, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9301)|
| 2:35:03| This is what I think needs – Chris, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9303)|
| 2:35:07| This is what I think needs to be done, and this is where I'm getting that estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9307)|
| 2:35:10| and again, this is just off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9310)|
| 2:35:12| It looks to me like you're going to have to temporarily divert the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9312)|
| 2:35:17| so you can get access to the creek bed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9317)|
| 2:35:20| and then you're going to have to go in there with probably human beings with shovels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9320)|
| 2:35:25| getting the red clay out, because if you went in there with a backhoe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9325)|
| 2:35:29| you're going to dig the clay out, you're going to dig the bottom of the bed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| and get down to guess what, more red clay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| So, I mean, I think this is something that's going to take a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| and it's going to take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9338)|
| 2:35:40| So that's – I mean, this is – I mean, this is serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9340)|
| 2:35:45| and I think somebody needs to pay for it other than the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9345)|
| 2:35:49| And that's the route we're headed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9349)|
| 2:35:51| We just – in dealing with the other agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9351)|
| 2:35:55| we just can't give you a definitive timetable as to how long it's going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9355)|
| 2:35:59| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9359)|
| 2:36:01| I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9361)|
| 2:36:02| This may help you get an answer to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9362)|
| 2:36:05| I think if we were ready to go, if we said we want to pay for it, money's no issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9365)|
| 2:36:09| we'd still be looking at six months maybe the ideal time to do something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9369)|
| 2:36:14| with the planning would be doing it during the winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9374)|
| 2:36:17| But we would be hard-pressed to get a set of plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9377)|
| 2:36:20| get all the permitting in place to be able to actually start work that soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9380)|
| 2:36:25| But how the TSMP program works, as Bruce said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9385)|
| 2:36:36| I give temporarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9396)|
| 2:36:41| Commissioner Ivan, did you want to address Ms. Calls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9401)|
| 2:36:45| Well, the calls and then also some of the solutions maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9405)|
| 2:36:49| Do you all issue bonds when they build a development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9409)|
| 2:36:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9413)|
| 2:36:54| What size of bond did you have on this development, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9417)|
| 2:36:59| Have you already released the bond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9419)|
| 2:37:05| There may be a remaining bond for the hydrology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9425)|
| 2:37:10| It does not have an environmental bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| Could you use that bond to repair this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9432)|
