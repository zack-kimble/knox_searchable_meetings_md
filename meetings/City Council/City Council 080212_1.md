| 2:05:27| And, you know, you go around here, too many people got a whole lot of bad to say about Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7527)|
| 2:05:31| They say, yeah, he'll talk some stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| But I'm going to finish up in a minute here, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| But I just want to give you how I feel about this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| You know, because nobody gives you any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| You go over to South Mountain for Waterfront, you think that's your baby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| Sir, get real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| That's Joe Holquist's baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7552)|
| 2:05:54| That's his legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| Oh, your name will be on the marquee, but those of us still be alive the next 25, 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7555)|
| 2:06:01| we know that that's Holquist's baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| Only legacy you got, sir, is that dog on theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| Only other legacy you got right now is going for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| You give a tip to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| You know, and you and Dr. Lyons, this is what it really gets me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| I read an article a few months back in the editorial part of the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| See, the Sentinels never get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| Like, they jumped on Randall and sent defense mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7584)|
| 2:06:27| They won't jump on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7587)|
| 2:06:28| Because y'all walking around, certain members of this council walking around like they squeaky clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7588)|
| 2:06:33| But, Mr. Mayor, check this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| This is a good one for the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7596)|
| 2:06:39| You giving another tilt to that State Street project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7599)|
| 2:06:43| You and Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| He got his hands in it more than you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| Because, you know, I read an editorial one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7607)|
| 2:06:52| You know how they give the citizens certain days to do editorials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| And it was during the weekday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| And a lady had written and said, who's running city government, Haslam or Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| I pulled that article out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| And, you know, and I'm going to give this stuff a lot of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| And I said, man, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| Mr. Mayor, you're supposed to be for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7629)|
| 2:07:12| If you were for the people, like you say you are, and this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| you would not put a 200-bed hotel over on that State Street project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7636)|
| 2:07:22| Hey, us citizens, we're not stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7642)|
| 2:07:25| A lot of them look at Channel 12 and they take part whether they come up here and speak out like I do or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7645)|
| 2:07:31| Mr. Mayor, give me one minute because I'm going home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| Hey, Mr. Mayor, but you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| What you just done right there, you smiling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| but you and this council are underhanding the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7659)|
| 2:07:44| See, because they voted on referendum, not for another hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7664)|
| 2:07:48| When you got all these hotels up here, the Hilton, Crown Plaza, all these different hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7668)|
| 2:07:54| and they're not even filling their beds to capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| And then you put in the piece, in the op-ed, that y'all going to sit there and build a catwalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7677)|
| 2:08:03| from the hotel on State Street to the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| Man, if that's not a convention center hotel, whether taxpayer money is involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7688)|
| 2:08:13| if they're going to build that project, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| if they're going to build that project on State Street, y'all have to, Dr. Lyons, he's your chief guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7696)|
| 2:08:22| He had to go in negotiation with the state for y'all to get that dog on property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7702)|
| 2:08:28| And when y'all got that property, and when you sit up there, sir, and said y'all going to give three bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7708)|
| 2:08:34| those three bids, y'all already had in the back of your mind what y'all wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7714)|
| 2:08:38| because you made a statement saying we want to lease a hundred-bed hotel, bed and bath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7718)|
| 2:08:45| See, but what y'all have done, y'all have underhanded this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| And that would really tee me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| You guys are supposed to be for the people, the government, by the people, and for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7731)|
| 2:08:57| Well, what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| Mr. Mayor, y'all have no idea what you're doing to this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7739)|
| 2:09:04| Yeah, you can build, I bet you give another tilth to the Sentinel building when they finish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| They're going to get a tilth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| Everybody's getting a doggone tilth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| If that building over there becomes a hotel, they don't deserve a tilth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| because what y'all are doing is underhanding what the citizens of Knoxville have already voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7757)|
| 2:09:22| Yeah, sure, you're not using tax money, but you're giving them the opportunity to build that hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| and you're saying we ain't going to charge you no taxes for building that hotel for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| For us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| Because the citizens don't want another hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| You guys are in, y'all pushing the issue to get another hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| Like I said, I see one on there, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7780)|
| 2:09:44| Would somebody like to give Mr. Montgomery another two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| Give me three more minutes, Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| I've been over your place, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7788)|
| 2:09:49| You're a locked-up shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| You're already over one, so he'll give you two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| Hey, Mr. Mayor, y'all going around here, what have my black kids got to do around here in this city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7795)|
| 2:10:02| Not nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7802)|
| 2:10:03| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7803)|
| 2:10:04| If you're going to put something on that street site, you need to put a discovery museum or something for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7804)|
| 2:10:12| Heck, kids don't want to go to that doggone Sunspear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7812)|
| 2:10:16| What they got to do at the Sunspear but look down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7816)|
| 2:10:19| Y'all have like, y'all done the kids or people in this city a big favor by opening that dumbass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| ready to say something, that doggone Sunspear, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| Your legacy is East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| So, see, I'm going to hound you for the next three years while you're in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7831)|
| 2:10:35| I'm going to get me a blog next week, and I'm going to talk about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7835)|
| 2:10:39| I'm going to talk about anybody on this council until y'all do right by the doggone people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7839)|
| 2:10:44| until you get your good friends, all these big-time developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7844)|
| 2:10:48| Y'all need to just turn all of Matanoia up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7848)|
| 2:10:51| I ran all over this city, sir, and you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7851)|
| 2:10:57| East Knoxville, for Matanoia to be a major corridor, Mr. Anderson, they done boxed us in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7857)|
| 2:11:06| They have boxed Matanoia in, and there is no life on Matanoia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| But you go to Fountain City or any other place in Knoxville, they striving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| They blooming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7875)|
| 2:11:16| And, you know, that's what pissed me off about you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7876)|
| 2:11:19| Y'all sitting with all these doggone photo ops, and you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| But to me, your legacy is East Knoxville because Victor has laid the foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7883)|
| 2:11:29| and you're not following through with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| You know, you're not following through, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| But lastly, who works for MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| They approved my project, Vice Mayor Brown, on Harrison and Louise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7898)|
| 2:11:42| but they sort of like going back-pedaling with that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| Y'all approved that money for Harrison and Louise, and y'all sent me a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| Now, my question is to you, for those sidewalks, because he already gave his new budget address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7910)|
| 2:11:59| Does that money still stand the pot for Harrison and Louise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7919)|
| 2:12:05| Answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7925)|

| 2:12:08| Answer mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7928)|
| 2:12:09| When that new budget come in, do we still get our doggone money for the sidewalks on Harrison and Louise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7929)|
| 2:12:17| Answer my question because other people are asking me, and I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7937)|
| 2:12:21| So when I go back to them, I don't come up here just for me all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7941)|
| 2:12:27| I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7947)|
| 2:12:28| That old man asked me tomorrow, Alonzo, what about our doggone sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| This was in the capital budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| No, it's not in the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| I want to know where is my money that y'all sent me the letter saying that money was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7958)|
| 2:12:43| I don't need going back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| You know the guy, the guy, what's the dude's name over there, engineering to handle sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7965)|
| 2:12:51| MPC doesn't have anything to do with sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7971)|
| 2:12:54| Not MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7974)|
| 2:12:55| It's engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7975)|

| 2:12:57| Who's engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| Mr. Mayor, I want my sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7980)|

| 2:13:10| They told me that I thought, and y'all approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7990)|
