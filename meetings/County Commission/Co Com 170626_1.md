| 2:51:36| You know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10296)|
| 2:51:38| It just looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10298)|
| 2:51:40| It wasn't handled right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10300)|
| 2:51:42| And there seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10302)|
| 2:51:44| To have been plenty of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10304)|
| 2:51:46| That this should have been caught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10306)|
| 2:51:48| Is what I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10308)|
| 2:51:50| I just have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| It's quite embarrassing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10312)|
| 2:51:54| To everyone involved in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10314)|
| 2:51:56| That it wasn't caught before it came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10316)|
| 2:51:58| This is the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10318)|
| 2:52:00| This is the process though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| I'm not blaming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10322)|
| 2:52:04| I'm just saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10324)|
| 2:52:06| I'm not putting any blame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10326)|
| 2:52:08| I'm just saying this whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10328)|
| 2:52:10| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10330)|
| 2:52:12| Let's say one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10332)|
| 2:52:14| About the timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10334)|
| 2:52:16| There has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10336)|
| 2:52:18| Any time lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10338)|
| 2:52:20| Nothing could be done by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10340)|
| 2:52:22| MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10342)|
| 2:52:24| After the letter was sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10344)|
| 2:52:26| So it doesn't matter whether we catch it today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10346)|
| 2:52:28| Or he caught it the next day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10348)|
| 2:52:30| There's nothing can happen until we get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10350)|
| 2:52:32| And I'm not putting the blame on anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10352)|
| 2:52:34| I'm just saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10358)|
| 2:52:40| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10360)|
| 2:52:42| Again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10362)|
| 2:52:44| Where I have a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10364)|
| 2:52:46| Is on Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10366)|
| 2:52:48| May the 5th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10368)|
| 2:52:50| You all entered in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10370)|
| 2:52:52| And put on the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10372)|
| 2:52:54| What the status was with this filing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10374)|
| 2:52:56| That you recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10376)|
| 2:52:58| That your team recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10378)|
| 2:53:00| Two dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10380)|
| 2:53:02| So any of the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10382)|
| 2:53:04| Who live on the single family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10384)|
| 2:53:06| Right in front of this property here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| All 14 or 15 of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10388)|
| 2:53:10| If they went to your website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10390)|
| 2:53:12| They would see that the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10392)|
| 2:53:14| Is recommending two homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10394)|
| 2:53:16| Per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10396)|
| 2:53:18| So from Friday afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10398)|
| 2:53:20| When that's posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10400)|
| 2:53:22| Until the meeting on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10402)|
| 2:53:24| At 1.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10404)|
| 2:53:26| The applicant never bothered to check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10406)|
| 2:53:28| To see what the staff recommendation was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10408)|
| 2:53:30| So now our paperwork says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10410)|
| 2:53:32| That if a citizen is looking up on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10412)|
| 2:53:34| And going oh good good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10414)|
| 2:53:36| It shows that the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10416)|
| 2:53:38| Is two dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10418)|
| 2:53:40| That's what the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10420)|
| 2:53:42| Is going to go by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10422)|
| 2:53:44| So we're now going to double the amount of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10424)|
| 2:53:46| Behind their houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10426)|
| 2:53:48| And I think that's wrong because you've left the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10428)|
| 2:53:50| Totally out of this equation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| If you moved to go for four dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10432)|
| 2:53:54| Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10434)|
| 2:53:56| Somebody wasn't watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10436)|
| 2:53:58| What was going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10438)|
| 2:54:02| I don't move for anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10442)|
| 2:54:04| I just recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10444)|
| 2:54:06| And there's only three of your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| That could have made a phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10448)|
| 2:54:10| To the applicant to make that statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10450)|
| 2:54:12| And we all know who those three are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10452)|
| 2:54:14| So who was the person that called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10454)|
| 2:54:16| And said that they didn't have a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| With the number of units for that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10458)|
| 2:54:20| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10460)|
| 2:54:22| I'll find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10462)|
| 2:54:24| Commissioner Brantley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10464)|
| 2:54:26| Well my remark is similar to what John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10466)|
| 2:54:28| Was saying is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10468)|
| 2:54:30| From the time that MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10470)|
| 2:54:32| Met on this at two per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10472)|
| 2:54:34| And now we're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| At four per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10476)|
| 2:54:38| And they don't have a voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10478)|
| 2:54:40| And I understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10480)|
| 2:54:42| And I appreciate Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10482)|
| 2:54:44| I think that's the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| Of this whole thing tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10486)|
| 2:54:48| It's not that you don't deserve the four units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10488)|
| 2:54:50| That's fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10490)|
| 2:54:52| But if we voted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10492)|
| 2:54:54| Those ten houses in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| Saying hey what happened here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| Because it was two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10498)|
| 2:55:00| And that's my only point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10500)|
| 2:55:02| Commissioner Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10502)|
| 2:55:04| Thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10504)|
| 2:55:06| So I'm just trying to figure out procedurally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10506)|
| 2:55:08| At this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10508)|
| 2:55:10| Because the MPC recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10510)|
| 2:55:12| Says one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10512)|
| 2:55:14| The policy violation is obviously clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10514)|
| 2:55:16| What do we do now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10516)|
| 2:55:18| There's no policy violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| There's been no violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| I think the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10522)|
| 2:55:24| In terms of the steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10524)|
| 2:55:26| That was written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10526)|
| 2:55:28| This is the way it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10528)|
| 2:55:30| Then I think we probably need to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10530)|
| 2:55:32| At the way it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| No this is the legislative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10534)|
| 2:55:36| I think the final decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10536)|
| 2:55:38| The applicant has the right to request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| Something that's different from the MPC recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10540)|
| 2:55:42| And that's what he's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10542)|
| 2:55:44| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10544)|
| 2:55:46| Where are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10546)|
| 2:55:48| Go ahead and answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| I'm trying to figure out procedurally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10550)|
| 2:55:52| Where are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10552)|
| 2:55:54| We're in discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10554)|
| 2:55:58| We do not have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| We do not get to a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| Until we finish the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| I get the whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| Of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10566)|
| 2:56:08| If you see it on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10568)|
| 2:56:10| You believe all parties are in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10570)|
| 2:56:12| The applicant wasn't there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10572)|
| 2:56:14| To object to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10574)|
| 2:56:16| So the neighbours might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| Did your office get any calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10578)|
| 2:56:20| From these people when it was put up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| At four units an acre request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10582)|
| 2:56:24| No calls, no emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10584)|
| 2:56:26| No contact at all from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10586)|
| 2:56:28| If the request is initiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10588)|
| 2:56:30| At four units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10590)|
| 2:56:32| Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10592)|
| 2:56:34| Did you hear from any of your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10594)|
| 2:56:36| When the sign was put up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10596)|
| 2:56:38| No sir I did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10598)|
| 2:56:40| Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10600)|
| 2:56:42| And I'll also add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| Director Green is absolutely correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10604)|
| 2:56:46| We are the ultimate power in these decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10606)|
| 2:56:48| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| We can change anything anytime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10612)|
| 2:56:54| As a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| It's never good to assume that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10616)|
| 2:56:58| Anything is going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| You have to show up if you are against something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10620)|
| 2:57:02| And follow it to the very end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| To make sure it winds up the way it was supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10624)|
| 2:57:08| Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10628)|
| 2:57:10| Before I make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10630)|
| 2:57:12| I want to say one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| I was on the MPC for over eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10634)|
| 2:57:16| And if one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10636)|

| 2:59:46| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10786)|
| 2:59:50| Just a quick comment. The CA to RA zone, you know, we talk about buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10790)|
| 2:59:56| You know, we've got single dwelling in the front, then we're going to have maybe double that to the CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10796)|
| 3:00:02| I don't see that, I didn't mention that, but I see that as a buffer. I think Mr. Campbell said it was a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10802)|
| 3:00:08| This is an actual what I think zoning should be, a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10808)|

| 3:01:33| Was this one no show last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10893)|

| 3:01:37| Both of these have been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10897)|
| 3:01:38| Well, this one's been deferred from May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10898)|
| 3:01:42| Did they no show or did they request a deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10902)|
| 3:01:45| I think they no show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10905)|
| 3:01:48| Don't we have a new policy of notify them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10908)|
| 3:01:50| No, we have a policy of two months, I believe it was, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10910)|
| 3:01:54| Okay, Mr. Wahlman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10914)|
| 3:01:57| We have adopted a new rule that governs this situation and it provides that matters will be deferred automatically once to the next agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10917)|
| 3:02:09| And they're deferred after that according to the Commission's wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10929)|
| 3:02:15| If the Commission doesn't wish to defer them any further than the one meeting, then they're deemed withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10935)|

| 3:02:30| Motion is properly before us to notify by certified letter this applicant Brandy Wine at Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10950)|
| 3:02:39| Seeing Commissioner Smith, you have a question about the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10959)|
| 3:02:42| About the procedure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10962)|
| 3:02:44| I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10964)|
| 3:02:46| Maybe I'm wrong about this, but I think per MPC rule, an applicant has the right to call in or show up and ask for one automatic postponement, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10966)|
| 3:02:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10978)|
| 3:02:59| And then I guess we need to keep track if they've done that and then they don't show up the second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10979)|
| 3:03:04| Now, in this case, did they show up or call in for a postponement last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10984)|
| 3:03:09| Not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| Okay, so in the future, if they ask for a postponement, they get it if they don't show up the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10991)|
| 3:03:18| Somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10998)|
| 3:03:19| That's what the law director just said our rule was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10999)|
| 3:03:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11002)|

| 3:05:46| There is an issue with access to the site that would be worked out during the plan review process, and I think that was what the engineer was working on last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11146)|

| 3:06:09| Now, this was planned commercial, and this was kind of what we were talking about in that new Chaud Road extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11169)|
| 3:06:16| Of course, there's four corners, Bakertown and then Lowe Betty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11176)|
| 3:06:19| So, am I on the right one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11181)|
| 3:06:22| It was planned commercial with a condition attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11182)|
| 3:06:26| Okay, so now we're going to plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11186)|
| 3:06:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11188)|
| 3:06:29| So, does the County still own a right-of-way through the middle of that property, and that's all been taken care of, access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11189)|
| 3:06:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11194)|

| 3:06:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11200)|

| 3:07:05| Commissioner Smith, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11225)|
| 3:07:09| You all at your budget hearings approved the extension of Chaud Road through this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11229)|
| 3:07:16| We have been through the concept plan and use on review for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11236)|
| 3:07:20| We did it at the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11240)|
| 3:07:24| One of the conditions is that we cannot plant any lot south of the new, or I guess is it southeast of the new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11244)|
| 3:07:33| Chaud Road until Lobetti Road is complete, which should be, according to Mr. Snowden, sometime in late summer or fall of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11253)|
| 3:07:47| They're prospecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11267)|
| 3:07:50| Although we have a concept plan and use on review approved, we will not be able to plant the southern lots until the road work is finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11270)|
| 3:08:00| Will both sides, north and south of this development, go to Lobetti instead of cutting into the new road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11280)|
| 3:08:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11286)|
| 3:08:07| There will be a right end and the concept plan approved right end on Chaud Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11287)|
| 3:08:22| Both directions, right ends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11302)|
| 3:08:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11303)|
| 3:08:24| And then all exits will be to Lobetti for lefts out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11304)|
| 3:08:28| Lobetti will be both in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11308)|
| 3:08:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11312)|
| 3:08:33| This is something that I know Engineering and Public Works are somewhat concerned about as Chaud Road is developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11313)|
| 3:08:42| getting too many curb cuts and making sure that we use access to these crossroads that are existing to try to limit the access points to this new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11322)|
| 3:08:52| Is that your understanding, Director Gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11332)|
| 3:08:54| Yes, sir, and the Department of Engineering and Public Works was very involved in the review of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11334)|
| 3:09:00| working with the engineer to develop the limited access they do have to Chaud Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11340)|
| 3:09:07| And I guess just for my own information, how much planned commercial did they have in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11347)|
| 3:09:12| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11352)|
| 3:09:13| This square was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11353)|
| 3:09:15| This went from Bakertown to Lobetti and the width of this zoning was all planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11355)|
| 3:09:22| The rest of it was planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11362)|
| 3:09:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11364)|
| 3:09:25| The one just to the left of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11365)|
| 3:09:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11368)|
| 3:09:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11369)|
| 3:09:30| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11370)|
| 3:09:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11372)|
| 3:09:33| I guess this is for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11373)|
| 3:09:37| All of these has got some type of attachment all the way around it, special regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11377)|
| 3:09:43| Do you know what those are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11383)|
| 3:09:45| We have to go back in our files and check them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11385)|
| 3:09:47| Each zoning, for example, there was one or two earlier tonight where there was a condition attached to the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11387)|
| 3:09:55| There was a place in our files, both our paper files and our digital files, so that we can access them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11395)|
| 3:10:02| But I don't know what they all are for all the properties that have conditions attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11402)|
| 3:10:07| Well, it's unusual to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| I've never seen it in eight, nine years of all these attachments on one, two, three, four, four different parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11409)|
| 3:10:17| So I just wondered if you knew what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11417)|
| 3:10:19| So I'll take your recommendation on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11419)|
| 3:10:23| The concept plan had about 15 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11423)|
| 3:10:28| Are there other questions of the presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11428)|
| 3:10:35| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11435)|
| 3:10:36| Motion to approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11436)|
| 3:10:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11438)|
| 3:10:41| Is there discussion now amongst commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11441)|
| 3:10:46| Seeing no discussion amongst commissioners, the motion is properly before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11446)|
| 3:10:52| to approve this rezoning per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11452)|
| 3:11:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11461)|
| 3:11:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11462)|
| 3:11:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11463)|
| 3:11:05| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11465)|
| 3:11:07| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11467)|
| 3:11:08| 4-J-17-RZ is a request of DJT Holdings, LLC for rezoning from May agriculture to PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11468)|
| 3:11:18| at a density up to 4 to 1 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11478)|
| 3:11:21| The property is located southeast side of Ball Road, northeast of Lobetti Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11481)|
| 3:11:28| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11488)|
| 3:11:33| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11493)|
| 3:11:37| DJT Holdings, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11497)|
| 3:11:45| If there is no objection, this will be moved to the heel of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11505)|
| 3:11:50| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11510)|
| 3:11:51| I'll make a motion that we send them a certified letter and show it's off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11511)|
| 3:11:57| This being a deferred from May item, motion is to send certified mail notification to attend the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11517)|
| 3:12:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11530)|
| 3:12:11| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11531)|
| 3:12:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11533)|
| 3:12:14| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11534)|
| 3:12:17| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11537)|
| 3:12:19| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11539)|
| 3:12:23| The next item in the zoning appeal is 4-A-17-OA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11543)|
| 3:12:29| Appeal by 10-TAC Scott Osborne of MPC's decision to deny proposed amendment to the ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11549)|
| 3:12:37| amending the Knox County Code Appendix A, zoning, Article 4, Section 4-97, Standards for the Approval of Indoor and Outdoor Paintball Ranges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11557)|
| 3:12:47| and Article 5, Section 5.22A, Agricultural Zone regarding indoor facilities as a use on review in the Agricultural District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11567)|
| 3:12:57| This amends Ordinance O-06-7-101 adopted August 28, 2006 and Ordinance O-12-9-102 adopted October 22, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11577)|
| 3:13:13| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11593)|
| 3:13:14| Mr. Law Director, I believe we need some clarification on where this particular zoning appeal may lead us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11594)|
| 3:13:25| So, on review, it's clear that this request is an amendment to the text of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11605)|
| 3:13:33| This commission in the county is required by charter to amend the text of the zoning ordinance by an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11613)|
| 3:13:40| No surprise that an ordinance will amend an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11620)|
| 3:13:44| Ordinances require two readings and they require upon first reading that the caption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11624)|
| 3:13:51| number one, that the caption be submitted to the commission several days before the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11631)|
| 3:13:58| and then that the commission have the full text of the ordinance at least 48 hours before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11638)|
| 3:14:05| There's a couple of issues with that because this item came to the commission as an appeal of a decision that MPC made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11645)|
| 3:14:15| It's not really an appeal, it's an amendment to the ordinance, a request for the amendment of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11655)|
| 3:14:21| Number one, the caption did not appear in your agenda as an amendment to an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11661)|
| 3:14:31| so you don't have that requirement in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11671)|
| 3:14:34| Number two, you don't have the full text of the proposed amendment or the proposed ordinance at least 48 hours before this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11674)|
| 3:14:42| So, long story short, if the commission desires to amend the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11682)|
| 3:14:47| the text of the ordinance by adopting what's been applied for here, it needs to go on first reading next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11687)|
| 3:14:55| There needs to be a caption, an appropriate caption that will appear in the agenda for your regular meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11695)|
| 3:15:03| as an ordinance on first reading and then you'll need the full text of that ordinance at least 48 hours before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11703)|
| 3:15:12| So, that's my recommendation. It's not appropriate to read this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11712)|
| 3:15:16| And as you look at the plain language English of the caption, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11716)|
| 3:15:23| Proposed Amendment to the Ordinance of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11723)|
| 3:15:32| And in order to amend, we have to have two readings of the ordinance and an appropriate notification to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11732)|
| 3:15:53| Commissioner Smith, I think you're first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11753)|
| 3:15:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Am I also understanding this correctly that the appropriate body is not us sitting as a zoning, but as commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11757)|
| 3:16:08| Well, when it appears on your agenda in the correct form, it will be part of a regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11768)|
| 3:16:14| I think that's six point one and a half dozen and another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11774)|
| 3:16:20| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11780)|
| 3:16:22| If I could, I'd like to talk to Mr. Green a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11782)|
| 3:16:27| Can you kind of give us a little briefing in layman's terms of what we have and then also kind of discuss the MPC of eight to seven to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11787)|
| 3:16:36| What went on there to, kind of what brought this to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11796)|
| 3:16:41| And then so we can have maybe a preliminary if that's okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11801)|
| 3:16:44| Yes, most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11804)|
| 3:16:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11805)|
| 3:16:47| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11807)|
| 3:16:49| The current zoning ordinance addresses paintball and paintball facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11809)|
| 3:16:54| This is an airsoft, it addresses to some extent airsoft, but not outdoor airsoft ranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11814)|
| 3:17:01| The applicant wanted to expand their current operation from indoor airsoft to outdoor airsoft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11821)|
| 3:17:08| That required an ordinance amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11828)|
| 3:17:11| The MPC staff worked with the applicant and his representatives to craft an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11831)|
| 3:17:16| actually to better define our ordinance both for paintball and airsoft to allow expansion to outdoor facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11836)|
| 3:17:25| setting certain standards for those uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11845)|
| 3:17:28| The property on which the current operation is located is zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11848)|
| 3:17:35| It's in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11855)|
| 3:17:37| Is it to the left of this 10-tac airsoft building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11857)|
| 3:17:40| Is that the green space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11860)|
| 3:17:41| That's the green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11861)|
| 3:17:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11862)|
| 3:17:43| And the growth policy plan, airsoft and paintball unlimited is permitted in the industrial zone and a couple other zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11863)|
| 3:17:53| The growth policy plan prohibits the rezoning of this property to industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11873)|
| 3:17:58| So we looked at an ordinance amendment to the agricultural district that would identify this use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11878)|
| 3:18:03| what standards is a use permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11883)|
| 3:18:06| working with the applicant to try to address what they wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11886)|
| 3:18:10| while ensuring that there were protections and standards for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11890)|
| 3:18:15| It went before the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11895)|
| 3:18:18| As you can tell, it was a closely divided vote, a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11898)|
| 3:18:21| The concern was that allowing this in the agricultural district would infringe on the agricultural district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11901)|
| 3:18:31| and the proposed purpose of the agricultural district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11911)|
| 3:18:35| The staff understands that there are some amendments to this that could be made that would address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11915)|
| 3:18:43| In addition, staff is working on a rural preservation zoning classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11923)|
| 3:18:47| that would better protect agricultural uses and open spaces in the county at the desire of the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11927)|
| 3:18:55| Okay, so the NPC staff is of the mind that airsoft is not appropriate in agriculture and they don't want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11935)|
| 3:19:05| That's the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11945)|
| 3:19:08| The staff took this recommendation, recommended change to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11948)|
| 3:19:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11954)|
| 3:19:15| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11955)|
| 3:19:18| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11958)|
| 3:19:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11961)|
| 3:19:22| Is the ordinance 4.97 in our literature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11962)|
| 3:19:25| Is that the one we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11965)|
| 3:19:29| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11969)|
| 3:19:30| It's a draft amendment to 4.97.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11970)|
| 3:19:35| If it's in your packet as Exhibit A, the bold font would be the revised language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11975)|
| 3:19:44| The standard font is the existing 4.97.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11984)|
| 3:19:48| I guess, Mr. Law Director, this is what we'll see next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11988)|
| 3:19:52| It's very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11992)|
| 3:19:55| Very similar, but you do not technically have the full language of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=11995)|
| 3:20:00| and you haven't had that for 48 hours before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12000)|
| 3:20:04| Yeah, we've got something to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12004)|
| 3:20:06| The NPC staff, I guess, recommends denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12006)|
| 3:20:11| The commission recommended denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12011)|
| 3:20:13| The commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12013)|
| 3:20:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12014)|
| 3:20:15| For what reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12015)|
| 3:20:16| Again, the discussion seemed to center on the impact that uses like this would have on agricultural district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12016)|
| 3:20:24| and potential preservation of agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12024)|
| 3:20:27| I think there's some amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12027)|
| 3:20:29| We could work with the applicant to make amendments to this to reduce that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12029)|
| 3:20:37| Well, in agricultural, I can have a demolition dump and an air strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12037)|
| 3:20:43| and a bunch of other stuff in there that needs to be taken out, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12043)|
| 3:20:47| That's why we're working on the rural preservation classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12047)|
| 3:20:50| I don't think my next door neighbor would like a demolition dump in my back yard or property range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12050)|
| 3:20:58| Mr. Seymour, are you following all this in agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12058)|
| 3:21:02| Well, Mr. Sanders and I talked just before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12062)|
| 3:21:07| The text of the amendment is in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12067)|
| 3:21:11| It's not in the ordinance form in that it does not say add the bowl to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12071)|
| 3:21:18| So I'm not going to quarrel with Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12078)|
| 3:21:20| I'm sorry I just found this out this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12080)|
| 3:21:24| The problem we have come up with is this property on Valero Road is, and I think I figured out the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12084)|
| 3:21:35| It's the old Camel Tent Manufacturing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12095)|
| 3:21:38| Probably built out there in 1944, 45 for the war effort, for World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12098)|
| 3:21:46| The county mapped its zoning or finally finished the zoning mapping I think sometime in the early to mid 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12106)|
| 3:21:57| This property is not visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12117)|
| 3:21:59| Unless you drive off Chapman Highway for half a mile or so, you wouldn't even know it was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12119)|
| 3:22:07| I suspect, and this is suspicion only, that when the county was doing the zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12127)|
| 3:22:14| it went out and delineated the commercial property that was visible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12134)|
| 3:22:18| which tended to be on the major arterial roads, Kingston Bike, Clinton Highway, and so forth, and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12138)|
| 3:22:27| And nobody went back and looked at this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12147)|
| 3:22:30| It has been converted to a large extent from Camel Manufacturing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12150)|
| 3:22:36| They built a new facility out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12156)|
| 3:22:39| There's a steel company out there in this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12159)|
| 3:22:41| There is a boat repair company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12161)|
| 3:22:47| There are several industrial uses on the property that is zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12167)|
| 3:22:52| And it has been causing consternation for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12172)|
| 3:22:56| Now, the problem is to actually zone the property industrial, which it should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12176)|
| 3:23:02| you cannot do it because of the urban growth boundary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12182)|
| 3:23:05| It is in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12185)|
| 3:23:09| And if somebody would contend if you all zone this property industrial, you're violating the urban growth boundary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12189)|
| 3:23:19| So, our client bought an airsoft facility out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12199)|
| 3:23:27| It was both indoors and outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12207)|
| 3:23:33| County codes issued a notice of violation, said it was not permitted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12213)|
| 3:23:39| And that was back in November of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12219)|
| 3:23:45| Since then, this was the only airsoft facility in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12225)|
| 3:23:51| It was very well used, very popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12231)|
| 3:23:54| They had tournaments that brought in people from out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12234)|
| 3:23:59| But our client has been trying to bring this property into full compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12239)|
| 3:24:07| To that end, he has asked, as Mr. Green said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12247)|
| 3:24:12| that airsoft be permitted in an agricultural zone as a use on review in a building where it had been operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12252)|
| 3:24:22| And I believe this building also has industrial uses in it also, but it's zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12262)|
| 3:24:29| So that is the thrust of the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12269)|
| 3:24:33| MPC staff prepared an amendment, which is in the form Mr. Kelly's memo has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12273)|
| 3:24:42| It went to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12282)|
| 3:24:44| There was concern that if this was permitted, that people would be building buildings on agricultural property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12284)|
| 3:24:52| for airsoft facilities or paintball facilities and taking up valuable agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12292)|
| 3:25:01| The intent of our client is to use an existing building that's probably been there, what, 70 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12301)|
| 3:25:09| something like that for an indoor airball facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12309)|
| 3:25:14| The industrial uses, I think, have been just considered a preexisting nonconforming use in these buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12314)|
| 3:25:23| and the property is zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12323)|
| 3:25:26| I believe that our zoning came in about 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12326)|
| 3:25:30| These buildings were there way before the 60s, like you say, the camels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12330)|
| 3:25:35| The TNTAC Airsoft, is that the O-Express packaging?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12335)|
| 3:25:38| Are they still doing boxes in there or did they finally move out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12338)|
| 3:25:41| I think they're doing boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12341)|
| 3:25:44| Come on up here and identify yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12344)|
| 3:25:47| I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12347)|
| 3:25:50| Salah Rabi, 12712 Highwick Circle, Knoxville, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12350)|
| 3:25:57| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12357)|
| 3:26:01| To answer your question, we occupy, in the indoor facility, there are actually three tenants in that existing warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12361)|
| 3:26:08| There's bullet boats, express packaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12368)|
| 3:26:10| They occupy the lower level and we're at the top level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12370)|
| 3:26:18| Between bullet boats and express packaging, we're talking about heavy machinery that these industries or businesses use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12378)|
| 3:26:28| What happened is we took over a business four years ago, which was an operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12388)|
| 3:26:34| It has all the checks and balances and everything was done according to what we were told from the previous owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12394)|
| 3:26:42| so I thought he was able to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12402)|
| 3:26:45| The thing is, and if I just may just add something to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12405)|
| 3:26:50| what we were trying to request is that there be a legislation for something to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12410)|
| 3:26:55| Airsoft is an industry, it's a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12415)|
| 3:26:57| It has to have a recognition in order for people to be able to obtain permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12417)|
| 3:27:02| In our situation, it is a special situation where there is an existing structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12422)|
| 3:27:07| We are not trying to build a steel structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12427)|
| 3:27:11| It's a warehouse that's, in fact, been around since 1896.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12431)|
| 3:27:14| A section of the warehouse was moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12434)|
| 3:27:17| It used to be an asylum and then they started building other sections and expanded the warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12437)|
| 3:27:22| and then the camel tents came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12442)|
| 3:27:23| There's actually great history in that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12443)|
| 3:27:27| So what we're saying is maybe it was an oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12447)|
| 3:27:31| This is an area that is zoned agriculture, but over 15 businesses in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12451)|
| 3:27:36| and maybe about 15 warehouses probably, are operating machinery, equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12456)|
| 3:27:41| They are actually taxed as industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12461)|
| 3:27:44| So technically, we are in an industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12464)|
| 3:27:46| Unfortunately, it's zoned agriculture, the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12466)|
| 3:27:50| What we're saying is we're not trying to destroy the farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12470)|
| 3:27:54| Actually, we're saying there are special situations that may merit a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12474)|
| 3:28:01| to consider it as a special situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12481)|
| 3:28:04| And that was what we were asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12484)|
| 3:28:07| But unfortunately, the vote came to where a denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12487)|
| 3:28:11| instead of a motion to approve it on the consent list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12491)|
| 3:28:15| Mr. Green, if this ordinance is approved, it's still going to be a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12495)|
| 3:28:19| That's correct, Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12499)|
| 3:28:20| And use on review is by MPC appellable to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12500)|
| 3:28:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12505)|
| 3:28:26| On that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12506)|
| 3:28:28| I'm for you 100%. I thought it should have passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12508)|
| 3:28:31| I know there's probably some technicalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12511)|
| 3:28:34| but I'm going to have to defer to the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12514)|
| 3:28:38| and I hate to say you may have to wait another couple of months on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12518)|
| 3:28:42| I would rather err on the side of my law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12522)|
| 3:28:45| We're okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12525)|
| 3:28:46| I mean, we want to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12526)|
| 3:28:47| That's the whole idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12527)|
| 3:28:48| And at the same time, we want to make sure we get back in business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12528)|
| 3:28:50| and get the airsoft community back to playing the only place in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12530)|
| 3:28:54| I've been in this building many, many times for my former job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12534)|
| 3:28:58| selling them parts to build the boxes and everything and the boats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12538)|
| 3:29:01| and there's nothing wrong with what you're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12541)|
| 3:29:04| Totally at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12544)|
| 3:29:05| So hopefully it gets done in the next two to three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12545)|
| 3:29:08| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12548)|
| 3:29:09| Thank you very much, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12549)|
| 3:29:10| Ms. Greenwood, I've still got two other commissioners in the first round,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12550)|
| 3:29:14| and you'll be the third next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12554)|
| 3:29:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12556)|
| 3:29:17| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12557)|
| 3:29:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12559)|
| 3:29:21| Very rarely do I feel any need to get on any kind of high horse here at county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12561)|
| 3:29:26| but this is just one of those cases where I feel like you've been done wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12566)|
| 3:29:30| When we've got a preexisting business that's been in operation for quite some time that you purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12570)|
| 3:29:35| then when you're going through the steps of trying to grow it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12575)|
| 3:29:38| and having actually been on site and walked the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12578)|
| 3:29:41| I'll admit there's a couple of junkyard dogs over there by that car repair place that scared me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12581)|
| 3:29:46| but that area that you're looking to put the field in, it looks like a brownfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12586)|
| 3:29:51| and it looks like it's about the only thing that you probably could do with that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12591)|
| 3:29:55| so it's probably highest and best use for that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12595)|
| 3:29:59| And after visiting it, I took the liberty to go to the satellite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12599)|
| 3:30:04| and send a picture out to my fellow commissioners just because seeing it on paper really doesn't do it justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12604)|
| 3:30:10| until you've gotten a feel for what this looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12610)|
| 3:30:13| It really does look, feel industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12613)|
| 3:30:16| Besides the fact you've got a car, I guess a super car garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12616)|
| 3:30:20| I'm not sure what they're doing over there, if they're customizing cars or building cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12620)|
| 3:30:24| but it very much feels industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12624)|
| 3:30:27| and I guess within the realm of where we're legally authorized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12627)|
| 3:30:32| we've got to do our best to try and make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12632)|
| 3:30:35| As it relates to agriculture, my family, my wife works in agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12635)|
| 3:30:39| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12639)|
| 3:30:40| And one thing I mentioned to Gerald is one way that we can look at this as it relates to use on reviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12640)|
| 3:30:48| if it's an agricultural conversion for a property like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12648)|
| 3:30:52| you can always put in something related to making sure it only applies to conversions of preexisting buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12652)|
| 3:30:58| as opposed to new construction, which would limit it to very much the cases like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12658)|
| 3:31:03| Also, as it relates to agriculture, things like this can be used as agricultural tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12663)|
| 3:31:10| though not necessarily this particular site because, frankly, it's industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12670)|
| 3:31:13| but in other areas of the state, it's more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12673)|
| 3:31:17| it falls almost in the line of something where a farmer could convert properties to use in agricultural tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12677)|
| 3:31:26| and often you do see sites that are used for airsoft also used for paint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12686)|
| 3:31:31| that are used for paint bar also used for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12691)|
| 3:31:33| and very commonly, it is a use of agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12693)|
| 3:31:38| So I think we can find some way to make this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12698)|
| 3:31:43| and I think you're commended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12703)|
| 3:31:45| It is a unique business, and it is, from what I can tell, the only business of this kind in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12705)|
| 3:31:49| and I don't know that our community could support more than one or two of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12709)|
| 3:31:54| so I'm not that much worried about a high growth in this particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12714)|
| 3:31:58| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12718)|
| 3:32:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12720)|
| 3:32:02| Let me ask you, you said this indoor-outdoor usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12722)|
| 3:32:05| Can you tell me what other parts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12725)|
| 3:32:08| Are you using some of that wooded area as an outdoor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12728)|
| 3:32:12| If you all want to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12732)|
| 3:32:16| That's basically, yeah, that would be the outdoor field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12736)|
| 3:32:19| Is that property picture, if you've got a picture, is that south toward the canvas shop through there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12739)|
| 3:32:29| I don't have the map in front of me, but yes, it is, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12749)|
| 3:32:33| And that was actually a vacant property that we just purchased in order to expand and develop the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12753)|
| 3:32:40| Whether it's airsoft or paintball, the industry, basically, you'll find that indoor and outdoor is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12760)|
| 3:32:48| whether it's paintball or airsoft, and it was a natural progression for us to expand into an outdoor field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12768)|
| 3:32:55| For a simple reason, it's the weather, so when it's cold, you want to play indoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12775)|
| 3:32:59| When it's hot, you want to be outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12779)|
| 3:33:02| And so yes, this property was rezoned two months ago, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12782)|
| 3:33:09| and approval went through for it to be agriculture in order for it to be in conformity with the actual code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12789)|
| 3:33:16| because you can have an outdoor paintball field on an agriculture zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12796)|
| 3:33:22| So that has already been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12802)|
| 3:33:25| The indoor component, though, happens to be already in an existing ordinance, which is the agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12805)|
| 3:33:32| That is actually being operated as industrial by many others, and so we were looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12812)|
| 3:33:38| well, you have a situation here, it's a special situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12818)|
| 3:33:41| and so that's why we were recommending or hoping to get a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12821)|
| 3:33:46| so that it takes us or our situation into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12826)|
| 3:33:50| not to ruin the agriculture or change anything over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12830)|
| 3:33:54| and I do understand that you can have steel structures on an agriculture or on a farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12834)|
| 3:34:00| but that's not really what we're looking at doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12840)|
| 3:34:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12843)|
| 3:34:04| I was just asking where that piece of property was at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12844)|
| 3:34:07| and one thing I like about Airsoft, unlike paintball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12847)|
| 3:34:11| Airsoft is less attrusive because you don't have any of the paint residue left as you're going out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12851)|
| 3:34:17| Precisely why we like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12857)|
| 3:34:18| And I know it's a big business, but how much of that area would you have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12858)|
| 3:34:24| like I said, that wooded area, you've bought the property and you would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12864)|
| 3:34:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12868)|
| 3:34:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12869)|
| 3:34:30| It seems like a use on review would be the best way of getting these kinds of new, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12870)|
| 3:34:38| Sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12878)|
| 3:34:39| Sport in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12879)|
| 3:34:40| It's a sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12880)|
| 3:34:41| In, and I've seen what it has done in Kentucky, and they are going crazy in Kentucky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12881)|
| 3:34:46| and spending tons of tourist dollars going up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12886)|
| 3:34:52| So anyway, as soon as we can get this done, how soon do we get this man in business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12892)|
| 3:34:57| And by what way and what means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12897)|
| 3:35:01| We've got to pass an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12901)|
| 3:35:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12903)|
| 3:35:04| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12904)|
| 3:35:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12905)|
| 3:35:06| Two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12906)|
| 3:35:07| Two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12907)|
| 3:35:08| So we're looking at two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12908)|
| 3:35:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12910)|
| 3:35:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12911)|
| 3:35:12| Ms. Greenwood, we have had one round of commission speaking, and I recognize you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12912)|
| 3:35:20| She signed for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12920)|
| 3:35:24| Carolyn Greenwood, 3224 Boomerang Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12924)|
| 3:35:28| I was at the NPC meeting and was the one that took it off the consent agenda to discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12928)|
| 3:35:34| because of my concern for agricultural land being valued properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12934)|
| 3:35:39| And what this comes down to really is it's been said that hard cases make bad law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12939)|
| 3:35:44| This is that kind of a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12944)|
| 3:35:46| You want this guy to go into business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12946)|
| 3:35:48| I've seen the property from the aerial pictures, and it makes all kinds of sense to let him go into business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12948)|
| 3:35:53| It's all there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12953)|
| 3:35:54| It's just a matter of getting the approvals right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12954)|
| 3:35:57| The problem is you don't want to make this a use on review if it's going to be a slippery slope for agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12957)|
| 3:36:06| What could happen with this is if you've got, and I know that people that have agricultural land want to be able to have business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12966)|
| 3:36:16| to help them keep that land, you know, that they need to be able to prosper enough from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12976)|
| 3:36:21| But if you have somebody that's got outdoor soccer fields on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12981)|
| 3:36:25| and now they want to have an indoor athletic facility, are you going to let them do that on agricultural land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12985)|
| 3:36:32| Well, maybe, but there's a lot of things like that that this resembles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12992)|
| 3:36:36| and it doesn't seem to make sense for agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=12996)|
| 3:36:40| I sent an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13000)|
| 3:36:41| If you want to see between now and next month or whenever you start talking about this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13001)|
| 3:36:45| there's an email that really explains this in a way that I won't now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13005)|
| 3:36:49| I won't take your time to do this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13009)|
| 3:36:51| But I explain why we have an agricultural zone, what the purposes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13011)|
| 3:36:56| I reiterate what it says in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13016)|
| 3:36:59| And that does include these kind of way out things like airports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13019)|
| 3:37:04| I mean, there's a lot of landfills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13024)|
| 3:37:06| There's a lot of funky stuff that could go on agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13026)|
| 3:37:09| But that's all in the ordinance, and it's explained why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13029)|
| 3:37:11| You know, some things take more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13031)|
| 3:37:13| You know, it's for safety, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13033)|
| 3:37:15| But this doesn't fall under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13035)|
| 3:37:17| So we have to be careful not to let our emotional want to let this guy go into business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13037)|
| 3:37:22| which I do, I have nothing against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13042)|
| 3:37:24| end up being an ordinance that opens the door to the wrong kind of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13044)|
| 3:37:29| in agricultural lands or agricultural zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13049)|
| 3:37:32| And one other thing that I thought was really interesting about this case was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13052)|
| 3:37:36| I guess maybe now I'm understanding what I was looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13056)|
| 3:37:38| When I brought this up on KGIS, it said employment center zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13058)|
| 3:37:43| But then when I asked one of the people that's here today about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13063)|
| 3:37:47| she said it's all agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13067)|
| 3:37:49| So they must have gotten a change from employment center to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13069)|
| 3:37:52| I don't know if that's, is that what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13072)|
| 3:37:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13074)|
| 3:37:55| What I'm wondering is, couldn't the whole thing be employment center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13075)|
| 3:37:58| You can put that in a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13078)|
| 3:38:00| I wonder if they didn't go the wrong way on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13080)|
| 3:38:02| If you made it all employment center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13082)|
| 3:38:04| that employment center includes industrial and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13084)|
| 3:38:08| It seems like it's much more conducive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13088)|
| 3:38:11| or it goes with this kind of an application better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13091)|
| 3:38:15| So I don't know if that's off the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13095)|
| 3:38:16| since they already went kind of the other way with it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13096)|
| 3:38:19| But it seems to me that the idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13099)|
| 3:38:21| I would say one of two options from my point of view would be optimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13101)|
| 3:38:24| One would be if you could put conditions on it like you were suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13104)|
| 3:38:27| that if there's an existing building, it could be used for something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13107)|
| 3:38:31| That makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13111)|
| 3:38:32| I don't see an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13112)|
| 3:38:34| Or the other would be, could you just sell this whole thing employment center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13114)|
| 3:38:38| And then that kind of gets you out of this whole thing of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13118)|
| 3:38:40| all these businesses operating on agricultural, in an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13120)|
| 3:38:44| Could you just make the whole thing an employment center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13124)|
| 3:38:46| And that even works for a lot of dual kind of facilities, indoor, outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13126)|
| 3:38:51| Because from what I've seen, employment center is frequently in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13131)|
| 3:38:54| adjacent to agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13134)|
| 3:38:57| So if somebody wanted to have a second paypal facility on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13137)|
| 3:39:00| or airsoft facility here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13140)|
| 3:39:02| they could even get maybe partly employment center, partly agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13142)|
| 3:39:07| Anyway, take a look at my email for more details on what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13147)|
| 3:39:10| But that's kind of what was happening at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13150)|
| 3:39:13| The other thing that people were concerned about was that this really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13153)|
| 3:39:17| a number of the NPC commissioners were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13157)|
| 3:39:20| this looks more like industrial than it does ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13160)|
| 3:39:23| You know, we don't mind these other kind of businesses on agricultural land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13163)|
| 3:39:30| if it looks like agriculture somehow, if it fits in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13170)|
| 3:39:34| And this just didn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13174)|
| 3:39:36| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13176)|
| 3:39:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13178)|
| 3:39:39| And I may be addressing, go ahead, you may address exactly what I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13179)|
| 3:39:44| Thank you, Ms. Greenwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13184)|
| 3:39:46| I just want to mention a technicality that I think we're overlooking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13186)|
| 3:39:52| The code as it is right now, it allows for people on agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13192)|
| 3:39:59| But then if you want to have an indoor, it has to be industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13199)|
| 3:40:02| But the industry norm, or where the progress is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13202)|
| 3:40:05| is to have both indoor and outdoor on the same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13205)|
| 3:40:09| So there is a technicality problem here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13209)|
| 3:40:12| because how do you actually have two zones for one property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13212)|
| 3:40:16| So the legislation in itself needs to be reconsidered to allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13216)|
| 3:40:20| whether it's actually taking on the recommendation to put it all under EC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13220)|
| 3:40:25| or whatever the appropriate ordinance would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13225)|
| 3:40:28| it actually has to be one ordinance for both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13228)|
| 3:40:31| because that's where the industry is heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13231)|
| 3:40:34| Everybody has, and for the reasons that I mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13234)|
| 3:40:37| you're going to have indoor and outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13237)|
| 3:40:38| So technically we need to be looking at the entire legislation and how to reword it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13238)|
| 3:40:44| So I just wanted to add that, and I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13244)|
| 3:40:47| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13247)|
| 3:40:48| Yeah, that's exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13248)|
| 3:40:49| That's exactly what we said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13249)|
| 3:40:52| Mine is a little bit less about this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13252)|
| 3:40:56| and more in lines with the urban growth plan that we have heard for the last six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13256)|
| 3:41:02| that has begun to burden our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13262)|
| 3:41:05| And so I would like to ask the Chairman or the Law Director to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13265)|
| 3:41:12| I know we have to get an AG opinion from a legislator representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13272)|
| 3:41:16| if you would ask Lieutenant Governor McNally or one of the representatives, Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13276)|
| 3:41:21| or somebody to ask the State Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13281)|
| 3:41:25| if the urban growth plan still applies due to the fact that it has not been updated or reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13285)|
| 3:41:33| and if Knox County, being a second question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13293)|
| 3:41:39| if Knox County is a charter form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13299)|
| 3:41:43| are we bound by that urban growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13303)|
| 3:41:46| So two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13306)|
| 3:41:48| One, does it still apply even though it has not been reviewed by anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13308)|
| 3:41:53| And two, if it does apply, is Knox County exempt from the urban growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13313)|
| 3:41:58| because of our charter form of government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13318)|
| 3:42:00| We need that question answered opinion-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13320)|
| 3:42:02| Commissioner Anders, valid questions, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13322)|
| 3:42:05| Both questions are valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13325)|
| 3:42:07| And you and I, as laymen, need legal advice, and the Law Director will provide that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13327)|
| 3:42:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13334)|
| 3:42:15| I would just ask that we ask one of our legislators to make that recommendation to the AG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13335)|
| 3:42:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13339)|
| 3:42:20| Commissioner Brantley, you've been standing there on one foot with your question for about a half hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13340)|
| 3:42:26| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13346)|
| 3:42:28| Or your comment. You may also comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13348)|
| 3:42:30| Actually, I was just trying to relieve my back a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13350)|
| 3:42:33| It would seem to me that if this property is zoned industrial, it's solved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13353)|
| 3:42:39| and we can move on to the statewide issues some other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13359)|
| 3:42:44| The real estate currently is zoned AG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13364)|
| 3:42:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13369)|
| 3:42:50| And if we revise our ordinances to reflect that this is an allowable use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13370)|
| 3:42:58| then we may have answered this one particular individual question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13378)|
| 3:43:02| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13382)|
| 3:43:03| And because of the urban growth plan, we cannot rezone this property industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13383)|
| 3:43:10| Well, I wonder if Keene Machine and Welding or Jeffrey's Woodworks or Bullet Boats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13390)|
| 3:43:15| and Interstate Steel Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13395)|
| 3:43:18| This is a paradox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13398)|
| 3:43:19| We're not fighting that battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13399)|
| 3:43:21| I understand, but I understand why they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13401)|
| 3:43:24| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13404)|
| 3:43:25| We're not fighting that battle tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13405)|
| 3:43:27| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13407)|
| 3:43:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13408)|
| 3:43:29| The law department can correct me on this, but John and I said on the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13409)|
| 3:43:34| we were told, and Mr. Green will probably agree, our codes, Mr. Seymour, our codes need to be redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13414)|
| 3:43:42| Agricultural is not agricultural anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13422)|
| 3:43:45| Agricultural needs to be defined like a rural home, one acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13425)|
| 3:43:50| I was told, correct me if I'm wrong, that about in 1963, 65, they come up with the NPC, the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13430)|
| 3:43:59| Three members, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13439)|
| 3:44:01| We'll take my area, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13441)|
| 3:44:03| Merrill Park was the only major road, maybe beside Alcoa Highway, probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13443)|
| 3:44:09| Merrill Park, they took Merrill Park and the railroad that was beside it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13449)|
| 3:44:13| If you lived on Merrill Park, you were zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13453)|
| 3:44:17| If your lot was outside of that, you were zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13457)|
| 3:44:20| If you're zoned by the railroad, 300 feet left, 300 feet right, it's commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13460)|
| 3:44:26| That's the way they done it back in the 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13466)|
| 3:44:29| This is not 1960s anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13469)|
| 3:44:32| Our codes are outdated and we're suffering for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13472)|
| 3:44:35| but that's some of the reasons that you will see these today is that in 1965,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13475)|
| 3:44:43| they probably thought that every part of the railroad would be commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13483)|
| 3:44:47| That's not true anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13487)|
| 3:44:49| Industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13489)|
| 3:44:50| Or industrial, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13490)|
| 3:44:51| Industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13491)|
| 3:44:53| But that's not a part of the issue that we're discussing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13493)|
| 3:44:57| We're here to discuss the history of zoning and its resulting in we have to have an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13497)|
| 3:45:03| That's the history behind and why we are having this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13503)|
| 3:45:08| Other discussion of the issue that's facing us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13508)|
| 3:45:15| Mr. Law Director, are you comfortable in dealing with bringing us ordinance revisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13515)|
| 3:45:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13525)|
| 3:45:33| Commissioner Busler, you have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13533)|
| 3:45:35| I sat on the MPC and we went for three years making this urban growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13535)|
| 3:45:43| and one of the things we said in there was every three years you revisit it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13543)|
| 3:45:47| so we wouldn't get to this place we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13547)|
| 3:45:50| Now, does not following those instructions from the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13550)|
| 3:45:53| does that make that because we didn't follow the three year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13553)|
| 3:45:57| that we still have to really abide by something that we never followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13557)|
| 3:46:02| and keep us inside this jail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13562)|
| 3:46:06| What do we do to get outside that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13566)|
| 3:46:09| Madam Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13569)|
| 3:46:12| Madam Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13572)|
| 3:46:14| Madam Clerk, revisiting those items which we've moved to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13574)|
| 3:46:20| How do we get out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13580)|
| 3:46:23| We can't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13583)|
| 3:46:27| Don't we need a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13587)|
| 3:46:29| You need a motion or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13589)|
| 3:46:31| We can't just close this out like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13591)|
| 3:46:34| A motion to bring back an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13594)|
| 3:46:37| We have a right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13597)|
| 3:46:48| What has transpired on this zoning appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13608)|
| 3:46:52| is to direct the law department to help us correct our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13612)|
| 3:46:59| The items that we've moved to the end of the agenda, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13619)|
| 3:47:04| They're all listed on page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13624)|
| 3:47:06| 5-D-17-SP, Thomas Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13626)|
| 3:47:11| 5-D-17-RZ, Thomas Brooks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13631)|
| 3:47:16| That one's for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13636)|
| 3:47:17| The first one was for the Southwest County plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13637)|
| 3:47:19| Okay, pausing for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13639)|
| 3:47:22| Our action on those two items, is there a motion to move them to next month's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13642)|
| 3:47:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13648)|
| 3:47:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13651)|
| 3:47:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13652)|
| 3:47:33| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13653)|
| 3:47:35| Those two items are moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13655)|
| 3:47:36| Madam Clerk, the next that was moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13656)|
| 3:47:39| 5-I-17-RZ, request of Rick Wilkinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13659)|
| 3:47:46| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13666)|
| 3:47:48| Rick Wilkinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13668)|
| 3:47:53| Not seeing the applicant, do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13673)|
| 3:47:56| Move to the next zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13676)|
| 3:48:00| Motion is properly before us to move Rick Wilkinson to the next meeting of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13680)|
| 3:48:06| Madam Clerk, we have two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13686)|
| 3:48:11| We have these items with the certified letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13691)|
| 3:48:15| Where is the certified letter coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13695)|
| 3:48:20| I believe it would be the Chair of Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13700)|
| 3:48:23| Well, I don't care to send it, but it would be the Chair of Commission to notify them because it's our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13703)|
| 3:48:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13707)|
| 3:48:29| Director of Commission Office, would you prepare letters for me to address to these individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13709)|
| 3:48:39| certified mail that they must attend the next meeting of County Commission's zoning to consider their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13719)|
| 3:48:47| Else they will be considered withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13727)|
| 3:48:50| Mr. Law Director, am I correct in stating it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13730)|
| 3:48:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13734)|
| 3:48:55| I will make sure the law department sees a copy of my letter to make sure it is in conformity with what we need to do to notify these particular applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13735)|
| 3:49:07| Are there announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13747)|
| 3:49:11| No other items being on our agenda of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13751)|
| 3:49:17| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=13757)|
