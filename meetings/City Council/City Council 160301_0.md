| 0:02:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| For the mayor's report, first of all, we are joined tonight by some Boy Scouts, so we want to recognize, if you please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=128)|
| 0:02:15| We have Boy Scout Troop 448 from Trinity United Methodist Church, which is off Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=135)|
| 0:02:22| And also we have Scout Ben Beaver from Troop 146.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| So we appreciate you all being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=147)|
| 0:02:36| Also, I want to remind everybody, you've got 57 minutes left to vote, if you haven't already voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=156)|
| 0:02:42| in the presidential primary and our county primaries and school board elections that are being held today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| Polls close at 8 o'clock, so I encourage you to go on out and vote if you haven't already done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| On a more serious note, I do want to convey my, and I think I speak for all of council, sadness at the tragic passing of Sam Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=173)|
| 0:03:03| He and his family have made huge contributions to preserving and celebrating East Tennessee culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| He showed us that you can be down home and high class all at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| Blackberry Farm is not just a local and regional treasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| It is revered across the country and even across the globe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| In the New York Times obituary that ran Sunday, the paper called it a national destination for fine dining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| and a leader in the farm-to-table culinary movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| Much of that is thanks to Sam's commitment to quality and hospitality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| His legacy certainly will live on, including in many Knoxville restaurants that have been launched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| by chefs who worked at Blackberry Farm and learned their craft from Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| I know all of our thoughts and prayers are with his family as they cope with this truly devastating loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=225)|
| 0:03:55| This Friday morning is the Pancake Fest at the John T. O'Connor Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| I'd like to invite everyone to join me and Mayor Burchett, and I'm sure council members here will be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| and other elected officials at the Pancake Fest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| This is the 24th annual festival with the proceeds going to support programs at the O'Connor Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| It will run from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the center at 611 Winona Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| A $5 donation gets you pancakes, sausage, orange juice, and coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| There will even be gluten-free pancakes provided by UT Medical Center's Healthy Living Kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| So again, that is this Friday, March 4th, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the O'Connor Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| They always have great music as well, so come on out and join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| So the next day, Saturday, March 5th, is the Neighborhood Awards and Networking Luncheon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| which is organized by our Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| That will be from 10 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. at the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| We look forward to this being a well-attended event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| Online registration is closed, and we have more than 450 people who have signed up to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=299)|
| 0:05:06| If you didn't get a chance to sign up, I'm afraid that we are full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| We are fully booked, so hopefully you'll be able to make it next year to our conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| This will be a great opportunity for local neighborhood representatives to meet each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| and to interact with city officials and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| It's also a chance for us to recognize some of the good work being done in our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| with the Diana Kahn Neighbor of the Year Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| That's kind of the highlight, to recognize the great work that's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| So I do look forward to seeing everybody there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| That's the end of my report. Any reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| Yes, Mayor, I have a statement I would like to read concerning the Magnolia streetscapes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| since there's been so much discussion on that recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| First of all, let me say as a native Knoxvillean and East Knoxville resident, born and raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=353)|
| 0:06:01| I have endured segregation and urban renewal in this city that is home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| The urban renewal of the 50s and 60s is not the same as this particular plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=367)|
| 0:06:14| I have myself marched and protested here and in other cities on many causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| However, this particular plan I do not feel would be a bad plan but will be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=381)|
| 0:06:29| So I would like to offer my support for the Magnolia streetscapes plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| Many people that I have spoken to or contacted are not in opposition to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| I have been present at neighborhood and community meetings where the plan has been presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| and heard little or no opposition to the plan from various groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=407)|
| 0:06:54| Most are residents or business owners of the area who look forward to improvements in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=414)|
| 0:07:02| The plan would upgrade and beautify the area which hopefully will lead to private investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| and economic development and jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| Investment opportunities by minorities and others would help to revitalize this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| and restore Magnolia and that part of East Knoxville to its former glory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| along with the redevelopment of Walter P. Teller Homes and other projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| such as the Williams Creek Greenway, Botanical Gardens, improvements at Chilhowee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=450)|
| 0:07:37| and the Zoo Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| While I do respect the right of citizens to oppose any plan that spends taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=459)|
| 0:07:47| as the 6th District Representative, I plan to listen to all of the people in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| and take into account what is good for the residents, both short-term and long-term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| in regards to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| It is my desire that we as a community can and will work together for future improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=483)|
| 0:08:12| on other projects as we go forward as a city of progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| Thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| And in the interest of time, that concludes my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| I just want to join with Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| This thing's been almost a decade in gestation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| and I think the good thing that we should do as community members is make arrangements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| to have meetings with city staff to work out ideas that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| if you have concerns that you think were not addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| and to get at the core issue that you're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| Protests for the sake of protests don't bring solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| and I hope that everyone will seize the opportunity, if they have ideas, to present them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| and we'll all learn from them if something can be accommodated to make it work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| So I applaud what you said, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Any other reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| We'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=560)|

| 0:11:44| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Okay, so we have some people here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| And, Councilman Dallavopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Yeah, I just wanted to mention, I received notification, maybe others did too, that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| Murphy, who's, I guess, the applicant or the proponent of this, had been out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| country and was flying back, but he's not going to get from Chattanooga to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| He urged everyone to read the materials that he submitted, and that will be their position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| I don't think he'll be here to speak or have a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| Right, but we can, so he wants us to rely on what's already been presented, and he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| had quite a few emails and all and conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| So, now for the respondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| Do we have, did we have people sign up or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| Mr. Seymour, are you the only one to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| I'm sorry, I've been in a mediation all afternoon, just got out of it, and I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| get a chance to sign up to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| Okay, you may go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| As you know, you have up to five minutes to speak, and I'm going to set my timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| State your name and address for the record, sir, please, we know you well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| Mayor and members of council, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr., my office is at 550 West Main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| I am here on behalf of the original applicant for the variance and the opponent of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| I submitted a letter with a diagram today involving this property, and in case you didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=790)|
| 0:13:19| get it, I'm submitting here with copies of the diagram showing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=799)|
| 0:13:32| It is located, it's a block in the city of Knoxville, bounded on the north by Emerald| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| Avenue, on the west by Elm Street, on the south by Oldham, and generally to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=819)|
| 0:13:47| by the exit ramp from I-275 going south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| The purpose of the applicant is to build a dollar general store at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=833)|
| 0:14:00| The property is zoned C3 under the city of Knoxville zoning ordinance, which requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=840)|
| 0:14:08| a 25-foot front yard setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| Because this lot is bounded by four public right-of-ways, it has four front yards, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| it has to set back 25 yard feet from every public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=859)|
| 0:14:29| The applicant is asking for a very minor variance, which is shaded on, I'll call it Exhibit 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| which has been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| The applicant has tried to reconfigure the store on the lot, but could not do so and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| allow tractor-trailer onto the property for delivery of goods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=885)|
| 0:14:53| This is a very minimal variance, and the Knoxville zoning ordinance suggests that a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=893)|
| 0:15:04| that is in the public interest, in the spirit of the ordinance, and one that will promote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=904)|
| 0:15:13| the public interest should be granted, provided the applicant has asked for the minimum he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=913)|
| 0:15:21| can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| In this case, the minimum is less than 200 square foot encroachment there on the setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| So we feel that we meet all the requirements of the city of Knoxville zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| Yes, there were a number of lots on this property that were combined into one lot, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| was because there were five or six separate lots there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| You cannot make this property any bigger than it is because it is bounded on four sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| by a public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| One issue I do want to address is Mr. Murphy's standing to bring this appeal to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=956)|
| 0:16:05| council, and I have set forth the reasons in my letter, but generally, as far as municipalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=965)|
| 0:16:14| counties, and states go, anybody who is in the same position as any other citizen of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=974)|
| 0:16:22| the municipality, county, or state has no right to bring an appeal or a lawsuit challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=982)|
| 0:16:31| the action of a municipal body unless he has suffered some peculiar injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| I can't challenge your budget as a citizen because I'm like every other citizen of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=999)|
| 0:16:48| city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| I will live with what you all do on the budget, the other resolutions, and so forth, the tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| rate, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| A next-door neighbor who might object to this would have standing potentially to bring this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| appeal, but the general public does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| Mr. Murphy lives over eight miles from the location on Elm Street at Oldham Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1027)|
| 0:17:15| I think probably a number of us have been to his home before and know where it is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| Murphy Road and Washington Pike out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| So for those reasons, we initially say he does not have standing to bring this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| And second, the variance granted was the minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| It is completely in accord with the zoning ordinance of the city of Knoxville, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| I have cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| The ordinance permits variances where special circumstances or conditions, in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1063)|
| 0:17:52| four front yards exist, which limit the siting of property or a building on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1072)|
| 0:18:01| And that the granting of the variance is not contrary to the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| Time is up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Do you want to wrap it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| I'll rely on the last paragraph that it's not contrary to the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| The failure to grant it will result in an unnecessary hardship and will not violate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| the spirit of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| This is a commercial enterprise permitted in the C3 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| Well, as Arthur had stated, some of what I'm about to say, just for the record, but I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| reviewed it and looked at the information submitted and listened to those who spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| There may be an issue that Mr. Murphy lives too far from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| Looking at the Article 7, Section 2, I feel that a variance is warranted to allow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| applicant to proceed with this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| I believe that a lot that has four front yards is unique and is a special circumstance or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| condition because the property is deficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| I think this is a good location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| It's directly adjacent to 275 and other commercial properties for this business and they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| to build there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| It won't be contrary to the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| I think the variance requested is a minimum adjustment for the reasonable use of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| and it will allow for better truck delivery, traffic to location, benefiting traffic flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| in the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| The spirit of the ordinance will be observed by granting the variance and I do not support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| I don't support the appeal either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Mr. Kampen, you took many of my thoughts and so did Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| Yes, finally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| I just think that VZA reviewed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| They approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| This is an area where there is a need for a good store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| The Dollar Generals have been generally very responsive in the neighborhoods where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Also, I'm concerned that Mr. Murphy's standing is an issue that is troublesome for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| So, I will be denying this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| It seems to me that this whole appeal raises two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| Council there had told us about the standing question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| Is this sufficiently concrete by someone directly impacted that questions whether Mr. Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1216)|
| 0:20:24| is the right person to bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| The other question, though, is troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| And that is, even though this is a minor piece of property that we're talking about in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| of size, you know, the variance law really says that you can't create the problem with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| your design or building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| It has to be something uniquely kind of restrictive about the piece of property itself, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| it be topography, the siting, or something that causes a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| And the record shows, at least the part that I was able to see that's attached to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| appeal, is that they proposed two alternative standard designs and no one sat down with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1260)|
| 0:21:08| their architect and said, how can we slightly reshape the building or something to not run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| afoul of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Now, I agree that the kind of encroachment or whatever you want to call it on that setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| is pretty minor here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| And I don't think anyone's going to be put out by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| But he cites a case in there, McClurkin v. Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| I didn't have access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| But the thrust of it, and maybe one of these lawyers has read it, the thrust of it is basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| that it has to be a defect inherent in the land and not something that you create by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| the building you want to put on it or by the dollar cost of making adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1300)|
| 0:21:48| So it raises a question about are we using variances properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| And I kind of wish the Board of Zoning Appeals had sat up a little taller and talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| They didn't inquire into alternate designs and they didn't inquire into whether this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| was appropriate in light of the fact that it wasn't a particular defect in the land as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| to their proposed use of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| So I'm troubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| And maybe the answer is if there's no standing we never get to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| But it is a serious question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| And we have to be mindful that this is a very limited thing we have, variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| And this one doesn't seem to quite fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| I don't know if our counsel has anything to say about McClurkin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| But he cites that case and the idea that it can't be an owner-created hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| It must be a land-based one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| No, honestly, I have not reviewed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| No one requested that I take a look at that before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| But as you know from your decades of practice, cases turn on particular factual circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| where even though you have a precedence, there might be some distinguishing factors in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| where a court in the future may decide differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| I spoke to Mr. Kelly at MPC before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| I didn't realize that this had been a number of unimproved residential lots before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| And those lots, I think Mr. Kelly said they were 50 by 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| So those would have been old lots of records in order to build on those lots as they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| Sure, it would have taken variances for front yard setbacks and side yard setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| So this particular property owner combined everything, but you still have the setback issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| Probably when this neighborhood was platted out, I-275 wasn't coming through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| So there was a change in the land use in the immediate vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| It's ultimately up to this council and to a court if necessary in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| to determine if the requested variance was or was not properly granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1433)|
| 0:24:00| Councilman Grape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Vice Mayor Grape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| This is a little strange, but I'm sort of troubled the same way Mr. Dellavopi is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| I think this is maybe one of the first that we're on the same issue, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| As an architect, you can draw those lines different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Well, I can draw them straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Mr. Swanson, do you have anything to add in terms of what that particular case was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| in terms of what they were saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| I mean, is the process that they went through, was it okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| I don't have a problem with the project itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| but I am concerned about what they were bringing up about the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| and I'd like to hear from you and then maybe Mr. Kelly also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| I have read the McClurkin case, and the McClurkin case stands for the proposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| that you can't create your own hardship in order to be entitled to a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| You have to have a hardship that is in some way related to the peculiar topography of the land in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| And in the McClurkin case, it was a case where the court found there was just nothing at all unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| about that particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| The only hardship associated that required the variance was a hardship that was created by the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| and the owner's particular use of that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| and that there were other appropriate ways that it could be used that had not been considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1511)|
| 0:25:20| You have to look at the facts of each case, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| to determine whether or not you have factual circumstances that may be somewhat unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| Like in this case, you have a piece of land that has four front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| You have a piece of land that is bordering an interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| So there may be some issues related to topography to this particular parcel of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| that may not have been unique to the parcel of property that was discussed in the McClurkin case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| So that's really up to you all to decide whether the facts of the case would justify allowing a variance or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1546)|
| 0:25:54| whether a hardship is there and it's a hardship that's only created by the person who is seeking the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1554)|
| 0:26:02| That's really a judgment call for you all to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| and I think in this case you can make whatever judgment you believe to be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| because there are some arguments to be made that there are some unique factors to this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| as opposed to the court's conclusion in McClurkin that there just were no unique factors to that particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| I would also like to address the standing issue that's been raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| and I always admire Mr. Seymour when he makes these great legal arguments because he's such a good lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| but that argument really is an argument with regard to standing with regard to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| When he gets to court, he may make that argument, but with regard to standing in this particular forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| where the appeal comes to city council from the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| our code very clearly says any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals has standing in this forum to bring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1612)|
| 0:27:00| Now, whether that person also has standing then later on to deal with the issue in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| may be a different issue altogether from the court's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| but from city council's perspective as the appellant board hearing this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| our code very clearly grants standing to any person aggrieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| So I don't really think that's a defense that has merit in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| but the rest of it is really up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| How about Mr. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| Council members, Mayor Dan Kelly, MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| the zoning ordinance talks about two things in regard to granting grantees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| and the first is probably just as important as the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| It talks about whether it's practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1669)|
| 0:27:56| The practical difficulty or special circumstance that has been discussed earlier is the four front yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| and the four front yard was the issue that may have been created 60 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| but it was created by an action of the government when they created I-275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| So there may be an issue there with the right-of-way fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| The right-of-way along I-275 is considered a front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| However, they do not have access, cannot access I-275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| So you may want to look at that as a practical difficulty or special circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| and may have a basis for approving this variance request and overturning the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1716)|
| 0:28:46| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Well, I've had the opportunity to visit the site and to meet with the developer on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| and there's no question that the hardship is that it fronts four properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| It fronts four streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| It's very unusual, and that is certainly the hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| I think the practical difficulty is that they have presented me a preliminary site plan with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1747)|
| 0:29:14| and without the variance, and without the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| the difficulty is getting the tractor-trailers back to the loading dock that they proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| With this slight variance, it allows the tractor-trailers to come in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| and not remove any parking and be able to navigate around potential cars in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| Without that, without the variance, the very slight variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| then their difficulty of getting the tractor-trailer into the loading dock becomes a lot greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| and they put at risk either cars in the parking lot, and then they have to work around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| So I think it's a clear case that it – I mean, I'm not one to rubber-stamp variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| as I've voted against some in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| But having seen the site, having met with the developer, having looked at the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| there's no question that the hardship is the site, and it's not something they've created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| So I do not support the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| and I feel very strongly that it has met the criteria that's been presented by Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| I need a motion to approve or a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| I motion we deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Okay, we have a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| There was already a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| My motion was not seconded, and I want to withdraw it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| Okay, so we have a motion to deny, and did we get a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| Yes, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| The motion to deny passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1844)|
| 0:30:51| 11A is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an amendment to an agreement with Positively Living, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1851)|
| 0:30:58| to provide an additional $90,000 in community development block grant funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| to support the rehabilitation of its existing building to add five additional units of permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1863)|
| 0:31:10| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| I want to call on Becky Wade to address, just so that we're clear on the CDB funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| and how we get those and what they're intended for, and just to let her speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Thank you, Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| This is a request to add funds to an existing contract that City Council approved in September of 2014| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1895)|
| 0:31:44| to add five additional units of permanent supportive housing at Positively Living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| They currently operate 24 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| They are on site, and this will be five more units within the same building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| The funding comes from HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| It's our community development block grant funds that the city gets annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| We describe those projects and present that to you in our annual action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| and those have to meet certain priorities that are spelled out in our consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| Affordable housing is one of the things that we have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| There is a need for it, and so this helps to meet that priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| Have we used other CBG grant funds for Positively Living or for the other 24 units that are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Councilman Delevaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Becky, before you leave, you're really close to the mic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| Just fill us in on what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| I guess it was estimated a year ago or maybe two years ago, a year and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| at $100,000, and it came in at $220,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| That's a giant leap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| What happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| It was estimated by the East Tennessee Community Design Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| who helped do the conceptual designs for the units, rough estimate at just like $135,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1976)|
| 0:33:04| When they put it out to bid, the low bid was over $220,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| Positively Living sought grant funding from the Tennessee Housing Development Agency to fill in the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1990)|
| 0:33:18| They came very close to getting that award, but they did not make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| We are providing these funds to help get this project started and finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| and they will provide the extra $35,000 from a line of credit that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| Okay, but the early estimate was kind of a hip shot, it sounds like, because it missed it by a country mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| You don't really know what it's going to cost until you put it out to bid, and that was the low bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a quit claim deed to Iqbal Bimani| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| for one parcel of property located at 320 South Castle Street, parcel ID number 082-EP-033,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2044)|
| 0:34:12| within the limits of the city of Knoxville, pursuant to the homemaker's program for a contract sales price of $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with A. Morton Thomas and Associates, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| in an amount not to exceed $163,650 to provide a preliminary engineering study evaluating bicycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| and pedestrian connection options between the Fort Sanders neighborhood and Tyson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Councilman Della Hopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Yeah, I see Jim Hagerman is just sitting there waiting, dying to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| This is $163,000 for preliminary engineering for, I guess, a short stretch, I guess, with big problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| since you're crossing a railroad and they don't usually love people crossing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| and so you have to go over them or under them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| Is there a reason why we can't do this in-house or you need specialty engineers to kind of figure out how to solve the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2108)|
| 0:35:16| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Yeah, we need specialty engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| We don't have structural people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| We don't have geotechnical people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| So you've got bridges over or tunnels under?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Bridges over or tunnels under, and we're going to explore all those options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| This particular consultant has also worked with CSX quite a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| so they know the ins and outs of coordinating with them, and so they have that going for them also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2137)|
| 0:35:45| As a practical matter, we don't have the in-house expertise to really do this, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| I mean, even if we did, we may or may not have the capacity because it's going to take some considerable man hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2150)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| And thank you, Jim, for your comments this week and talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| I mean, $164,000 for a consultant and we get nothing but a plan out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| I mean, is this a high priority to connect Tyson Park with Fort Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| We in the bike community have been talking about this particular barrier for as long as I've been paying attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2179)|
| 0:36:27| which is something like 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| It's come up as number one or number two that whole period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2190)|
| 0:36:38| In our recent bike plan, bike facilities plan, it was number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| It would be the direct connection between both Fort Sanders neighborhood and UT and downtown to any place west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2204)|
| 0:36:58| Right now, all you can do is get on the sidewalk under the CSX railroad bridge or play chicken with traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2218)|
| 0:37:09| And everybody else, I mean, two-way bike traffic and a lot of pedestrians use that sidewalk, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| So that's a really busy under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| I mean, is there an option to expand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| Is that an option as well, not to go under it or go over it, but to increase the width of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| That is one of the options that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| It seems like it helps with traffic there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| You're employing traffic engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| The structure of that bridge is behind some concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| So we don't know what's there, but that is one thing that we're going to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| And it may turn out to be the best option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| I really don't have any idea where we'll go at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| But we have four different streets, four different alleys between those streets that are potential bridge launches or tunnel termini.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2267)|
| 0:37:59| There's the CSX, but there's also the Gulf and Ohio tracks to get past one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2279)|
| 0:38:10| So it is a big challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| And I guess if it were easy, somebody already would have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| And you say it's the second highest priority in connecting greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| And I probably also should make the point that we included enough in the budget to do geotechnical explorations for a viable bridge and a viable tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2304)|
| 0:38:40| So if we have those alternatives that actually work, we can compare those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| It's unlikely that we will have both or that we will take both all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| So we probably won't end up spending that whole budget amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| If I understood it right, you'd hope to have this back by the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| That's their target, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Councilman Dalbosie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Yeah, if I could take you just slightly afield from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| You had mentioned about the sidewalks there and lots of pedestrians use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| I get complaints from people who say that bicycles ride down the sidewalks on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| I mean, are they allowed to do that or are we doing something wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| I guess it's scary to be out on the road and, you know, being worried about being clipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| But people tell me they'll step out of a building or something and someone's whizzing along on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| It is legal to ride a bike on a sidewalk anywhere in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| You all can make that change if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| I don't think the bike community would have a problem with that, particularly downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| There are other places in Knoxville where sidewalks are a critical connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| But there's not much reason to ride downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| Chief, got any footnotes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| Jim was accurate in what he said there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| It's legal to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| It always causes interest for us because you've got folks who will go from the road to the sidewalk and it kind of confuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| Well, the speeds are different between pedestrians and bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| I mean, that's kind of a hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| But I think there's, you know, it causes some confusion with the riders as well as those around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2416)|

| 0:41:51| Yeah, Joe's waiting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| He's been patiently sitting back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| I guess my question is, we had one or more of these before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| How much opportunity is there to get yourself Kaboomed or to Let's Play or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| in different areas of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| Joe Walsh, Parks and Recreation Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| Councilman, they came to us offering these grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| I think there may be a monetary reward associated with getting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| We had a successful Kaboom grant last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| and I really think that organizations look for cities or organizations that are successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| and able to complete projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| So I think that was a reason that we were chosen because of our Kaboom playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| we built at Chihuahua Park last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| Yeah, but is there opportunity to do yet another or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| I think so, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| These come by on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| And the opportunity is realized by working with your office to find out if it can be done someplace else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| I think we're a viable organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| I think that these grantors would be willing to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| They know that we're going to be around for a while and we're just not fly-by-night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2577)|

| 0:45:08| Erin Gale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| If I could ask her a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| I was a little confused by we're getting a grant from CAC to pay the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| but yet we're the ones that usually have to help support CAC because it's funding from the feds always is a shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2716)|
| 0:45:23| How does this work, I mean, this extreme makeover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| Yeah, so Erin Gale, Director of Sustainability for the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| and we do come to you frequently with the weird contracts, so this is one of those, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| If you remember back in, I guess it was September of 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| you all endorsed an application that the city partnered with CAC as well as KUB to apply for funding from TVA for the Knoxville Extreme Energy Makeover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2737)|
| 0:45:48| We were fortunate to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| That program launched in August and has already been doing really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| We actually are, we have 300 homes already since we launched that are either complete or actively underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| So that process is moving forward quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| We heard from David Brace today that it's keeping the permit office busy because building permit office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2763)|
| 0:46:10| people are running in to get projects going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| And that's exactly what this contract amendment is designed to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| So we have, I should say, the CAC will be bringing the permit office 1,278 homes between August of last year and September of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2777)|
| 0:46:27| So that's a huge influx of projects to the CODE's office on top of an already pretty stacked workload that they're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2787)|
| 0:46:35| So because the CAC is under such a tight time constraint with TVA to get these programs and projects finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2795)|
| 0:46:43| they were looking to bring this contract amendment to the city to enable CODE's department to essentially staff up to make sure that they can meet that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2803)|
| 0:46:52| Oh, the capacity to get it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Exactly, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2815)|

| 0:48:25| Rashawn Colbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| Is Rashawn Colbert here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| Not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| Okay, Mr. Kelsey Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| Mr. Finch didn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| Okay, Mr. Hayes, David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| Yeah, I'll get back to her in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| Mr. Hayes, state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| My name is David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| I'm with Black Lives Matter Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| My address is 241 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| What does racism look like in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| It looks like Officer Nate Allen and others saying there is no gang problem in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| than defending the gang task force, a task force which main operation is to criminalize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| harass, and arrest and imprison black folks and youth in the illusion of keeping us safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| It looks like the urban renewal slash Negro removal that displaced our community from the current downtown area decades ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2965)|
| 0:49:33| It looks like white folks in the city making oppressive decisions for black folks, our families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| and our community with the consent of a minimal size of our population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| It looks like our mayor admitting to what we already knew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| that black folks will be exploited if we don't show up to meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| that if we don't show up to some of your city meetings, that we will be exploited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| Racism looks like setting up in an inaccessible meeting culture that keeps this exploitive practice in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3000)|
| 0:50:08| To answer your question, Madeline, about whether or not I think you care, I say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| It is not your intentions that has proven to me that your office is racist and classist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| It's your actions and lack thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| Racism in Knoxville looks like black youth being three times as likely to be kicked out and pushed out of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| through arrests and suspensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| Racism looks like excluding black contractors from city contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| The Kuma Festival, a festival that centers and celebrates black and African culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| Racism looks like Rojero's office attacking and taking away its funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| Carpetbag Theater, it's been a gem in our community since the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| Racism looks like blocking Carpetbag from obtaining space instead of doing everything you can to ensure it has space and funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3056)|
| 0:51:04| The Alliance House, a new community space down MLK that's being spearheaded by Knoxville natives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3064)|
| 0:51:12| Racism looks like the city making them meet every single impossible building and space regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3072)|
| 0:51:19| while dishing out favors and shortcuts to white folks in other parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| Racism is prioritizing your own selfish agenda over the needs of black folks engaging in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3085)|
| 0:51:36| Lies are when you say everyone has supported your gentrification slash redevelopment plan when that is factually and historically not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| To my sisters, siblings, brothers, and elders who are afraid that me and other community members speaking up at events like these will cause the city not to invest on Eastside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3103)|
| 0:51:58| let us first acknowledge how messed up it is that that's even an option for the city to continue to overlook the Eastside with their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3118)|
| 0:52:05| After acknowledging that, I urge you to realize that you, your family, your friends, your coworkers, your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3125)|
| 0:52:12| are worth so much more than the scraps that the city often gives us, if that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3132)|
| 0:52:19| You are worth so much that the city owes it to you to make sure that the apartment and house you're in is affordable in five to ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| You are worth so much the city owes you affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| You are worth so much that they owe it to you to make sure that you have access to healthy food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| Knoxville owes it to you to make sure that you, not outside wealthy investors, own a space on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| You are worth so much and you are so brilliant that you and everyone in your neighborhood deserves the right to collectively dictate what your community looks like and not the people before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3163)|
| 0:52:55| The city doesn't think you're worth it, but we do, and we're going to fight until that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| Did Xavier Presley come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| Ms. Goldman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| Take your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| Okay, hang on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| And pull the microphone down closer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| Hold on, let me get everything together for my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| Hello, my name is Rhonda Goldman, as most of you guys know, and I hope you guys are having a wonderful day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| Well, today I have a few things I'd like to discuss, and the first one being the mobile food unit ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3222)|
| 0:53:51| I'm ignorant when it comes to the details of this, because I just heard about it in a rumor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| And also I got a little bit of information from one of the neighborhood housing meetings, so I would like to get a little more information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| And also we have some of the vendors that are here that are sitting in the back that actually have those and use those for income to provide for their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3245)|
| 0:54:15| So they, too, would like a little more input on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| What I need to find out is, are you guys still seeking the input from the public when it comes to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3259)|
| 0:54:27| Workshop coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| Why don't you go ahead with your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| We'll answer them after the meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| Okay, cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| Now, secondly, I was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| And please state your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| I don't think you did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| 2431 Hoyt Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Now, the second one is the Five Points Master Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| I was sitting in on that meeting yesterday as well, and my biggest concern was with the St. John Baptist Church and the New Salem Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3285)|
| 0:54:54| What I learned was that the members from New Salem were really disappointed because they had been assured on several occasions with three visits from Alvin Nance assuring them that they would get a piece of the property for expansion if needed, you know, with the new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| What has happened is that it was a verbal agreement instead of something on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3298)|
| 0:55:16| They didn't have anything on paper at the time to assure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| So, I was sitting in on that meeting yesterday, and I was told that the St. John Baptist Church was going to be replaced within a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| Again, those two areas have really tight parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| It's a very small church that's going to be set right next to the once-stated, it was going to be like a two-story division, I mean, building here for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3335)|
| 0:55:44| I'm not really for sure, so please forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| So, they're wanting to know why they were left out of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| They were assured by Alvin Nance that they would have some property to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| Now, they're going to look like a morsel compared to the development over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| And it is a community church, and that church has been there for such a long time, unlike some of the newer churches that have come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| And we are the Bible Belt, and of course, you know, a lot of people really care about how they worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| So, if we're going to give them the right to worship, you have some seniors and middle-aged groups that are really concerned about their place of worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3375)|
| 0:56:24| So, I would like to find out more about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| Also, I would like to ask that the Magnolia Corridor...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| We've all been doing our little black history, and you know, it's March the 1st now, so it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| But what's happened is that we're really wanting to see if they can start at the Chihuahua Park and Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| To give us a little assurance of knowing that we are a part of the plan, because once we saw the blueprint, of course, we didn't see ourselves in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3407)|
| 0:56:55| So, it would give the minority some assurance of knowing that I actually like the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| I think it's beautiful, but we want to see ourselves in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| So, the jobs are major concerns, and then the bidding, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| What I was thinking was, is that this time instead, unlike the empowerment zone, the first time we had the five-point development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| why don't we do the bids, give some of the minorities the opportunity to get a partial payment in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| so that this time they can get the equipment that they need and the manpower that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| so that they can share some of the wealth, because we're always getting crumbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3447)|
| 0:57:35| I think I'll just leave it right there, but one of the things, I'm a little worn out from this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| but one of the things I wished is, I wished that with election time, you guys know how it was when you first ran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| You know the promises. Mayor, you came to my booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| I came to your place a couple of times, and I actually voted for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| And when I come here, I come here with expectancy. I expect some results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| But just hold out like we started out. And that's it. So you guys have a wonderful day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| Thank you, Ms. Conner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| Okay, Mr. Colbert, I think he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| So, council, that's the end of public forum, and there being no further business, the meeting's adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160301?start=3495)|
