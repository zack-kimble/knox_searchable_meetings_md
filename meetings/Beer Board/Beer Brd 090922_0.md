| 0:02:16| restaurant since the restaurant is already open with what single manager. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=136)|

| 0:03:04| who hasn't been in for processing. It's one manager. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=184)|

| 0:03:27| have no official. Council meeting. Between now and the up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=207)|
| 0:03:33| the state of death. She said if if we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| a council meeting which is right when they're open to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| six on the six which is actually a day after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| his planned. Quiet opening and I understand how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=222)|
| 0:03:50| I don't know councilman revised mayor Becker. You want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| make a coming here before I make a motion I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| think I do. It would it would it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| much we would all be much happier if you weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| opening on until October 7th. Correct. Is that a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| given that your plan date was October 6th do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| think you you might be ending up a day a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| day late anyway. If it would not be too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| to ask council or the beer board to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| on that day I would be happy to do whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=258)|

| 0:19:07| oh seven Beachwood road. Not so. You're here because you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| had two violations for underage sales. And to present us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| with a plan of what you intend to do to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| prevent that from happening in the future. As I wrote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| to you. What we're going to do is is we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| programmed our registers to where you're you know it's. Yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| punch in a date to make the transaction and. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| know if if the person is not of age than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| it. It won't it won't do the transaction. Basically we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| trying to take the human element out of the. Deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| Thing they have that point. I want to. They have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1194)|
| 0:20:07| been questions councilmember. Yeah I think the cash registers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| are there there are good stuff they help a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| I was a little word struck me when I wrote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| you letter you. You have a line I anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| this being a foolproof method of eliminating underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| And it's not there's still ways. Smart fools can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| around it. We've had we've heard stories of people typing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| in numbers that they know were wrong just to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| around the computer. So I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| you don't fall into a trap of saying great that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| done don't have to worry about anymore. As as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| know managers and owners that you you keep. All the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| other stuff going and don't assume that the cash register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| fixes your. Your problem. Well I think I stated in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| that letter that that we're going to do some internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| auditing on that. To. To be honest I called Kurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| waggle who's a friend of mine and asked him what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| their protocol was. And and you know he made these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| recommendations to me and and he said that we're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| doing internal work and so. I don't know how successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| they've been but. It sounded. At the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| day. I'd like to think my people can do math but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| they can't. And it's you know shame on us and. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| know shame on me but. I don't know what else to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| do if you have a recommendation I'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| Because I sure don't want to. Be up here. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| Roddick. Thank you Mr Butler I I think you understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| that this board considers two violations within a 12 month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| period of a very serious event. And we certainly don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| want to see that third happen which is why we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| asking some of these questions and a follow up question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| that I have for you is. We have a copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| here of the warning notice that was given to one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| of your employees miss clowers. After the incident and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| talks about she was properly trained and yet this event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| still happen. How is your employee training. Other than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| cash register use changed after these two incidents and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| often our employees retrained in this area. Well. We've we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| obviously retrained on the. When we program the registers. To| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| do their thing that was a training process. It's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| daily thing. That we remind them of the importance. Of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| the issue. And the severity of the issue. You know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| we. I don't know if I have a bullet point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1373)|
| 0:23:04| Statement to make. Do you have a doubt tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| more about the training that happens when a new employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| comes on board. Who will be authorized to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| Well we've got a handbook that they get. They they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| to read they have to sign they have to agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| to all of the things in the handbook which include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| Alcohol sales. And it's it's just one on one training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| As far as. You know what do you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| when the person comes forward. How do you ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| the ID. How do you look at the ID. And. Honestly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| we've got signs up and everything and. They just. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| just aren't getting the job done and. I mean. I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| love to tell you that. We are getting the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| done that that we're not. Our new employees evaluated as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| to their assimilation of that knowledge in in the handbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| are they tested or is that discussed or is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| just assume when they sign it that they've actually read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| it. Well it's discussed. I mean we do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| a formal test no. And maybe that's something we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| to do. You know I think what we've heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| business owners is it's it's a two part. Ongoing effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| that there's certainly education on the front end. Before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| folks ever walk in the store and then there's execution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| of that policy when the customers are there. But but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| both are equally important and particularly in that North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| to court or that as we both now has seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| its share of tragedies with with underage. It's just critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| that that everyone hold hands and and make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| the sales don't happen. Thank you. Councilman Baker. Yeah I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| guess at some point I know Miss Rodney and you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| the and the drug commission rep. We have occasionally asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| folks to call them for advice. Are they still doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| that. And is that still a possibility. Yes they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| And there's a representative just behind you from the Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Drug Commission. I'm sure she'll identify herself. And they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| happy to provide stickers and materials and support in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| efforts that we have stickers that can go on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| beer coolers themselves. Reminding folks when they're at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| of sale to try to make that good decision. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1526)|

| 0:25:35| already but maybe there's some ways the Metropolitan Drug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| Commission can can enhance your efforts. Well. And I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| compliment whoever's here. I've gone to ask task which whichever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| it's called now for 20 years. And many many years ago. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| recommended we card everybody. And at the time the guy said it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| wasn't politically expedient to do that. So since that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| you or whoever. Have made it a rule to card everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| And that's been a tremendous help to us because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| don't have this intimidation factor. So. I understand what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| say about signs and all that everybody is getting carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| We are falling short. Calculating dates. And. So it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| like we're not carding everyone. Both the cadets were carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| And it was date calculations. So. Getting back to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| Becker's point. We feel like. The missing link is somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| that can do math and apparently the only one that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| do math is our computer. And. I mean I've got. Opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1605)|
| 0:26:52| on how we've done down the whole generation because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| technology. But that's the fact and I guess I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| have to live with it. You know one of the just I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| think a comment more and I think the the drug commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| still still agrees with this. When we first came in. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| this philosophy of when a clerk sells you're going to fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| him. And what we've learned is that's actually not the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| thing that that's a great training opportunity. So I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| wanted to compliment you on actually having a probation having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| a way to say you made a mistake. Let's look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| as a learning opportunity. I think that's still the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| thinking out there. So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| Councilman Pila. Well I I too had a question about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| training. I think we kind of beaten that to death. But on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| the other hand I was just going to make a comment. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| know when I'm sure when you hire somebody it's just one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| person. Who's sitting with the employer and you're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| Your regulations for that and other other issues about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| employment. And I just I attended one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| Metropolitan Drug Commission's training sessions where I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| it was for managers probably. But it was a room full of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| people and many of them young people. And somehow I got the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| sense that they really got the point. That it wasn't just me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| it's all of us have to follow the same rules. And I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| know if there's any merit in the thought that you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| have an off hours training session for all your employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| at some every every so often. So that they have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| opportunity to realize that these instructions are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| everybody. And they don't want to be the single bad apple in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| the bushel so to speak. I don't know. I just that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| spending an entire day at the University of Tennessee in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| of these sessions was I watched a lot of body language and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| lot of reaction of the people in the room. And I felt like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| was a very worthwhile session for all those people who were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| there. So I mean that may be one thought is getting them all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| together rounded up. Have someone from Metropolitan Drug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| Commission come out and speak to the issue and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| It's quite an interesting program that they put on. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| could really recommend it for for employees and for you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| you're dealing a lot with young people. Right. Right. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| mean I'll be glad to do that. Now obviously. That's just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| thought. That's just one of those ideas that you can float.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| You know just float it out there and see if it would work. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| mean if it would be helpful. But sometimes kids just get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| idea you know. Well. Yeah. I mean I'll try anything. Well I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1776)|
| 0:29:43| mean. Float it by and if it works for you. It's free. No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1783)|
| 0:29:50| cost for that idea. Any further discussion. Thank you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1790)|
| 0:29:59| Good luck. I want to say something. We've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| Maybe we ought to come up with compile a list of suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| and maybe the Metropolitan Drug Commission already has that but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| that we could have readily available in our office of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| things that seem to work or suggestions. So people that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| know because these owners come in here and they obviously are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| scared to death that this is going to happen again and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| you know they'd like to have some help. So now they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| Yeah. We can do sort of like best practices. Yeah. Yes. I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| help you get something together. Thank you. Oh Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1827)|
| 0:30:37| Michael Hartman 12732 Heathland Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| 37934. Yes, you're here because you've had two underage sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| to minors and to present us with a plan of what you intend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| to do to prevent that from happening in the future. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| sir. I brought that plan on Thursday, but I can recap it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| verbally with no problem. We've gone above and beyond. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| believe to make sure this doesn't happen again. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| posted blown up IDs with good IDs and underage IDs. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| in every station. I have twelve copies in each store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| I've also made copies for all the old Charlies in the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| market so people can see this. We have a daily card now that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| has gone over with the employees by the manager at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| bottom of the card. They must sign that they agree to card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| every single person that orders liquor. If the card has a red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| bar, they are not allowed to serve that guest. They have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| bring the license to the manager on duty and only the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| manager on duty can approve the beverage going to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| We also have new signs provided to us by Eagle Distributing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| they're in the bar and in the alley with the dates. We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| have a new program for the managers. Dave Cox, who's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| operational director for the Knoxville market, is allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| come in at any time. Any employee that does not have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| daily sales report in their service checkbook, the manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| on duty is immediately terminated. We also have gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| to Pierre. We have role plays at each meeting in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| We pick one server to card somebody and see how they do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| without offending the guests. You know the guests that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| obviously over 21 years of age. Unfortunately, my guest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| complaints have gone way up since January since we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| carded every single person. I have gentlemen that are a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| little upset that they're 60, 65 years old having to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| their ID, but I explained to them that it is our company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| policy and that we will continue to do so. I gotta tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| you that the conviction of my staff right now, knowing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| we could be out of business is just amazing. There has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| been a time that I've been in that restaurant in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| nine months that we're not carding everybody that orders a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| Councilman Baker. Thank you. I guess two questions. I hope you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| listen to the last discussion. I think there's always a value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| of hearing what's going on. Do you have a policy that you fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| servers who get caught or do you have you thought about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| What's your both the employees that served the cadet carded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| the cadet and then chose to serve the cadet anyway. Both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| those people were terminated that day. Now, I understand I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| listened very carefully to the conversation about counseling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| to give those people a chance, but you know Charlie's training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| you go through a five-day training period and two of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| those days is on alcohol. At the end of those two days, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| sign a book saying that this is your formal counseling and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| first warning and we make it a point because the zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| tolerance policy for us is pretty. Okay. I mean it's we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| obviously we fired both of them and they're still the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| gentleman that got fired called the first gentleman idiot for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| not carding the first one, you know and he got fired for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| doing the same thing. So it's just crazy. So we we go with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| zero tolerance policy because they signed that that paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| that that works that works. I guess the other question I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| is I'm a fan of the law that requires off premise sales to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| show an ID that takes it out of the clerk's hand. Somebody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| mad call me. It was my you actually have that policy now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| for folks in the store and I wonder if you can say what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| would your thinking be? Would it be easier if there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| citywide policy that said everybody's gotta do it. Can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| blame you. They can blame us. Does that help or not? You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| know, absolutely. I use Ingalls and Kroger as my example. When| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| I when I go to the table and I say, you know, you can tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| that I'm over 21. I have a a child here that's older than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| you and I said, well, I understand that but it's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| policy that we card every single person that orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| liquor. I said, when you go to Kroger Ingalls, you can't buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| beer at the checkout unless you have an ID with the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| punched in, correct? And he goes, yeah, but this isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Kroger's or Ingalls and I go, but yeah, but we follow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| same policy. So, it's not, it's getting better for me. I went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| through a three-month period where my liquor sales fell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| because people were like kind of frustrated they had to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| their ID but it's coming back. You know, fortunately, I'm I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| went from 26% down and now I'm only 8% down. So, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| they're getting used to carding. Good. Thank you. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| other questions or comments? Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2119)|

| 0:35:54| You're here because you've had two underage sales to minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| and to present us with a plan of what you intend to do to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| prevent that from happening in the future. Okay. Yeah, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| sorry. I'm just going to talk a little bit. Yeah, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| doing the same thing on all registers, functioning in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| numbers and okay and they're like the whole task book. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2172)|
| 0:36:22| translate it into Spanish and they're still doing the a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| class every month to everyone in everyone that works for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| It's a class every month and then after that, they take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| quiz. Also, she makes them sign it and she checks, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| well, the correct and incorrect answers and they talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| you know, she talks individually too about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| they had got it wrong and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| Yeah. Councilman Becker. I guess two things. One, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2217)|
| 0:37:07| something in here where you're actually getting the cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| registers that require a birthday punch in. Yes. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| heard the earlier discussion. It's not. Yeah, I was here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| then I also think I heard you. I couldn't see the face or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| didn't listen to the name but yeah, she's also asking, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| know, if you know what else can she do, you know, to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| this from happening, you know, she's willing to do try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| anything, suggestions or whatever. So, the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| question actually is I guess for officer Husky, Spanish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| language training for the task program. Is that something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| we've got? That is not. I mean, I've never thought of it but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| but it's we have several different languages that come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| to the class and they used to bring them an interpreter but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| was approached by the Metropolitan Drug Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| tonight. We may be may try to set up some type of Spanish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| classes. And I guess for the drug commission, the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| handouts, are there Spanish handouts as well that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| have? I mean, I know it's a lot more bumper sticker kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| stuff. It's but is there something? Alright, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| Again, talking to the drug commission folks is a is a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| way for for ideas on on what's doable. Councilman. Well, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2293)|
| 0:38:21| thing that concerns me about this one is that in both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| violations, the same person was cited just under, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| just under six months apart but both of them were convictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| and but it's the same person. And I guess that's what really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| concerns me. That's, you know, changes should have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| the first time. That person should have been dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| trained, fired, something should have happened. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| that's the red flag for me. So, I'm going to make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| send this on for a suspension of revocation here. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| person still an employee? She is but she's not allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| sell any more beer at all. And she's asked, you know, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| whoever's at the cash register, well, before they would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| had the the year and then now they have the the month, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| day, and the year, and everything. I'll come out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| talk with you all tomorrow because she cannot work there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| anymore. Okay, so that the attorney said that it was okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2364)|
| 0:39:32| but I mean, she's fine, you know? Okay. Okay. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| motion to attempt a suspension of revocation here. Was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2377)|
| 0:39:44| your motion? That was a motion. You know, the next thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| on the agenda is to give them a permit. I understand. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2387)|
| 0:39:58| I mean, it's not the same people I don't guess. And she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| just told me that. Well, Councilman Becker. I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| Miss Rookwood, I usually am quite willing to send things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| for a year. In this case, my gut says no and I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| your logic on it. I tend to look at carding happening and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| my kind of gut is if they're carding, it's still a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| but they're making more steps and I think now that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| they've got the computer set up, I feel like I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| going to support your motion. Okay, well, if there's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| second, it won't go anywhere. I thought I'd say why I wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| jumping in like I normally would be. Would you restate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| your motion, Councilman Hallquist? It was just to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| this one off on for a suspension revocation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2447)|
| 0:40:55| Councilman Pila. Oh, Councilman Raleigh. Mr. Hall, would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| clarify for me the relationship between the individuals that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| standing in front of us now and the discussion of suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| revocation and then the permit that we delayed? I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| I'm clear on that. It's my understanding that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| ownership is changing hands. Now, there are some, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| some of the same employees are going to be retained. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| correct? Yes. But it will be a different ownership. So, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| send this to suspension revocation and the decision of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| that body is to revoke the permit, it wouldn't affect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| permit that, assuming that the next permit is approved, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| just say. They have to turn in their permit to get the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| permit. So, they won't have a permit. Previous owners. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| Is that correct? Yes. But if we approve the application for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| permit tonight, I mean, it'll be some time before this would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| to suspension revocation. So, if we approve the permit that's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| front of us tonight, the former owners would still have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| active permit until that decision were made to suspend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| revoke or whatever. Until the permit is issued. They won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| release the new permit until the old permit is surrendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| And so, they will voluntarily give up the old permit before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| the new permit actually gets issued. But can't they give that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| up before the suspension revocation hearing? Sure. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| can. I guess I'm trying to understand the point of sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| this permit holder to. Yeah, there may be no point and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| be glad to withdraw if because they could just, they would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| surrendering it anyway. Thank you. I'll withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| Officer Husky wants to make a comment. On our current permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| it has Guadalupe Hernandez as the owner and this owner will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| be Francisco and it has Leticia Hernandez as the manager on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| old one and she will be the manager on this one. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| correct? Okay. So, that's the same manager but different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| I just want to ask a question which may not really be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| order and yet, I really have some concerns about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| understanding about the employee not being able to work in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| establishment. I think it's in any establishment for a period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| of time, right? For a period of 10 years. That was my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| understanding and consequently, I really feel that until we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| have determined if this has been properly handled, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| don't want to take a position on this because I'm not confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| that the ownership management understands that an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| must be terminated and cannot continue to work. I'm having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| real concern about grasping what's what responsibilities one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| has with a permit as a permit holder. Councilman Becker. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| know, I hear your concern, Ms. Pilo. I think the answer we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| is she said, well, I talked to the lawyer or a lawyer who said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| we could do it and interestingly, when when Officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| Husky said you can't, it was okay. Well, I understand but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| every now and then, I run into lots of folks that say okay but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| I I'm just having a I'm sorry. I'm just having a real problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| under if if we don't understand something so clear as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| Gosh. Councilman Rowley. I can't even finish the sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2683)|
| 0:44:50| because I don't really know where to go with it but I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| having a real problem here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. She I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| think she didn't know that, you know, after two times, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| would have to be terminated. She was just going by what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| person's lawyer was saying. I'm not worried about what she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| knows. I'm worried about what you know. Me? Or the owner? What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| you all know. And and I'm worried about what attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| would tell you that. Oh, okay. Councilman Rowley. And I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| wear that laces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| Officer Husky. Um I'm not clear on the employment status of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| Miss Arroyo. She is currently still employed at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| restaurant. That's what they just said. Okay. Um although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| she has two convictions. If if you have a conviction, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| cannot, you cannot be employed there. Whether you sell beer or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| not, you cannot be employed at a place that sells beer for 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| years. So, the first conviction should have. The first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| conviction should have taken care of that. Yes and it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| like this one happened five months after that. And then she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| had a second conviction and the the order of of the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| following a conviction. I'm just trying to understand this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| is that someone with that conviction cannot serve in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| restaurant where the where the event took place nor any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| restaurant where alcohol is served for 10 years. Right. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| of them. And yet she's still an employee at this restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| That that technically is a violation for the for the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| for employing them too. It works both ways. Mr. Hallquist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| is your motion still on the floor? No, I withdrew. Um then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| I'll make a motion to send this to suspension revocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| hearing. Okay. Well, this could get interesting. I guess I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| We have a motion to send them to a suspension revocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| hearing. We've got a second. All in favor, say aye. Opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| Two. Two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| You will be contacted. The present owner will be contacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| as to a date and time to appear for suspension revocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| hearing. Okay. And I have and the suspension, how would that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| affect to the new owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| We're getting ready to find out. Right now, the new owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| doesn't have a permit. Yeah. That's what we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| right now. So, lost in the market. Give me your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| address again. 2412 Washington Pike. Officer Husky. No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| alcohol record. Miss Martin. Uh waiting on a final business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| To approve any final documents. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| You just got Councilman Becker. Yeah. Mr. Swanson, can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| explain to us what impact the fact that a similar set of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| people are getting a suspension revocation hearing in a similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| location? Does that have any impact on this? And if so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| what? No, it really doesn't. I think it would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| to mention to the new ownership that Miss Arroyo is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| eligible to serve as an employee in any any way related to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| sale of beer at this establishment for 10 years from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| the date of the conviction. So, I think they should be aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| that and if they consulted a lawyer who told them otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| they need to consult yet another lawyer. Let me clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| something. Can she be an employee of this market? No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| permittee shall employ a person to be in any manner involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| the sale of beer, parentheses, including the management of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| establishment where beer is sold or direct supervision of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| employees selling beer, close parentheses, who has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| convicted of any violation of any ordinance related to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| sale, storage, possession with intent to resell or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| redistribute, manufacture, or transportation of beer, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| convicted of any violation of the laws against the sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| storage, possession with intent to resale or redistribute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| manufacture, or transportation of beer, or any felony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2960)|
| 0:49:27| Pretty clear. So, what does that mean? Just said to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| the state law says she can't work there. Can't be in any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| manner involved in the sale of beer. I think those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| important words in that she can't be in any way related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| the sale of beer. If she's just working there carrying out the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| trash and and not in any way related to the sale of beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| then, I don't think that violates this ordinance because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| it very specifically says involved in the sale of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| She's being employed. Well, I'm just reading you the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=2997)|
| 0:50:04| Okay. Quick question. Can we follow up and see if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| city ordinance is confusing with regard to the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| and fix the city ordinance if it is because it feels like if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| if the city ordinance says that and the state law says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| something different, I'm not surprised that there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| lawyer who said you can keep her. Typically, we try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| pattern our city ordinance after the state law and frankly, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| thought we had in this case but if we haven't, I'll I'll let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| you know. Thank you. Thank you because it's contrary to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| I've always understood. Councilman Roddick. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| This question is for mister Swanson. If this permit that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| in front of us is denied, remind me again how long the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| applicant has before they can come back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| Next month, they can they can reapply. Now, if you if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| deny them and they come back, then they're sort of on notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3060)|
| 0:51:07| that they very well may not get a permit again. But I would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3067)|
| 0:51:15| interested in the basis for a denial. What did he say? Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| further of councilman? I was going to ask you mister| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Swanson. Do you see any grounds for denial? I do not. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| you. Officer Husky, I just want to ask a question. What do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| do after someone's been convicted and they're found to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| sell to an underage a second time? What what kind of action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| or what what do we do or say or how do we enforce that or as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| far as you know, letting them know, you know, they're they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| in violation that they should not be involved in the handling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| of beer again. We've I've just had to come up a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| times and we went out and they had they hadn't gotten rid of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| their employee. This one just just now popped in my face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| Maybe we ought to do something formal. A letter or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| like that. I mean, just to make sure we cover our a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| times the conviction comes two years down the road to two or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| three years down the road. It's not right after it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| Right. Any further discussion? Are we ready to vote? All in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| favor, say aye. Opposed, no. The ayes have it. One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3138)|
| 0:52:25| Thank you. Thank you. Is there any other business needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3145)|
| 0:52:34| come before the beer board? I get a motion to adjourn. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| stand adjourned. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090922?start=3158)|
