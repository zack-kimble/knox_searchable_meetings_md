| 5:14:47| technological system of surveillance and control has been and continues to be quickly installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18887)|
| 5:14:52| around us. Not only is 5G a system of surveillance and control, but it has not been proven safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18892)|
| 5:14:58| and the FCC made it clear that they did zero safety studies before beginning to roll it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18898)|
| 5:15:03| We do already have an overwhelming amount of evidence showing biological harm from microwave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18903)|
| 5:15:07| radiation at the 2G, 3G, and 4G levels, and no studies that show 5G is safe. So I want to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18907)|
| 5:15:15| this opportunity, I think this is allowed, just to invite everyone here and anyone who watches this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18915)|
| 5:15:21| to apply your passion, energy, and effort to work together toward halting this greater threat of 5G| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18921)|
| 5:15:28| before even more of these harmful antennas are installed without our consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18928)|
| 5:15:34| Thank you, Ms. Bradford. Am I done? Yes, ma'am. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18934)|
| 5:15:39| Todd Fromeyer, 1551 Lawrence Glen Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923. Mr. Chairman, Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18939)|
| 5:15:46| before I was going to talk on land use, before I get to that, I just wanted to say a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18946)|
| 5:15:49| words in support of Colonel O'Brien, who was called out several times tonight. I'm a 20-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18949)|
| 5:15:55| military veteran and spent 12 years on active duty in the Air Force, and I'm here to say a few words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18955)|
| 5:16:00| in support of Colonel O'Brien, who was called out several times tonight. I'm a 20-year military| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18960)|
| 5:16:06| veteran and spent 12 years on active duty in the Air Force. My wife is a doctor and also spent a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18966)|
| 5:16:11| period of time on active duty in the Air Force as an OBGYN at Eglin Air Force Base. We stand with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18971)|
| 5:16:17| the Board of Health and specifically with Colonel O'Brien. I think we can all aspire to the level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18977)|
| 5:16:22| public service that Colonel O'Brien has shown, both for his military service and his service to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18982)|
| 5:16:29| our community. Thank you. So in looking at the campaign disclosures from commission races over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18989)|
| 5:16:37| the last six years or so, which you can find at the Election Commission website, I found it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=18997)|
| 5:16:41| not uncommon for candidates for commission to raise tens of thousands of dollars for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19001)|
| 5:16:44| campaigns. On top of the sums of money involved, I also noted two things about commission campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19004)|
| 5:16:50| contributions. First, the vast majority of them tend to come in large chunks, $500, $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19010)|
| 5:16:56| $1,500 checks. It appears that well over half of the money raised in these races comes in the form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19016)|
| 5:17:01| of what I call big money donations. The individual limit in these races is $1,600 per election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19021)|
| 5:17:07| and many donors come close to maxing out their donations. Second, I was interested to see from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19027)|
| 5:17:12| whom the money came. Yeah, the names many people know from Knoxville and Knox County were frequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19032)|
| 5:17:16| big money donors, but actually a large percentage of the money in general, and the big money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19036)|
| 5:17:21| donations specifically, came from people who would have reason to care about the zoning decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19041)|
| 5:17:26| made by this commission. Developers, builders, people involved in real estate are frequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19046)|
| 5:17:31| contributors of big money donations. So it's not uncommon to see developers who have donated to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19051)|
| 5:17:36| county commission campaigns here before commission asking for a zoning change so that they can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19056)|
| 5:17:41| forward with whatever development they have planned. Now there's nothing illegal about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19061)|
| 5:17:46| I didn't come across a single instance where a contributor had violated the limits on donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19066)|
| 5:17:51| Everything else aside though, I think this looks bad. Many of the most impactful votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19071)|
| 5:17:56| taken by the commission, votes that will affect the lives of many people, come on these land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19076)|
| 5:18:00| issues. Now of course I'd like to see campaign funding reform nationwide. The Citizens United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19080)|
| 5:18:05| decision is just the worst. But maybe we can strive to do better here in Knox County than we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19085)|
| 5:18:10| see on the state or national level. So I'm going to put a bug in your ear about this as an area for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19090)|
| 5:18:14| potential reform, and let's call this my first attempt to provide some sunshine on this murky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19094)|
| 5:18:20| area. To that end, I looked at the items on the land use part of the agenda tonight and did a run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19100)|
| 5:18:25| through the financial disclosures for the current county commissioners, and here's what I found. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19105)|
| 5:18:30| I found two items that were on there that had some items of interest. The S&E properties one was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19110)|
| 5:18:38| number 76, but they withdrew. So I'll hold that information for another time. But then as I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19118)|
| 5:18:44| going through, and I thought I was only going to be speaking about the S&E properties item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19124)|
| 5:18:49| I came across a Mr. Ryan Hickey who listed his employment as Ball Homes, and I think he was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19129)|
| 5:18:53| earlier. Ball Homes had the request pending, I think it was number 64 on the agenda. So over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19133)|
| 5:18:59| course of five campaigns in the 2018 and 2020 cycles, Mr. Hickey donated $2,500 to five different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19139)|
| 5:19:07| commission candidates, four of whom won their races and are sitting on the commission now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19147)|
| 5:19:13| Now I want to remind everyone that might be watching or listening to this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19153)|
| 5:19:17| that this is publicly available on the election commission website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19157)|
| 5:19:21| and I want to encourage everyone that they should do their due diligence when they look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19161)|
| 5:19:26| at the items that are on the land use part of the agenda for county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19166)|
| 5:19:31| The other issues that have been discussed tonight are getting a lot more attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19171)|
| 5:19:35| but this is very important. So candidates have to file their disclosures during campaign season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19175)|
| 5:19:40| at least quarterly, and sometimes more frequently. Everyone should consider going and checking out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19180)|
| 5:19:44| the election commission website, knoxvotes.org, for this kind of information, as well as any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19184)|
| 5:19:51| information about the upcoming election in November. And so whichever place you stand on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19191)|
| 5:19:55| the issue tonight, I hope everyone comes out and votes because it's a big election on November 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19195)|
| 5:19:59| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Frommeyer. That concludes public forum. I'm going to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19199)|
| 5:20:05| around the agenda a few items to expedite. Our first item that we're going to review is number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19205)|
| 5:20:12| 60. I'm going to ask the clerk to read the caption into the record. I will then entertain a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19212)|
| 5:20:17| motion to begin discussion, and then I will have pre-scheduled comments by Dr. O'Brien, Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19217)|
| 5:20:28| and then open it up for commissioners, as well. Madam Clerk. This is R-20-9-907,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19228)|
| 5:20:35| consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee, regarding Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19235)|
| 5:20:39| policies related to regulations of the Knox County Board of Health and executive orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19239)|
| 5:20:44| of Governor Lee and the Tennessee Department of Health address the COVID-19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19244)|
| 5:20:52| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19252)|
| 5:20:58| So moved. Motion to approve. Second. Is that, what is the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19258)|
| 5:21:04| Motion to approve. Motion to approve by Commissioner Biggs. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19264)|
| 5:21:07| Second. Second by Commissioner Ward. Before going to discussion amongst the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19267)|
| 5:21:14| we have Dr. O'Brien, Dr. Buchanan here available to address this resolution. As they are pulling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19274)|
| 5:21:22| up, Dr., do you have a preference? Do you want to go give us a second? Dr. O'Brien,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19282)|
| 5:21:27| would you like to join us at the podium, please? State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19287)|
| 5:21:37| Hey, Commissioner. Earlier this, uh, earlier, speaking into the mic, and please tell us your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19297)|
| 5:21:42| name and address. Actually, you don't have to give your address since you're a member of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19302)|
| 5:21:46| County, but please identify yourself. Sure. It's Mike Danilo, 400 Main Street. Last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19306)|
| 5:21:52| Mayor Jacobs said he would stand beside Dr. O'Brien in the sign of support. Unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19312)|
| 5:21:58| he and the chief of staff were involved in a very minor car accident this afternoon when someone hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19318)|
| 5:22:02| them from behind. So, um, he's okay. There's no injuries. Uh, chief of staff got a little banged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19322)|
| 5:22:10| up, and because of that, the doctor advised the mayor to err on the side of caution, to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19330)|
| 5:22:14| and rest tonight. Uh, they'll both be back in the office tomorrow. Uh, in the meantime, myself and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19334)|
| 5:22:20| Deputy Chief, uh, Chief of Staff Chris Caldwell said would, uh, stand in the mayor's place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19340)|
| 5:22:25| Thank you for the update, and we do hope that both the chief of staff and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19345)|
| 5:22:29| recover quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19349)|
| 5:22:32| Dr. O'Brien, would you please state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19352)|
| 5:22:35| Yeah, Dr. Pat O'Brien, live in Farragut, 37934, Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19355)|
| 5:22:42| Thank you, sir. The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19362)|
| 5:22:46| I'm here for your questions and, uh, anything I can fill in as a member of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19366)|
| 5:22:53| First thing, I will say one thing for, for the Board of Health. We are a group that is put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19373)|
| 5:22:59| together, uh, under the state law, under the direction, and we are voted in by U.S. County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19379)|
| 5:23:05| Commission to help the people of this county, uh, look at public health issues. Our normal work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19385)|
| 5:23:15| outside the time of the pandemic would be things that are normal for a Board of Health. We would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19395)|
| 5:23:21| look at rabies. We would look at flu vaccines. We're looking at budgets. We have been thrust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19401)|
| 5:23:28| into something much more during this time, so we are trying to do the job that has, uh, come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19408)|
| 5:23:37| We are here to act in the best interest of each of the citizens of this county. We don't do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19417)|
| 5:23:44| with any political motive. We don't do it for any other reason. We come from a variety of backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19424)|
| 5:23:51| I am an emergency physician. I'm a colonel in the United States Air Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19431)|
| 5:23:55| My sub-specialty has been emergency medical services for over 35 years, and I'm somebody who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19435)|
| 5:24:04| has been, uh, deployed overseas. A comment made about ISIS last week was not about the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19444)|
| 5:24:10| here. It's really the group that I was the most worried about in my life because of being where I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19450)|
| 5:24:17| was, uh, not about the people of this community. I love the people of this community. They are good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19457)|
| 5:24:23| people. We have differences of opinion, but we are here to assist this county with making the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19463)|
| 5:24:32| best decisions that we can based on the information that presents itself at the time, so we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19472)|
| 5:24:38| basically scientists of varying types, and we, uh, we are here to try to do the best we can for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19478)|
| 5:24:44| everybody, so I want to see if there are any questions from anybody, Mr. J or any other, uh, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19484)|
| 5:24:50| Are there any questions from any commissioners for Dr. O'Brien? Commissioner Smith? Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19490)|
| 5:24:58| Commissioner Hill? Um, not a question, but just a comment and a statement. Regardless of what this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19498)|
| 5:25:06| um, this board decides, I can speak for myself anyway. In no way, um, has, have I ever thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19506)|

| 5:25:24| that this whole situation got to the point where it did, that somehow the Board of Health became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19524)|
| 5:25:30| our enemy instead of our friend. Um, that was, that was wrong. I do not, I do not support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19530)|
| 5:25:38| whether I support what you've done or not. I do not support that this is the attitude that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19538)|
| 5:25:43| our community has taken, and, um, I do not think it speaks well for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19543)|
| 5:25:50| Thank you, Miss Hill. Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19550)|

| 5:26:01| uh, I thank you for your service. I know every one of you on the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19561)|
| 5:26:06| uh, have been put in a position that you probably didn't think you would ever be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19566)|
| 5:26:12| or have any desire to actually be in. I want you to know that, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19572)|
| 5:26:17| I feel your function's important. I hope you understand what we're up against also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19577)|
| 5:26:24| but I just want to make sure you and the rest of people on the Board of Health know that you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19584)|
| 5:26:27| appreciated. Thank you very much. We, we appreciate that, and we just want, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19587)|
| 5:26:33| we are put in that position based on state law. We are doing what we were told, uh, was our duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19593)|
| 5:26:40| and we're trying to do the duty to the best of our ability with the information that we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19600)|
| 5:26:45| on a daily basis. We're each volunteers. We have to read a lot of material every day. We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19605)|
| 5:26:55| go through and read the emails we get from the citizens. I do that every day besides everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19615)|
| 5:27:01| else going on in the world. So, uh, it's, it's just a phenomenal group of people to be associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19621)|
| 5:27:07| with in the Knox County Health Department. We are blessed with who we have there, from Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19627)|

| 5:27:21| they're wrong. We, we are safer because of their work. We can, I sleep better at night knowing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19641)|
| 5:27:28| information I get from them, and I look at that compared to information that we get from other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19648)|
| 5:27:33| sources, but I feel really good about our information that we're getting locally. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19653)|
| 5:27:38| as a physician, I can state that and state that unequivocally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19658)|
| 5:27:44| Thank you, Commissioners. Are you, have you, I have a question. It's really not a technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19664)|
| 5:27:49| question. I, uh, I just, it seems that a lot of this has been politicized, and there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19669)|
| 5:27:55| fear out there amongst people, and, you know, this is a, it's a serious disease. There, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19675)|
| 5:28:01| things that, that we don't know about it, and I believe that scientists and doctors should and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19681)|
| 5:28:08| have admitted that they don't know everything about it. What can the Board of Health do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19688)|
| 5:28:13| to help calm those fears and still make sure that people are being rational and behaving in ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19693)|
| 5:28:19| that, that, that, that are, uh, advantage, that gives an advantage to us being able to control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19699)|
| 5:28:25| this, and I, I heard someone say that we couldn't do anything till we got to zero community spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19705)|
| 5:28:33| I don't think that's possible without a vaccine, and even with a vaccine, I don't think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19713)|
| 5:28:37| possible. Where, where is our, where's our soft spot, our good ground? Where do we need to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19717)|
| 5:28:45| You know, I'm concerned that testing's going down. Would you all ever mandate testing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19725)|
| 5:28:51| Is that anything you all would consider doing? Because to me, that's a bit scary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19731)|
| 5:28:56| but what can, what can the Board of Health do to, at the same time, promote good health in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19736)|
| 5:29:02| community and address this issue and also relieve some of the fear and anxiety? Because I'll tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19742)|
| 5:29:08| you, I know people that were perfectly healthy a year ago. They haven't got COVID, but their health's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19748)|
| 5:29:14| going down from anxiety and depression, and that's affecting a lot of people, and I worry sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19754)|
| 5:29:21| about the, the long-range effects that's going to have on people, and I'm just wondering, I, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19761)|
| 5:29:26| you don't like to take the whole approach of it, but I want to make sure you're all not focusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19766)|
| 5:29:33| too much on COVID-19, that we are letting other things that are going to have long-term effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19773)|
| 5:29:40| when our society happen. May I defer to Dr. Buchanan, who is present on video with us, to let her start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19780)|
| 5:29:51| Sure, thank you. It's been given to you. Thank you. Can you hear me? If you could turn it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19791)|
| 5:30:00| Zach, please, as much as possible. Okay. Sorry. Just want to make sure everybody is. How are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19800)|
| 5:30:06| good now? Keep going. Let's go. Okay. Thank you. So, I can't see any of you, so I apologize for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19806)|
| 5:30:17| that. Commissioner Smith, you are correct, that there are other parts of our, the health of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19817)|

| 5:30:32| some of those concerns, I want you to know that our staff, my staff, is resuming some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19832)|
| 5:30:38| activities. We're resuming our efforts with All4Knox around substance misuse. We're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19838)|
| 5:30:45| bringing new staff on, so that we can allow our staff that focus on other things to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19845)|
| 5:30:51| focus on those other things, such as obesity, diabetes, and smoking cessation, and mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19851)|
| 5:30:59| health related to substance abuse. So, we are aware of that, and we are making every effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19859)|
| 5:31:03| we can to address those issues. Yes, our efforts have been very much focused on COVID, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19863)|
| 5:31:10| that's really been the thing in front of us, making many people in our community ill, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19870)|
| 5:31:14| even taking the lives of some. And I would echo that. I mean, this is a real disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19874)|
| 5:31:23| I have personally been affected by it from people I know. I had somebody from my church just pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19883)|
| 5:31:29| away. Somebody without pre-existing conditions who got it, and he passed away, and his wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19889)|
| 5:31:36| did okay. So, it is here in our community. We do have the concern, and as a member of the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19896)|
| 5:31:42| of Health, we have to look out for those who are vulnerable in our community. Yes, just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19902)|
| 5:31:48| children may not themselves get serious disease, they and young people can spread it to others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19908)|
| 5:31:53| throughout the community, so that you will start to see spikes over time that affect other age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19913)|
| 5:31:59| groups, and that's where we start to have problems. So, we don't want to get to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19919)|
| 5:32:06| where we, as Knox County, decrease our guard enough that this disease, in conjunction with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19926)|
| 5:32:14| other respiratory illnesses like the flu, really hit us hard in the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19934)|
| 5:32:20| So, we need to be very vigilant. We need to continue to do the five core actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19940)|
| 5:32:26| If not, models that are out there that we look at are not good if we don't do that, and we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19946)|
| 5:32:34| to make those models not the truth. We want them to be just that, a model that we never,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19954)|
| 5:32:42| you know, we didn't have that happen to us. We have to look at the information that's presented to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19962)|
| 5:32:47| and we have to make decisions based on that. So, we're trying to balance that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19967)|
| 5:32:53| As a community, we have fewer regulations that we, as the Board of Health, have enacted than a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19973)|
| 5:32:59| lot of places around the country, so we try to balance out the business aspects with pure public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19979)|
| 5:33:06| health and the aspects of just socialization. So, that's where we came to a compromise with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19986)|
| 5:33:13| what we did with the closing. The mask mandate is our cornerstone, along with the rest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19993)|
| 5:33:19| other core actions, and we just ask, please, to work with us on this so that we can try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=19999)|
| 5:33:26| a critical mass of people who do not spread disease, so this thing will snuff itself out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20006)|
| 5:33:32| as best it can. It will never go away completely, but we want it to be gone enough that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20012)|
| 5:33:37| resume life more like what we knew here months ago. Commissioner Smith? Yeah, I do want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20017)|
| 5:33:45| one question before I pass to my fellow commissioners on their first round. Looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20025)|
| 5:33:50| the data, you know, Knox County is a fairly young place with the population of under 44, composing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20030)|
| 5:33:56| about 65%, yet you find 70% of the cases there almost. I understand that with UT back in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20036)|
| 5:34:06| that we were worried about the problems there and the effects of having crowded people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20046)|
| 5:34:12| crowded masses, in the bars and the strip. Being a formal UT student a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20052)|
| 5:34:20| I wonder, have you asked the Knoxville Police Department to go to the strip and help enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20060)|
| 5:34:24| the underage drinking laws? I think that could cut down on the number of people in those bars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20064)|
| 5:34:32| Again, that's not something that we don't do, the enforcement, as we have been told. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20072)|
| 5:34:36| work on regulations, and regulations are already in force for the police to be able to do that. Both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20076)|
| 5:34:41| KPD and UTPD, and we have to rely on them to kind of handle that aspect of it. We have tried to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20081)|
| 5:34:50| again, just do as little as we could to get the most bang for our buck, and that's what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20090)|
| 5:34:56| really trying to do in this case. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Before I pass the baton to Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20096)|
| 5:35:05| Schoonmaker and Bussler, I did have a question. Dr. Bryan, could you talk to us about the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20105)|
| 5:35:10| of the Board of Health? Is the way our Board of Health atypical of other boards of health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20110)|
| 5:35:16| either in our state or in our country? And if you have any knowledge about sort of why it was set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20116)|
| 5:35:22| up that way, and why the mix of different medical professionals are the way they are, along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20122)|
| 5:35:30| two other representatives, and maybe a third that we're heading towards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20130)|
| 5:35:36| What I understand boards of health, and looking at this, and I'll let also Dr. Buchanan comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20136)|
| 5:35:41| but my understanding is we are the standard. The standard is a group of volunteer health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20141)|
| 5:35:48| professionals coming together and making these sorts of decisions. There's not a Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20148)|
| 5:35:54| that I know of in the United States of America that is elected, so we meet the same standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20154)|
| 5:36:01| that every other Board of Health in this country has right now. So that's the first thing. Second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20161)|
| 5:36:08| our Board of Health is made up of a mix of health professionals. We are not all supposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20168)|
| 5:36:13| epidemiologists. We're supposed to be health professionals with a variety of backgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20173)|
| 5:36:18| who can critically look at information that's presented to us. So we happen to have a veterinarian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20178)|
| 5:36:23| who's a public health expert on the faculty from UT. We have a doctor of nursing practice from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20183)|
| 5:36:30| We have an oral surgeon on the faculty at UT Medical Center, and on and on. So all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20190)|
| 5:36:36| together brings a certain way of looking at scientific data, and in doing so, we hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20196)|
| 5:36:43| come to a reasonable conclusion to guide us through a problem, and the problem right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20203)|
| 5:36:51| is the worst we have ever seen, the worst in my lifetime, and I hope it's the worst we'll see from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20211)|
| 5:36:56| this point forward. But we do follow the law. The law was established, as it was mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20216)|
| 5:37:04| in the TCA back in the 80s, and we were set up that way, and we just happened to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20224)|
| 5:37:10| here recently that we had a lot more responsibility than we thought we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20230)|
| 5:37:15| Following up on that, is there any Board of Health that you're aware of that reports directly to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20235)|
| 5:37:20| legislative body after decisions are made by the Board of Health? I don't know of any. Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20240)|
| 5:37:25| do you know of any? I'm only aware of the ones around the state, and I'm not aware of any of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20245)|
| 5:37:33| them reporting to a legislative body, just not to my knowledge. Thank you very much, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20253)|
| 5:37:40| Schoonmaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. O'Brien, I kind of echo the comments from my colleague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20260)|
| 5:37:51| Commissioner Smith, that we admire anybody who serves on a board for Knox County. It's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20271)|
| 5:37:58| tough to even find citizens who want to serve on a board, whatever it may be with Knox County, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20278)|
| 5:38:06| I guess I don't sugarcoat things. I'm just a regular guy. I tell it like it is, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20286)|
| 5:38:14| I was very disappointed in the July meeting of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20294)|
| 5:38:22| And this, again, it's the Knox County Board of Health, and apparently you had made the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20302)|
| 5:38:30| to go out and hire legal counsel to provide guidance and a resolution to present to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20310)|
| 5:38:38| for a decision. You consulted the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20318)|
| 5:38:44| but you didn't even consult anybody in Knox County. And, you know, there's way more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20324)|
| 5:38:51| that live in Knox County than do in the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut. And so I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20331)|
| 5:38:57| I was a little disturbed that why that you guys just totally went away from your designated legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20337)|
| 5:39:05| counsel for the Board of Health, and you went outside and hired your own attorney to draw up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20345)|
| 5:39:11| the ordinance. Could you explain that to me, why that process happened? Yeah. First, nobody was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20351)|
| 5:39:17| hired. Nobody was hired. So it was a comp deal for the attorney? This was somebody offering to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20357)|
| 5:39:28| craft some information together for us and for me. One of the problems we've had as the Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20368)|
| 5:39:34| Health is, and this is as collegial health professionals, we're used to talking to each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20374)|
| 5:39:39| other and working through problems together. We're not used to the sunshine laws and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20379)|
| 5:39:45| requirements of a governmental board. So it kept us from even being able to discuss who might bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20385)|
| 5:39:52| something up to the board. So the concern was if we didn't know what each person was doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20392)|
| 5:40:00| and in my case, it was like, well, we've got to start working on some of this. And I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20400)|
| 5:40:06| because I've been in the community a long time, know a fair number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20406)|
| 5:40:09| had people who said when I would question, hey, let's work on something, they said, here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20409)|
| 5:40:14| let me help you with this. Here's some statistics. Here's some legal language to help you try to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20414)|
| 5:40:20| this together. I didn't know how to work with the attorney we had assigned to us initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20420)|
| 5:40:24| I didn't know the role that he might have in putting that together. So we have all kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20424)|
| 5:40:31| grown into this role of trying to figure out how to act and how to operate. So yes, I put that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20431)|
| 5:40:40| together with help from some people who volunteered and put that out there. We didn't, and the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20440)|
| 5:40:46| for us was we didn't get to see it until that day, that night. So we didn't even have agendas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20446)|
| 5:40:53| presented the information ahead of time for us even to consider. So we have grown now over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20453)|
| 5:40:59| time where we have Mr. Sanders as the attorney who has been very helpful in trying to guide us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20459)|
| 5:41:06| We have set rules for establishing an agenda so we can all see what is being proposed by Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20466)|
| 5:41:14| at noon. So things have progressed. But yes, I did that on my own, and I did it out of not knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20474)|
| 5:41:21| how else to get something set up. Okay, and then next time you'll let the law department have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20481)|
| 5:41:28| than five minutes notice to review the document. Totally. We didn't have the guidance or the knowledge to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20488)|
| 5:41:35| how to go forward. Okay, and then in your last meeting that everybody watched, you were very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20495)|
| 5:41:41| distressed with what was going on on Cumberland Avenue. In fact, you said, and it was put, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20501)|
| 5:41:47| I was, to put it mildly, not happy with what I saw. Well, and again, this was in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20507)|
| 5:41:55| of Knoxville. You know, it kind of would have been nice if after you'd left the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20515)|
| 5:42:01| you'd gone out to your own neighborhood and looked to see what Water of Wine is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20521)|
| 5:42:06| or Bullfeathers is doing. These are entities that are struggling just like everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20526)|
| 5:42:11| but they're following the rules and the regulations by the letter of the law, and yet it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20531)|
| 5:42:18| makes it look like they're all lumped into this one basket. So it would have been nice if you'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20538)|
| 5:42:24| just come to your own community and said, hey, I saw what was going downtown, but guess what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20544)|
| 5:42:28| going out here? They're following the rules and regulations, and they should be commended for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20548)|
| 5:42:34| But that didn't happen again. There was no positive reinforcement of what others in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20554)|
| 5:42:40| community are doing, and so I was very disappointed with that. Would one of you like to address the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20560)|
| 5:42:50| you know, one of the epicenters for the state of Tennessee was Davidson County or Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20570)|
| 5:42:56| okay? The two closest bedroom communities to Nashville, Williamson and Rutherford County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20576)|
| 5:43:02| have just eliminated their mask mandate. So what do they know that we don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20582)|
| 5:43:11| I'm going to let Dr. Buchanan start because I don't have direct knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20591)|
| 5:43:17| And one of those is also a college town, by the way. Excuse me, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20597)|
| 5:43:22| I don't have any knowledge of Rutherford County. My understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20602)|
| 5:43:27| that Williamson County's decision was not made based on data or information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20607)|
| 5:43:32| that was about COVID. It was more of a, I don't know, I'm not sure who made the decision, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20612)|
| 5:43:37| wasn't an evidence-based or data-based decision. You mentioned Davidson County. Davidson County's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20617)|
| 5:43:45| effectively reduced their cases by using public health regulations and a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20625)|
| 5:43:53| Okay. I guess the other thing that I wanted to bring up, and Commissioner Smith kind of hit on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20633)|
| 5:44:03| it, it seems like we're trying to control one age group of our population, but yet it's affecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20643)|
| 5:44:10| the whole population in Knox County. And I hope you have an understanding of what kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20650)|
| 5:44:18| financial impact this has been to the businesses in our county. We heard one individual at Public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20658)|

| 5:44:32| operate properly. And I guess the other thing that bothers me too is when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20672)|
| 5:44:42| we have received emails this past week, all of us, to a record I've never seen before. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20682)|
| 5:44:49| texting, the phone calls, everything. I mean, I don't think there's been, and Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20689)|
| 5:44:53| you've been around a long time, I don't think there's anything that even pales in comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20693)|
| 5:44:57| But I guess the other thing that bothered me is the folks that have a medical condition in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20697)|
| 5:45:03| county that are being harassed because of it. And I had a very heartfelt email from a citizen whose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20703)|

| 5:45:21| by the the maskers or whatever you want to call them. And never even bothered to even consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20721)|
| 5:45:27| that he may have a condition to where he can't wear a mask. So this issue has really divided our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20727)|
| 5:45:34| county. And I hope you can appreciate also, just like I said earlier, the financial impact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20734)|
| 5:45:40| this is having on Knox County. I do, sir. I think we all in the Board of Health have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20740)|
| 5:45:46| You know, the time of 11 p.m. closes very few businesses in our county. I do know a fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20746)|

| 5:46:00| And I know that it's been difficult. But by what we've done, we have been able to allow them to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20760)|
| 5:46:07| open in this environment, wearing masks, social distancing, at least being open. We're not like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20767)|
| 5:46:13| New York City and other jurisdictions that have closed things down. And we, as the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20773)|
| 5:46:20| never did any of that. The only thing we've done in this regard is this 11 p.m. closing that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20780)|
| 5:46:26| done recently and then before that, the curfew. But we did not do what the Tennessee Pledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20786)|
| 5:46:33| mandated. We, as the Board of Health, did not mandate anything before July. So I want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20793)|
| 5:46:39| that clear. And then also, some of those businesses listed did not close because of COVID. I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20799)|
| 5:46:45| personally because of knowing the business owners. Other factors came into play. So you need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20805)|
| 5:46:51| all the information and understand, yes, COVID is a piece of this. It is not the only piece in what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20811)|
| 5:46:58| going on in our business community. Okay, and final comment. Do either one of you know what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20818)|

| 5:47:26| the Board of Health has done since day one. Or it will be 2 a.m. and we will still be talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20846)|

| 5:47:52| We had 42 people come in here tonight and talk to us about their feelings. Some things I noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20872)|

| 5:48:48| Is there any way that you can get both sides to work together to come to a compromise where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20928)|
| 5:48:56| can both agree to talk about this issue about the COVID virus to where we say yes, it does work this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20936)|
| 5:49:06| way or no, it doesn't work this way. You know, we first heard social distancing and then we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20946)|
| 5:49:12| about the mask. Then we heard about it, then you have to vote social distance and the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20952)|

| 5:49:39| So if we don't test, you know, you talk about tests, you have to wait, the state says 10 days, we say 14 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20979)|
| 5:49:48| before you're free to let go again. So how can we from this point on start working with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20988)|
| 5:49:57| that comes out here that says they're afraid to talk because they're afraid that the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=20997)|
| 5:50:00| department will, they'll bring retribution back to them for something that they're afraid to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21000)|
| 5:50:06| Well, they'll bring retribution back to them for saying stuff. Now that's how they feel. You've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21006)|
| 5:50:11| heard them say that. I'm not saying that because of me and I'm upset that people feel that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21011)|
| 5:50:18| have to be afraid of their government. But there's some way we've got to talk amongst ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21018)|
| 5:50:24| and not just over this resolution to get this, our county back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21024)|
| 5:50:31| And because it started around this, how can we work to get them back together? Do you know of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21031)|
| 5:50:36| any way that we could get them back together? I'm going to see if Dr. Buchanan wants to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21036)|
| 5:50:40| because a lot of that is in her purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21040)|
| 5:50:46| So the way we get our community back together is for our leaders to lead by example and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21046)|
| 5:50:57| come together and demonstrate that they can work together to solve these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21057)|
| 5:51:08| The board of health has listened to the public and has representation. We're not all the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21068)|
| 5:51:15| We have similar backgrounds. We have similar training, but we certainly aren't all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21075)|
| 5:51:21| same political persuasion. I'm guessing. I don't know for sure, but I'm guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21081)|
| 5:51:26| And we're able to sit together, talk through things, and make decisions based on evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21086)|
| 5:51:30| and data. And we are listening to the community. We've made some compromises. We've made some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21090)|
| 5:51:36| changes. And I'm very proud of our board. So I think that leaders have to lead by example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21096)|
| 5:51:43| and come together and show people that mask wearing and COVID-19 are not partisan issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21103)|
| 5:51:52| They are not political issues. These decisions that need to be made are not political decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21112)|
| 5:51:57| They impact our community greatly, but they're public health decisions and the decisions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21117)|
| 5:52:03| need to be made by public health professionals who have the expertise. So I think that's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21123)|
| 5:52:10| for everybody to understand, but it's not a partisan or political decision. It's a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21130)|
| 5:52:16| that needs to be made to protect the entire community. Commissioner Schoonmaker talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21136)|
| 5:52:20| the entire community. These efforts protect everybody in our community. It doesn't matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21140)|
| 5:52:27| where they live in Knox County. Wearing a mask protects people from getting COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21147)|
| 5:52:32| And if we need to come together as leaders and follow the five core actions and put those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21152)|
| 5:52:40| in place as regular practice, then we'll be able to see our numbers come down. Commissioner Bussley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21160)|
| 5:52:46| Quiet, please. You're talking about lead by example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21166)|
| 5:52:55| Okay. I wear this mask not because I'm forced to wear it. It's because I wear it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21175)|
| 5:53:03| I respect other people around me that I could give them something that they don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21183)|
| 5:53:09| But now when I walk out and I get outside this place, I'm taking it off now because I can't talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21189)|
| 5:53:16| through this thing. But when I'm out and I'm out by myself, I take it off. If I'm not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21196)|
| 5:53:25| we're close 10 to 15 feet from anybody, I take it off if I'm outside. We talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21205)|
| 5:53:32| quarantine people in houses like we're doing right now. I don't know if this is recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21212)|
| 5:53:37| area in here and somebody has COVID that it would come back through and affect me now with my mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21217)|
| 5:53:42| off. I don't know these things. I don't know what I don't know. But I expect people to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21222)|
| 5:53:50| lead the people back instead of demanding that they do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21230)|
| 5:53:56| Quiet, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21236)|
| 5:53:58| So again, how can we do that? And I'm not getting angry or anything like that. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21238)|
| 5:54:05| not trying to get you a gotcha. But I talk to people all the time in my district and let them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21245)|
| 5:54:11| vent to me. And the other thing that I hated tonight, too, that was really something is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21251)|
| 5:54:17| you were asking what their address was when we were talking to them. And a lot of them said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21257)|
| 5:54:22| I don't want to give my address. I'm afraid. But on my card, I give them my home phone number and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21262)|
| 5:54:28| my address because I represent those people. And those people are angry. And they asked me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21268)|
| 5:54:34| to represent them on this dais for their thoughts and what they need. And with me being elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21274)|
| 5:54:44| I'm listening to what they're saying. And it's not good. So how from this point on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21284)|
| 5:54:50| from this point on, can we give them the confidence that we're not taking away their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21290)|
| 5:54:54| freedoms and we're not taking away their rights to make decisions? I go to a doctor on a regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21294)|
| 5:55:01| basis and they tell me what to do. And sometimes they tell me to lose weight. And I don't listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21301)|
| 5:55:05| to them on that part. But I do listen to them on my other health parts. And that's just the way I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21305)|
| 5:55:11| am. You know, sometimes I can take a suggestion, but don't follow it. So but how can we encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21311)|
| 5:55:19| instead of demanding them to do things and to respect one another and not be talking against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21319)|
| 5:55:26| each other? So I'm leaving that in your field because it seems like it started in the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21326)|
| 5:55:31| department saying this is a mandate right now. And I think we should have led them to the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21331)|
| 5:55:36| to make them on their own instead of demanding. And when you do that, these Tennessee people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21336)|
| 5:55:42| this certain thing. If I come out and tell you to do something, you're going to back up and tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21342)|
| 5:55:48| no way. So it's just our human nature. How do we and how are we going to do that from now on out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21348)|
| 5:55:54| to get them to feel that we're not taking those freedoms away? Sir, the thing I would just say is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21354)|
| 5:56:00| we are trying as the Knox County Board of Health to achieve something that is for the common good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21360)|
| 5:56:10| which is public health. Public health is not an individual thing. It is all of us. And by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21370)|
| 5:56:17| all of us doing certain things that help all of us, such as wearing the mask. And again, remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21377)|
| 5:56:25| this whole virus is something new. Remember, it's called the novel coronavirus. It operates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21385)|
| 5:56:31| differently. It is still changing. The information is changing and will continue to change. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21391)|
| 5:56:38| we just need to look at the whole community and come together and do those things together to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21398)|
| 5:56:45| care for each other. So wear your mask. Wash your hands. Please, please stay apart. Social distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21405)|
| 5:56:53| If you're sick, don't go to work. Don't go out and congregate with people. You know, these sorts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21413)|
| 5:57:00| of things will help. We have, unfortunately, some people who just even when we asked that from March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21420)|
| 5:57:07| April, May, June, they couldn't do it. We observed that in our community. I observed it. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21427)|
| 5:57:14| where our Board of Health said we need to do something a bit more. And wearing mask doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21434)|
| 5:57:21| take away your liberty, I don't feel, or your freedom. It's if other things happen that are more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21441)|
| 5:57:28| onerous that can do that. And we don't ever want to get near those other types of things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21448)|
| 5:57:33| we have seen in some other areas, I think, of the country where it has been a lot more regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21453)|
| 5:57:39| a lot more closing, a lot lengthier closing. And the way we can do that is by caring for each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21459)|
| 5:57:45| and doing what we can to knock this virus down. So the sooner we do that and come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21465)|
| 5:57:52| the sooner it'll be behind us. Otherwise, you're going to see higher numbers, higher hospitalizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21472)|
| 5:57:59| more deaths, and those numbers could get quite high if we don't act quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21479)|
| 5:58:08| So that's just what has to be said this time of year as the flu is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21488)|
| 5:58:12| Before I pass the baton to Commissioner Beeler, I just want to remind everybody that's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21492)|
| 5:58:18| this body and everyone that's talking right now sat through four hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21498)|
| 5:58:23| listening very patiently and very quietly and very respectfully to everything you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21503)|
| 5:58:28| Please show the same courtesy. Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21508)|
| 5:58:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to try to speak just to the resolution that is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21511)|
| 5:58:39| I want to say a quick word to Colonel O'Brien and Dr. Buchanan. I definitely echo the words of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21519)|
| 5:58:46| many of my colleagues. Thank you for your service. I completely agree with your comments, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21526)|
| 5:58:51| that the health board is simply doing what you were tasked to do. And we all learned a lot about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21531)|
| 5:58:58| that in the past six months. Let me say that, you know, my position on this resolution is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21538)|
| 5:59:07| be driven by just a fundamental belief I have, and that is that appointed boards should not create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21547)|
| 5:59:12| law or mandates or ordinances or anything like that. And I know some disagree with that. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21552)|
| 5:59:19| know, I know Dr. Roberts made some good points and articulated his points very well. He talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21559)|
| 5:59:25| about how there are agencies in the federal government, for instance, the Department of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21565)|
| 5:59:29| Interior, they may enact regulations and mandates with the national parks and so forth. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21569)|
| 5:59:36| I think many of us would agree that the federal government has ballooned into a monstrosity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21576)|
| 5:59:42| that not only would shock our founding fathers, but also that local governments or hardly anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21582)|
| 5:59:47| else can even be compared to. So we're talking about local government. You know, although that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21587)|
| 5:59:54| a core belief of mine, I believe that law should only be created by the legislative branch or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21594)|
| 5:59:58| people. But based on the laws that are on the books right now, the state of Tennessee disagrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21598)|
| 6:00:06| when it comes to boards of health. And we're here tonight because back in the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21606)|
| 6:00:16| most of us who even knew that there was such a thing as a board of health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21616)|
| 6:00:21| felt that those boards of health existed to provide a measure of oversight and fiduciary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21621)|
| 6:00:25| oversight over the health department and to act as an advisory board to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21625)|
| 6:00:30| Well, we all learned, or many of us learned, that health boards actually have been given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21630)|
| 6:00:37| much broader authority by the state, and in many ways, kind of unlimited authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21637)|
| 6:00:43| And that set off some alarm bells and red flags in a lot of people as a matter of principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21643)|
| 6:00:50| And so, you know, I say that to say that I can support this resolution. Now, I'll qualify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21650)|
| 6:00:58| with this. I'm a strict constructionist when it comes to the Constitution and to the rule of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21658)|
| 6:01:05| And under the rule of law, a county is a subdivision of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21665)|
| 6:01:09| Counties exist because the state that they are in says they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21669)|
| 6:01:14| Counties are not sovereign. States are sovereign, or at least they were supposed to be when it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21674)|
| 6:01:21| started. And so a county cannot make a law that conflicts with state law. However, this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21681)|
| 6:01:30| in its final form does express desire and intent, not creating a law or a mandate. And so I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21690)|
| 6:01:37| support the resolution as it's written because of those principles. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21697)|
| 6:01:41| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler. Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21701)|
| 6:01:44| Thank you, Chairman. Man, Richie Beeler, you're all right. That was good stuff. I ain't gonna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21704)|
| 6:01:50| lie. I'm impressed. I feel the same way you do, brother. But I feel a little bit more. I'm a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21710)|
| 6:01:56| little bit more passionate because, Dr. O'Brien, I've never had the pleasure of meeting you, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21716)|
| 6:02:00| I really do appreciate everything you're doing, but I hear a whole lot of I and not a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21720)|
| 6:02:04| of we. And the direction that I want to see the Board of Health go is the direction that I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21724)|
| 6:02:12| like my constituents want as well. And while I do appreciate you, I heard a lot of infringing upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21732)|
| 6:02:20| my freedoms and things of that nature tonight, a lot of data. And I'll be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21740)|
| 6:02:26| other than the CDC and some other areas, I don't even really know where you guys are pulling your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21746)|
| 6:02:29| data from. I heard Commissioner Smith talk about taking a stance on underage consumption. I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21749)|
| 6:02:36| heard a lot of different stances. But whenever I met with Director Book, Law Director Book, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21756)|
| 6:02:44| I started talking to him about a resolution that I wanted to craft that I felt like would find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21764)|
| 6:02:52| medium ground. And boy, I've got some of the nastiest, most hateful emails and phone calls ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21772)|
| 6:02:59| and I've come to the realization there's not a medium ground. It doesn't exist anymore. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21779)|
| 6:03:04| either one side or the other. And that scares me sometimes. I feel like with this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21784)|
| 6:03:11| it's the best that we can structure to put out there. But whenever I'm hearing everybody talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21791)|
| 6:03:20| I have a couple questions. After the state emergencies are over, Director Book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21800)|
| 6:03:25| what happens to the Board of Health's powers? The Board of Health powers will still exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21805)|
| 6:03:29| Exactly. If the Board of Health decided that sugary soft drinks weren't good for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21809)|
| 6:03:35| could they mandate that you can't buy sugary soft drinks in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21815)|
| 6:03:39| Let me read to you. So as I have been misunderstood by the press and one or two commissioners on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21819)|
| 6:03:45| I said at the last meeting, so I'm just going to read from the statute, okay? Thank you, Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21825)|
| 6:03:50| The question was if, I guess you're referring to what they did up in New York City where they banned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21830)|
| 6:03:56| the sugar drinks. So I'll answer that by giving you from the statute so there will not be any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21836)|
| 6:04:03| misunderstanding. The Board of Health under the statute can adopt rules and regulations as may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21843)|
| 6:04:12| be necessary or appropriate to protect the general health and safety of the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21852)|
| 6:04:20| of the county, period. They have that broad, broad authority. There's no limitation on that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21860)|
| 6:04:27| And as Commissioner Beeler pointed out, there's no answerability. The federal agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21867)|
| 6:04:35| when they do a regulation, they are required to follow the Administrative Procedures Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21875)|
| 6:04:41| They need to publish that to the public. The public gets a chance to put in their say-so on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21881)|
| 6:04:48| it before that regulation ever becomes law. And that agency, whether it be the FDA or whatever it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21888)|
| 6:04:57| is, has a head who is appointed by the Executive, the President of the United States, and is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21897)|
| 6:05:04| answerable to that. So there is answerability. It's not just the legislature set this up, we live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21904)|
| 6:05:11| with it, we can't change that law, but that's the broad, broad, broad power to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21911)|
| 6:05:17| Commissioner. Thank you, sir. With that being said, I've looked over this and basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21917)|
| 6:05:27| there's no limitation on the power of the Board of Health as long as they say that it's the safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21927)|
| 6:05:33| Is that correct? In their opinion, if they can do adopt rules and regulations as may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21933)|
| 6:05:42| necessary or appropriate to protect the general health and safety of the citizens, that's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21942)|
| 6:05:49| Thank you, sir. Commissioner Ward. I just had a follow-up on what Commissioner Biggs asked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21949)|
| 6:05:58| make me think of another question along the same lines. At last commission, we had a lady speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21958)|
| 6:06:04| very passionately about the gun murder rate we've been having in East Knoxville. Could the Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21964)|
| 6:06:10| in theory, say that we have a gun problem and banned guns to some degree? As broad as this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21970)|
| 6:06:18| written, and if you follow what people across the country are doing where they're saying guns are a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21978)|
| 6:06:24| safety hazard and they want to cut down the limitation on guns and all of that, it's arguable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21984)|
| 6:06:32| that what I just read is something that would fall within the province of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21992)|
| 6:06:38| I'm coming over to you, Commissioner Smith, but I'm going through the rounds the best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=21998)|
| 6:06:43| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22003)|
| 6:06:47| Thank you. This resolution is certainly written with compromise in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22007)|
| 6:07:03| However, I've come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22023)|
| 6:07:09| process this and believe that it changes nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22029)|
| 6:07:16| It changes nothing. It merely says what we wish, what we feel, but it in no way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22036)|
| 6:07:26| as of today, changes anything that's going on with our Board of Health. With that in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22046)|
| 6:07:35| I'd like to make a substitute motion, and if someone would please give me a second on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22055)|
| 6:07:42| so I could finish my thoughts, I'd like to propose that we postpone this indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22062)|
| 6:07:51| There's a substitute motion on the table. Is there a second for the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22071)|
| 6:07:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22076)|
| 6:07:56| And the substitute motion to repeat is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22076)|
| 6:08:00| To postpone indefinitely the vote on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22080)|
| 6:08:04| I think you have to take...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22084)|
| 6:08:05| That'd be the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22085)|
| 6:08:07| That would be to table the motion completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22087)|
| 6:08:10| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22090)|
| 6:08:13| Postpone indefinitely, it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22093)|
| 6:08:16| Is that a motion that can be taken, or is it a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22096)|
| 6:08:21| Is that a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22101)|
| 6:08:21| I don't believe you can postpone indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22101)|
| 6:08:24| I don't think that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22104)|
| 6:08:25| You can table and move it to the next meeting, but you've got to have a time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22105)|
| 6:08:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22110)|
| 6:08:30| Let me look it up in Roberts, because it's not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22110)|
| 6:08:32| Let's double check that before we ask for the second, but I think you have to either put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22112)|
| 6:08:36| time period on it, or you have to make a motion to take action, which would be to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22116)|
| 6:08:43| to defer, to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22123)|
| 6:08:48| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22128)|
| 6:08:49| Or to postpone indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22129)|
| 6:08:51| Yeah, but I think you can't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22131)|
| 6:08:53| We'll double check here in a second, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22133)|
| 6:08:55| Well, while you're looking it up, I will just state that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22135)|
| 6:09:01| I'm not suggesting that this board should not take some action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22141)|
| 6:09:04| but if we're going to take some action through resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22144)|
| 6:09:08| we need to take some action that's going to change something and make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22148)|
| 6:09:14| This merely states what we think and what we wish would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22154)|
| 6:09:20| Now, we've got information here about an ordinance, and perhaps someone on this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22160)|
| 6:09:27| might want to rewrite a resolution to dissolve the ordinance so that we can dissolve the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22167)|
| 6:09:36| of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22176)|
| 6:09:36| That's going down a road where what we do, it will, in fact, make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22176)|
| 6:09:42| This resolution, as it stands, changes nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22182)|
| 6:09:47| Changes nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22187)|
| 6:09:48| According to my sheet, there is a Robert's Rules of Order ability to postpone indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22188)|
| 6:09:55| By asking to move to postpone the question indefinitely, it would be a majority vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22195)|
| 6:10:01| and it says the matter can come up again at the first meeting of the next session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22201)|
| 6:10:06| If you have not defined a session in your local rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22206)|
| 6:10:08| I can come up with the next regular session, so we do have that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22208)|
| 6:10:12| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22212)|
| 6:10:14| The Robert's Rules in Section 11 under Roman Numeral 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22214)|
| 6:10:22| says to postpone indefinitely is a motion that the Assembly decline to take a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22222)|
| 6:10:28| on the main question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22228)|
| 6:10:29| Its adoption kills the main motion for the duration of the session and avoids a direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22229)|
| 6:10:35| vote on the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22235)|
| 6:10:37| It is useful in disposing of a badly chosen main motion that cannot be either adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22237)|
| 6:10:42| or expressly rejected without possibly undesirable circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22242)|
| 6:10:48| That's straight from Robert's Rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22248)|
| 6:10:51| That's Section...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22251)|
| 6:10:54| Can I see that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22254)|
| 6:10:56| Chapter 6, Section 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22256)|
| 6:10:59| So is that a yes or a no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22259)|
| 6:11:14| It's a substitute motion, so you can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22274)|
| 6:11:17| So it is an appropriate...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22277)|
| 6:11:18| It is an appropriate motion, yes, if you receive a second from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22278)|
| 6:11:22| But would it just postpone until...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22282)|
| 6:11:24| It can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22284)|
| 6:11:25| It could be brought up the next...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22285)|
| 6:11:26| It could be brought up in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22286)|
| 6:11:28| It is not required to be brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22288)|
| 6:11:30| It doesn't defer it automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22290)|
| 6:11:32| Somebody could refile a motion or refile something completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22292)|

| 6:12:38| well, we don't want them to go to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22358)|
| 6:12:39| We want the officer to hand them a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22359)|
| 6:12:45| What's going to be next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22365)|
| 6:12:48| If there's a vaccine comes out, I only have one kidney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22368)|

| 6:13:02| That's where we're leading into a lot of things that I don't agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22382)|
| 6:13:09| I understand where you're going, where you want us to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22389)|

| 6:13:18| The hate that has been developed in the emails and the phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22398)|
| 6:13:25| and the people sitting up there and the people sitting down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22405)|
| 6:13:29| the Facebook, the socials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22409)|
| 6:13:31| We've crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22411)|
| 6:13:33| I hope we've not crossed that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22413)|
| 6:13:35| But we crossed that line in July when this board said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22415)|
| 6:13:42| it's a Class C misdemeanor if you don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22422)|
| 6:13:47| That's my problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22427)|
| 6:13:48| My problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22428)|
| 6:13:49| I will not, I will support this resolution because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22429)|
| 6:13:56| I can see it going somewhere else besides this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22436)|
| 6:14:00| And I don't see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22440)|
| 6:14:04| I don't know if our state legislatures will pick it up and carry it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22444)|
| 6:14:08| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22448)|
| 6:14:10| To me, it may be one of the points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22450)|
| 6:14:12| or maybe at the place where our state legislature says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22452)|
| 6:14:16| hey, United States County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22456)|

| 6:14:27| I heard John mention that he had talked to the Charlie Curtis at T.C. S.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22467)|
| 6:14:34| And this resolution is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22474)|
| 6:14:36| We've been threatened that we're going to be sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22476)|
| 6:14:39| And if you don't, we're going to be sued if we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22479)|
| 6:14:41| We're going to be sued if we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22481)|
| 6:14:43| So if we are, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22483)|
| 6:14:45| Okay, that's just going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22485)|
| 6:14:47| that's just lawyers wanting to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22487)|
| 6:14:50| I mean, that's just the way, that's just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22490)|
| 6:14:53| The taxpayers are going to lose one way or the other here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22493)|
| 6:14:57| I'm not going to be able to support, I will support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22497)|
| 6:15:01| but I'm not going to be able to support a board that will make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22501)|
| 6:15:06| me a classy Mr. Meaner person because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22506)|

| 6:15:20| but I'll take it off and there'll be somebody who'll say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22520)|
| 6:15:22| well, Commissioner Daley wasn't wearing his mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22522)|

| 6:15:44| I don't get in somebody's face and say that you need to be wearing a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22544)|
| 6:15:47| because I don't, I don't know their, their situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22547)|
| 6:15:52| We do not have the golden rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22552)|
| 6:15:56| If we would treat each other the way that you wanted to be treated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22556)|
| 6:16:02| we would be a whole lot better off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22562)|
| 6:16:03| It's just, it's back to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22563)|
| 6:16:05| I'm afraid this country is so divided now that the hate is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22565)|
| 6:16:12| And is, is the politicians part of the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22572)|
| 6:16:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22576)|
| 6:16:17| Is the news media the bigger problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22577)|
| 6:16:20| Probably, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22580)|
| 6:16:23| Are we going to fix it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22583)|
| 6:16:24| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22584)|
| 6:16:26| Are we going to fix it tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22586)|

| 6:16:29| We ain't going to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22589)|
| 6:16:31| But it's not going to change the people up in the balcony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22591)|
| 6:16:36| booing and being disrespectful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22596)|
| 6:16:39| and the people down here booing or being disrespectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22599)|
| 6:16:42| Disrespect gets you nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22602)|
| 6:16:45| Threatening me gets you nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22605)|
| 6:16:48| Show me respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22608)|

| 6:16:54| So I said all that to say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22614)|
| 6:16:58| man, if I could wave the magic wand and make us all one happy family, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22618)|
| 6:17:02| But that's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22622)|
| 6:17:05| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22625)|
| 6:17:06| I'm going to go, everybody just keep this in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22626)|

| 6:17:18| I'm going to ask, I'm going to weigh in here before I talk to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22638)|
| 6:17:22| pass it on to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22642)|
| 6:17:24| I think the one thing that has been lost in this conversation tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22644)|
| 6:17:28| and about this particular resolution is something I briefly mentioned last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22648)|
| 6:17:32| And I'm speaking as seat 10 on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22652)|
| 6:17:36| which is item number three in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22656)|
| 6:17:39| It says, it is our intent through the commission to express the desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22659)|
| 6:17:42| that the citizens should not suffer criminal sanctions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22662)|
| 6:17:45| for failure to abide orders of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22665)|
| 6:17:49| Take COVID out of it for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22669)|
| 6:17:52| For a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22672)|
| 6:17:55| The Board of Health was established by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22675)|
| 6:17:58| And we've said many times, I don't think anybody's disagreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22678)|
| 6:18:01| that nothing will change tonight based upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22681)|
| 6:18:04| It was established by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22684)|
| 6:18:06| It was put under the precedence of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22686)|
| 6:18:08| It was structured by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22688)|
| 6:18:09| We adopted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22689)|
| 6:18:11| It is a state law function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22691)|
| 6:18:13| It can only be changed by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22693)|
| 6:18:16| There's almost nobody on this dais tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22696)|
| 6:18:20| that I haven't heard at some point in their time or my time here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22700)|

| 6:18:30| We don't get to pick and choose what laws we like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22710)|
| 6:18:32| and what laws we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22712)|
| 6:18:35| We change those if we decide we want to change the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22715)|
| 6:18:38| but we don't ignore them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22718)|
| 6:18:40| And take COVID out of it for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22720)|
| 6:18:42| Item number three in this resolution says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22722)|
| 6:18:46| eh, we don't intend to want to sanction anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22726)|
| 6:18:52| for something that is legal and lawful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22732)|
| 6:18:55| by a board that is governed by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22735)|
| 6:18:58| that is established by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22738)|
| 6:19:00| So take COVID out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22740)|
| 6:19:02| A resolution comes up in a few months that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22742)|
| 6:19:05| we don't intend to prosecute anybody for DUI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22745)|
| 6:19:09| We don't think it's an issue anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22749)|
| 6:19:12| Doesn't matter what the laws say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22752)|
| 6:19:15| Doesn't matter what anything says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22755)|
| 6:19:17| We just, we don't think it's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22757)|
| 6:19:19| So we don't really want to prosecute anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22759)|
| 6:19:22| Take that out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22762)|
| 6:19:23| Another resolution comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22763)|
| 6:19:25| We don't intend to prosecute anybody for child abuse, for theft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22765)|
| 6:19:31| That's not a big issue anymore in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22771)|
| 6:19:35| By adopting this tonight, we're setting a precedence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22775)|
| 6:19:37| that we are saying that we express the desire to not follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22777)|
| 6:19:44| Regardless if you like it or you don't, we're a nation of laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22784)|
| 6:19:48| We have federal laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22788)|
| 6:19:49| We have state laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22789)|
| 6:19:50| We have local ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22790)|
| 6:19:52| If you want to change this, there's only really two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22792)|
| 6:19:55| One, you change the state law, which would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22795)|
| 6:19:58| from what I'm understanding, is the only state in the entire country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22798)|
| 6:20:01| that would do it differently than everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22801)|
| 6:20:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22804)|
| 6:20:05| So maybe we're smarter in Tennessee than everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22805)|
| 6:20:07| Maybe we have a different way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22807)|
| 6:20:08| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22808)|
| 6:20:09| But you do it by state law, or you put an ordinance in it to have no Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22809)|
| 6:20:14| and have nobody looking after public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22814)|
| 6:20:16| except for our director and the team at the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22816)|
| 6:20:19| So there's two options, but neither of those two options are before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22819)|
| 6:20:23| And I think that my opinion is, if you put this precedence down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22823)|
| 6:20:27| you're saying now we're picking and choosing which ones we want to follow and not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22827)|
| 6:20:31| because it's our desire to think about following these, but not the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22831)|
| 6:20:35| And I think that's a terrible precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22835)|
| 6:20:37| Pass it to Commissioner Schaffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22837)|
| 6:20:39| Commissioner Schaffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22839)|
| 6:20:42| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22842)|
| 6:20:44| I do believe that the Board of Health said it was not their intention to have people arrested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22844)|
| 6:20:48| was it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22848)|
| 6:20:50| No, not our intention at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22850)|
| 6:20:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22853)|
| 6:20:54| But we do not establish state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22854)|
| 6:20:57| When we do our regulations, we make a regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22857)|
| 6:21:00| It's the state law behind it that states such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22860)|
| 6:21:04| So we're not the ones stating such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22864)|
| 6:21:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22867)|
| 6:21:08| Commissioner Smith, if I may, I just want to remind everybody listening that no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22868)|
| 6:21:15| has been fined, cited, arrested for not wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22875)|
| 6:21:20| That hasn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22880)|
| 6:21:21| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22881)|
| 6:21:21| Heard about business people and others chiding people for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22881)|
| 6:21:24| but no legal action has been taken for somebody not wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22884)|
| 6:21:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22891)|
| 6:21:32| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22892)|
| 6:21:34| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22894)|
| 6:21:35| That needs to be heard, though, because some people don't think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22895)|
| 6:21:40| Getting a lot of emails and people think one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22900)|
| 6:21:44| but the reality is nobody, that has not happened to one person in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22904)|
| 6:21:49| I just want to reiterate what Dr. Buchanan said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22909)|
| 6:21:51| Is that due to Mayor Buchanan and Chief Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22911)|
| 6:21:54| Commissioner Smith has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22914)|
| 6:21:57| I want to, first of all, no one's suggesting that the Board of Health should be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22917)|
| 6:22:02| I don't think anybody has said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22922)|
| 6:22:07| I do know that there are six counties that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22927)|
| 6:22:10| their own power when it comes to the Health Department or the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22930)|
| 6:22:14| Those are Shelby, Hamilton, Knox, Davison, Madison, and Sullivan, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22934)|
| 6:22:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22939)|
| 6:22:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22941)|
| 6:22:21| The other 89 counties are governed by the Commissioner of Health through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22941)|
| 6:22:27| the governor of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22947)|
| 6:22:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22950)|
| 6:22:33| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22953)|
| 6:22:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22955)|
| 6:22:35| Do we know how these other six counties operate since we're talking about structure here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22955)|
| 6:22:42| I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22962)|
| 6:22:46| we don't have to have a Board of Health to comply with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22966)|
| 6:22:50| We can have a Board of Advisories that advise our senior health official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22970)|
| 6:22:56| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22976)|
| 6:22:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22978)|
| 6:22:58| Do we know how Shelby operates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22978)|
| 6:23:00| Do they operate with a Board of Health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22980)|
| 6:23:04| If I may, I can answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22984)|
| 6:23:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22988)|
| 6:23:09| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22989)|
| 6:23:11| Davison, Shelby, Hamilton, Jackson, Madison, and Sullivan all have Boards of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22991)|
| 6:23:17| They're all slightly different based on their local ordinance as to how they operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=22997)|
| 6:23:22| but they all are established under Tennessee code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23002)|
| 6:23:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23005)|
| 6:23:25| And they all have slightly different functions based on local decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23005)|
| 6:23:32| that are made by the leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23012)|
| 6:23:36| But...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23016)|
| 6:23:38| Do any of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23018)|
| 6:23:39| They all do have Boards of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23019)|
| 6:23:40| and they all have different levels of involvement in COVID-related issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23020)|
| 6:23:45| In most jurisdictions, to be honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23025)|
| 6:23:49| it's either the Director of the Health Department or the Health Officer, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23029)|
| 6:23:55| maybe the Mayor, making decisions about COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23035)|
| 6:23:58| Our Law Director, per the TCA, made the decision and directed us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23038)|
| 6:24:03| and we followed that the Board was the only body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23043)|
| 6:24:06| that had the authority to enact any orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23046)|
| 6:24:11| That was a change at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23051)|
| 6:24:13| I don't remember exactly when that change happened during COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23053)|
| 6:24:18| I'll note that some of the things that people are concerned about actually happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23058)|
| 6:24:23| before the Board of Health was voting on anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23063)|
| 6:24:25| and actually under an order from myself that the Law Director said was my authority at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23065)|
| 6:24:33| and also under executive orders from the Governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23073)|
| 6:24:35| where he was asking us to only have essential services open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23075)|
| 6:24:40| So, just to clarify some of those points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23080)|
| 6:24:43| Okay, but I guess what I was asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23083)|
| 6:24:45| you know, in Davidson, they've had a problem with some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23085)|
| 6:24:51| I don't know all the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23091)|
| 6:24:52| but who has been advising their Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23092)|
| 6:24:55| and has the Board of Health there been able to implement mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23095)|
| 6:25:00| or has that had to go through the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23100)|
| 6:25:01| and how does it follow with these other five counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23101)|
| 6:25:05| So, the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23105)|
| 6:25:10| as I stated, the Health Officer has written the orders in Davidson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23110)|
| 6:25:16| as well as Shelby County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23116)|
| 6:25:18| and I think Hamilton has written a couple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23118)|
| 6:25:21| not many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23121)|
| 6:25:23| So, those have been written by the Health Officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23123)|
| 6:25:26| Shelby County, I mean, Davidson County's Health Officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23126)|
| 6:25:29| I believe, reports to the Health Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23129)|
| 6:25:31| who's appointed by the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23131)|
| 6:25:33| I don't know exactly how they did all of that functionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23133)|
| 6:25:37| to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23137)|
| 6:25:38| but those orders, if you go on the websites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23138)|
| 6:25:40| you can see that those orders came from the Health Officer for that county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23140)|
| 6:25:46| and that's how their legal department has advised them to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23146)|
| 6:25:50| Okay, so, Dr. Buchanan, are you saying that it's your legal advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23150)|
| 6:25:55| that you could make these decisions without the enforcement of the Board of Health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23155)|
| 6:26:01| I'm not trained in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23161)|
| 6:26:04| I follow the direction of our law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23164)|
| 6:26:06| and as I've stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23166)|
| 6:26:09| currently, our law department is stating that the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23169)|
| 6:26:12| is the health policy setting body for the County of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23172)|
| 6:26:17| Okay, thank you, and again, Dr. O'Brien,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23177)|
| 6:26:19| I want to thank you and all your fellow members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23179)|
| 6:26:23| This is not an easy situation for anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23183)|
| 6:26:26| and I appreciate what you all have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23186)|
| 6:26:29| I hope you understand the position that we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23189)|
| 6:26:32| and some of the fears that people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23192)|
| 6:26:36| You know, a lot of people have compared this to a lot of different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23196)|
| 6:26:41| but it is unusual for an appointed body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23201)|
| 6:26:44| to actually have legislative power with no check or balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23204)|
| 6:26:49| Final comments around the horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23209)|
| 6:26:51| Mr. Commissioner Bussler and then Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23211)|
| 6:26:53| did you want to have a final?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23213)|
| 6:26:55| Okay, sorry, I didn't mind to cut you off before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23215)|
| 6:26:57| but Mr. Smith had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23217)|
| 6:27:00| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23220)|
| 6:27:04| I was going to make a motion for a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23224)|
| 6:27:09| but I'm not going to do it since Schoonmaker's got his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23229)|
| 6:27:11| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23231)|
| 6:27:14| Thank you, Mr. Bussler, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23234)|
| 6:27:16| I just want people to understand from my viewpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23236)|
| 6:27:20| that I probably researched this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23240)|
| 6:27:23| more than any other issue that I've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23243)|
| 6:27:27| in five and a half years of serving on the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23247)|
| 6:27:31| I've read a U.S. Supreme Court case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23251)|
| 6:27:34| I've read two state attorney general positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23254)|
| 6:27:38| I've read state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23258)|
| 6:27:41| I've talked to members of the Tennessee Senate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23261)|
| 6:27:43| and I've talked to members of the Tennessee House of Representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23263)|
| 6:27:47| I've talked to the director of the Tennessee County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23267)|
| 6:27:50| Commissioners Association for his advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23270)|
| 6:27:53| So I want you to know the decision that I make tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23273)|
| 6:27:57| I am fully prepared for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23277)|
| 6:27:59| and I pretty much almost read every email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23279)|
| 6:28:02| that's come in from the public and text as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23282)|
| 6:28:07| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23287)|
| 6:28:10| Before we get to, I know Dr. Buchanan did have a statement prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23290)|
| 6:28:15| and if it's okay with you, Commissioner Buss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23295)|
| 6:28:16| I'd like to give her an opportunity before we head towards the final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23296)|
| 6:28:20| Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23300)|
| 6:28:23| Yes, thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23303)|
| 6:28:27| Thank you, commissioners, for your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23307)|
| 6:28:30| to this important question before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23310)|
| 6:28:33| I just want to take a few minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23313)|
| 6:28:34| and I'm not going to read the whole statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23314)|
| 6:28:35| because it is late for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23315)|
| 6:28:38| But you've heard a lot from some members of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23318)|
| 6:28:42| and you've talked with each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23322)|
| 6:28:44| and you've done some research about the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23324)|
| 6:28:48| and about public health in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23328)|
| 6:28:50| But you really haven't heard from me very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23330)|
| 6:28:53| your local public health expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23333)|
| 6:28:56| who has served as your health officer for 14 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23336)|
| 6:29:00| and been at the health department for 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23340)|
| 6:29:02| And I think that for those of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23342)|
| 6:29:06| who've lived in Knox County over that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23346)|
| 6:29:07| you will know that that time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23347)|
| 6:29:10| has not been one of regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23350)|
| 6:29:12| and heavy-handed public health policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23352)|
| 6:29:15| It was insinuated today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23355)|
| 6:29:18| that we can make resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23358)|
| 6:29:19| about sugary drinks and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23359)|
| 6:29:20| and those things have happened in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23360)|
| 6:29:23| But I'm very well aware of where we live in practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23363)|
| 6:29:25| and where we do the things that we do in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23365)|
| 6:29:28| and very aware that East Tennesseans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23368)|
| 6:29:31| aren't thrilled with regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23371)|
| 6:29:33| And that's why we didn't go to a mandate right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23373)|
| 6:29:36| We gave people the opportunity to follow our direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23376)|
| 6:29:39| and do the things that we recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23379)|
| 6:29:41| And our cases just continued to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23381)|
| 6:29:43| And like Dr. O'Brien said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23383)|
| 6:29:45| the board felt they needed to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23385)|
| 6:29:47| I've also heard people insinuate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23387)|
| 6:29:48| or make statements regarding questioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23388)|
| 6:29:52| the expertise of public health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23392)|
| 6:29:54| that Knox County has available to somebody this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23394)|
| 6:29:57| and ask where we get the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23397)|
| 6:29:58| The data comes from my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23398)|
| 6:30:00| The data comes from my very experienced staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23400)|
| 6:30:03| And if you'll bear with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23403)|
| 6:30:04| I'm gonna tell you what that experience is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23404)|
| 6:30:06| In epidemiology, I have 52 years of experience in my staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23406)|
| 6:30:11| some of that with the CDC and the NIH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23411)|
| 6:30:14| Our collective years of case investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23414)|
| 6:30:16| and contact tracing, 131.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23416)|
| 6:30:18| And that doesn't count COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23418)|
| 6:30:20| Collective years of emergency preparedness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23420)|
| 6:30:22| planning and response, 125 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23422)|
| 6:30:25| And we handle an average of 11 outbreaks per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23425)|
| 6:30:28| There are about 7,000 things reported to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23428)|
| 6:30:32| And we investigate each thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23432)|
| 6:30:34| And when necessary, we do contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23434)|
| 6:30:37| And we do the things that we're doing in COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23437)|
| 6:30:39| It's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23439)|
| 6:30:40| We do it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23440)|
| 6:30:41| We do it all year round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23441)|
| 6:30:44| And we've been doing, it's not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23444)|
| 6:30:47| So I think that's important for everybody to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23447)|
| 6:30:49| that we have the expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23449)|
| 6:30:50| and we rely on other experts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23450)|
| 6:30:54| COVID is much bigger than anything we've ever done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23454)|
| 6:30:57| So we rely on the expertise of the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23457)|
| 6:31:00| the CDC and NIH and others as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23460)|
| 6:31:04| I also want to clarify a few things that were said last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23464)|
| 6:31:08| I've already clarified one of them about citing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23468)|
| 6:31:10| for not wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23470)|
| 6:31:12| And masks have not made the situation worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23472)|
| 6:31:16| If you really take time to look at the timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23476)|
| 6:31:18| and the cases, we saw new cases go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23478)|
| 6:31:22| mask mandate went into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23482)|
| 6:31:24| The number of new cases dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23484)|
| 6:31:26| School went back into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23486)|
| 6:31:29| And we've seen our cases go up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23489)|
| 6:31:32| We're hopeful that with people wearing masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23492)|
| 6:31:34| those will come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23494)|
| 6:31:35| We know hospitalizations and deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23495)|
| 6:31:37| will always lag behind cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23497)|
| 6:31:41| And as you heard earlier this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23501)|
| 6:31:44| most Tennesseans do support a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23504)|
| 6:31:49| Also some questions about our ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23509)|
| 6:31:50| to work with businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23510)|
| 6:31:51| We work with businesses as in a regulatory fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23511)|
| 6:31:54| helping them keep Knox County and healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23514)|
| 6:31:57| or year round so that they can operate in a healthy way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23517)|
| 6:32:01| We also work with businesses to help create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23521)|
| 6:32:04| wellness programs for their employees and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23524)|
| 6:32:10| There's been a question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23530)|
| 6:32:11| why are the metropolitan counties different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23531)|
| 6:32:14| And I can only speak to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23534)|
| 6:32:17| We're not governed like the other 89 under the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23537)|
| 6:32:21| Knox County is the third largest county in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23541)|
| 6:32:24| And as such, we have a large population density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23544)|
| 6:32:28| In addition to that, we have the flagship university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23548)|
| 6:32:31| here in our community, which we're happy to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23551)|
| 6:32:34| But that increases our population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23554)|
| 6:32:36| by about 30,000 each fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23556)|
| 6:32:38| And that's important because COVID spreads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23558)|
| 6:32:41| in those situations more easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23561)|
| 6:32:43| So what is at stake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23563)|
| 6:32:46| To date, the COVID narrative has been described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23566)|
| 6:32:49| as public health or the economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23569)|
| 6:32:52| as opposing things like we can't have both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23572)|
| 6:32:56| They're not mutually exclusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23576)|
| 6:32:58| and they both have to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23578)|
| 6:32:59| And I believe the board has considered those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23579)|
| 6:33:02| in their decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23582)|
| 6:33:03| We can't have a healthy economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23583)|
| 6:33:04| without a healthy population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23584)|
| 6:33:06| And there are very real economic ramifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23586)|
| 6:33:10| to rising COVID cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23590)|
| 6:33:12| If we lose the ability to make local decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23592)|
| 6:33:15| based on local data and based on local situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23595)|
| 6:33:17| there is more cases, more hospitalizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23597)|
| 6:33:20| and more deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23600)|
| 6:33:21| Something that will have a very negative impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23601)|
| 6:33:24| on our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23604)|
| 6:33:25| So we can insert politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23605)|
| 6:33:28| and erase public health expertise from this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23608)|
| 6:33:31| but doing that won't erase the virus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23611)|
| 6:33:33| or is very real impact on the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23613)|
| 6:33:36| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23616)|
| 6:33:37| And I'm happy to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23617)|
| 6:33:39| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23619)|
| 6:33:43| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23623)|
| 6:33:44| Dr. Buchanan, I don't have any question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23624)|
| 6:33:46| I sincerely want to thank you too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23626)|
| 6:33:49| and the employees at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23629)|
| 6:33:51| I know how hard you all work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23631)|
| 6:33:53| and how talented you all are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23633)|
| 6:33:55| And don't ever, ever mistaken me questioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23635)|
| 6:34:00| for any disrespect or an unbelief in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23640)|
| 6:34:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23643)|
| 6:34:05| Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23645)|
| 6:34:06| I believe you were going to call for the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23646)|
| 6:34:07| but I also believe that we may be exhausted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23647)|
| 6:34:09| our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23649)|
| 6:34:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23650)|
| 6:34:11| See, I took care of you on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23651)|
| 6:34:16| I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23656)|
| 6:34:20| Is it everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23660)|
| 6:34:21| We can either go towards a call for the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23661)|
| 6:34:23| and actually vote to call for the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23663)|
| 6:34:24| but I do also sort of recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23664)|
| 6:34:27| that everybody's lights are off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23667)|
| 6:34:28| So if it's okay with you, Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23668)|
| 6:34:31| I believe we could just proceed to a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23671)|
| 6:34:33| without calling the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23673)|
| 6:34:34| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23674)|
| 6:34:36| Thank you, Commissioner Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23676)|
| 6:34:38| I'm going to call for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23678)|
| 6:34:39| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23679)|
| 6:34:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23681)|
| 6:34:44| So the motion on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23684)|
| 6:34:46| let me restate the motion on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23686)|
| 6:34:49| is about resolution 907, item number 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23689)|
| 6:34:53| The motion was to approve by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23693)|
| 6:34:57| The motion was seconded by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23697)|
| 6:35:03| Everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23703)|
| 6:35:05| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23705)|
| 6:35:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23707)|

| 6:35:14| That was pretty obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23714)|
| 6:35:16| Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23716)|

| 6:36:11| 8-3, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23771)|

| 6:36:14| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23774)|

| 6:36:26| Item number 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23786)|
| 6:36:27| I do want to talk to the board here or to the commissioners about item number 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23787)|
| 6:36:34| This is appointing the person, the Board of Health citizen representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23794)|
| 6:36:40| It is close to midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23800)|
| 6:36:41| I think a majority of the people who are here that have asked to have their name under consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23801)|
| 6:36:47| are not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23807)|
| 6:36:49| I would be exceptionally surprised if that was the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23809)|
| 6:36:53| I wanted to hear from the fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23813)|
| 6:36:57| My gut tells me this is one that we ought to move back a month to allow those who express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23817)|
| 6:37:02| an interest to actually be in full attendance and not do something at midnight that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23822)|
| 6:37:09| does not give everybody an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23829)|
| 6:37:11| But I want to hear from you all about item number 23 before making any motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23831)|
| 6:37:20| There may be one or two people here, but I think in a list of 24 people, applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23840)|
| 6:37:26| unless I see 24 hands raised, which I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23846)|

| 6:39:59| I'm going to make a motion then to defer the actual vote on the resolution until October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=23999)|
| 6:40:05| giving anybody who has actually turned in an application their five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24005)|

| 6:53:53| I was that the email gave me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24833)|
| 6:53:54| I didn't really come with a prepared speech, so I'll just read the email I sent when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24834)|
| 6:53:57| requested in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24837)|

| 6:54:14| how the Board of Health acts as an unelected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24854)|
| 6:54:16| Those kind of things are interesting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24856)|
| 6:54:17| To get to my point, a couple of points that I think make sense for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24857)|
| 6:54:22| One, I have over a decade of experience in the bar and restaurant industry here in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24862)|

| 6:54:37| can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24877)|
| 6:54:38| I own a business here in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24878)|
| 6:54:40| When I hire people, if they don't show up for the interview, I know they don't get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24880)|
| 6:54:42| job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24882)|
| 6:54:43| I'm a parent of two kids in Knox County School Systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24883)|
| 6:54:48| I'm not an ideologue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24888)|
| 6:54:49| I'm willing to listen regardless of how my personal opinions sit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24889)|

| 6:54:56| I don't need to be that smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24896)|
| 6:54:57| I need smart people to tell me the things I need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24897)|
| 6:55:01| I think one of the issues in the Board of Health is that they talk like doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24901)|
| 6:55:04| And so those of us out there that are trying to listen and trying to understand and trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24904)|
| 6:55:07| to get on board have a really hard time following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24907)|
| 6:55:10| And I think that's one of the most important things the Board of Health is missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24910)|
| 6:55:13| And that's something that I would intend to bring to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24913)|
| 6:55:16| On that, that's all I've really got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24916)|
| 6:55:17| Like I said, I didn't come prepared other than to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24917)|
| 6:55:20| And I'll be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=24920)|

| 6:57:59| And while those aren't specifically addressing health issues, they certainly touch on a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25079)|

| 6:58:36| Yes, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25116)|
| 6:58:38| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25118)|
| 6:58:40| Do you think if you sat on the board of health, you could not be an attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25120)|
| 6:58:46| Well, I currently have two full-time jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25126)|
| 6:58:48| So I'm an attorney during the week and an evangelist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25128)|
| 6:58:56| On Sunday, but it's more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25136)|
| 6:59:00| Can I not be an attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25140)|
| 6:59:03| I would not look at it as my job to provide legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25143)|
| 6:59:06| If they already have an attorney, I totally get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25146)|
| 6:59:12| And what I do, I prefer not to come down to the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25152)|
| 6:59:16| If I can have a week that I don't have to come down here, I'm happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25156)|
| 6:59:19| I would much rather be in my office meeting with clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25159)|
| 6:59:22| helping them solve problems there as opposed to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25162)|
| 6:59:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25166)|
| 6:59:29| Thank you, Mr. Fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25169)|
| 6:59:30| Stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25170)|
| 6:59:32| Mr. Jay Gulledge, if you would, please state your name, address, or the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25172)|

| 6:59:41| And thank you for not sending us home after seven hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25181)|
| 6:59:44| I do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25184)|
| 6:59:45| My name is Jay Gulledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25185)|
| 6:59:47| I live at 2201 Woodmere Lane in Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25187)|
| 6:59:53| I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25193)|
| 6:59:58| I own and operate a small business in Knox County and some of the surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25198)|
| 7:00:03| I have several small cell storage facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25203)|
| 7:00:06| I've got somewhere over 250 customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25206)|
| 7:00:09| I interact on a regular basis and employ the services of a wide variety of contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25209)|
| 7:00:14| and service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25214)|
| 7:00:15| And all of that is to say that I'm daily engaged in the commerce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25215)|
| 7:00:20| in Knox County and the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25220)|
| 7:00:24| And a number of my customers have been affected by the current pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25224)|
| 7:00:29| We're going on six months now where I've been working with those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25229)|
| 7:00:35| They're having to carry balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25235)|
| 7:00:37| I'm waiving late fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25237)|
| 7:00:38| And that is to say that I understand what it is to be impacted as a business owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25238)|
| 7:00:44| and have my customers impacted by this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25244)|
| 7:00:48| At the same time, I had a prior career for 25 years as a scientist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25248)|
| 7:00:54| And for about 10 of those years or so, I focused on providing scientific information and advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25254)|
| 7:01:04| to policymakers and decision makers in Fortune 500 companies, worked with members of Congress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25264)|
| 7:01:13| and federal agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25273)|
| 7:01:14| My expertise was not in the health arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25274)|
| 7:01:17| It was in the environmental science arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25277)|
| 7:01:20| And so I worked with those folks in those regards, in regards to making effective environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25280)|
| 7:01:26| policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25286)|
| 7:01:27| Now, good environmental policy seeks to achieve a balance between, or beneficial balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25287)|
| 7:01:34| between the benefits of a policy and the cost of the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25294)|
| 7:01:38| And the same could be said for health policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25298)|
| 7:01:42| And it's this balance and the use of scientific information and also understanding the impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25302)|
| 7:01:48| on a community that I think I could bring a perspective on for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25308)|
| 7:01:54| And my scientific background-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25314)|
| 7:01:56| Please wrap up your comments, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25316)|
| 7:01:57| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25317)|

| 7:02:34| I live in the Forest Brook area of Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25354)|
| 7:02:39| I guess you have my application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25359)|
| 7:02:42| I'm an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25362)|
| 7:02:44| I've been an attorney for going on 42 years, primarily trial work, civil trial work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25364)|
| 7:02:51| I have used doctors both in the help of my clients and I've also cross-examined them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25371)|
| 7:03:00| I was a medic in the Air Force years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25380)|
| 7:03:05| I was in medical air evacuation during the Vietnam War and then I worked emergency rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25385)|
| 7:03:11| for two years, night shift as a medic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25391)|
| 7:03:15| It's allowed me to acquire some of the terminology, medical terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25395)|
| 7:03:21| I feel comfortable around doctors, representing them and cross-examining them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25401)|
| 7:03:27| So I think I have that, those skills, plus I am a certified mediator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25407)|
| 7:03:35| To answer Ms. Hill's question earlier about whether I could be on the board and not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25415)|
| 7:03:41| an attorney, I think I would probably switch over to the mediator side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25421)|
| 7:03:48| With all of the angst that's going on in the community and with the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25428)|
| 7:03:56| there needs to be mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25436)|
| 7:03:59| There needs to be a coming together because it strikes me that the choices are either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25439)|
| 7:04:05| that you dissolve the board or that they can do whatever they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25445)|
| 7:04:10| So I think there needs to be some, I won't say coaching, but perhaps some education where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25450)|
| 7:04:18| the doctors need to back off a little bit from a mandate side and make recommendations and let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25458)|
| 7:04:27| the, let learning take its place because I think we all can comply with things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25467)|
| 7:04:37| don't feel like are crammed down our throats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25477)|
| 7:04:39| So I think that puts me in good stead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25479)|
| 7:04:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25482)|

| 7:06:14| Um, we just got to avoid this rigid thinking that I think is the issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25574)|
| 7:06:21| And, um, the second thing we need to do is we need to learn how to communicate better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25581)|
| 7:06:25| with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25585)|
| 7:06:26| You know, as a member of this Board, um, I'd make it my personal, um, duty to be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25586)|

| 7:06:46| I'm sorry if I'm not making much sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25606)|

| 7:06:50| But, uh, um, I just want to give you an example, and this was brought up before, um, briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25610)|

| 7:07:13| And I really think this is a good opportunity for us to lead, not only the state, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25633)|

| 7:10:00| Yeah, it's a process-serving firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25800)|
| 7:10:04| That's not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25804)|
| 7:10:09| Everyone here is either of sufficient of age to have heard it straight out of a man's mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25809)|
| 7:10:15| or you were taught that in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25815)|
| 7:10:18| I think we've lost that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25818)|
| 7:10:20| I think everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25820)|
| 7:10:24| motives have become suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25824)|
| 7:10:28| Everybody here that sits on this desk does so to serve the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25828)|
| 7:10:35| just like the folks that sit on the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25835)|
| 7:10:38| and all of you try to do what you think is the best thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25838)|
| 7:10:43| The Health Department does so much more than a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25843)|
| 7:10:46| That's just the tip of the iceberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25846)|
| 7:10:50| And when this hit, the two things as Joe Glow's citizen, I wanted to hear is, what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25850)|
| 7:10:57| And we have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25857)|
| 7:11:00| We have a plan, and it's going to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25860)|
| 7:11:03| And I didn't hear it was going to be okay from y'all, and I didn't hear a concise plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25863)|
| 7:11:07| When it's an emergency, you want somebody that is going to lead a path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25867)|
| 7:11:11| and you don't want any ambiguity at all, if you can help it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25871)|
| 7:11:16| And we've seen a lot of that, and I think that's why people are tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25876)|
| 7:11:20| I've taken an oath four times in my life to support the Constitution of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25880)|
| 7:11:26| and the Constitution of Tennessee, and I understand the misgivings of the folks that did want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25886)|
| 7:11:35| away with the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25895)|
| 7:11:36| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25896)|
| 7:11:37| But on the same token, when I do my job, I do it with the Sheriff Fandy approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25897)|
| 7:11:44| because you get a lot more with respect than you do being mean and divisive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25904)|
| 7:11:50| So if I was elected to this position, that's what you would get from me, is somebody that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25910)|
| 7:11:58| would try to mend fences and try to make sure that we're not going to have a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25918)|
| 7:12:06| And give the people of Knox County a concise path, and give them a voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25926)|
| 7:12:13| because it's easy when you're up here to forget what that's like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25933)|
| 7:12:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25940)|
| 7:12:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25941)|

| 7:12:44| You'll have to excuse me for not giving my address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25964)|
| 7:12:47| I think that's not the wisest idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25967)|
| 7:12:50| I think that needs to be amended and people can be vetted for before the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25970)|
| 7:12:56| But excuse me, I am on a Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25976)|
| 7:12:59| I do not work in the health profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25979)|
| 7:13:02| My position is stipend only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25982)|

| 7:13:09| I don't even think I'll receive a stipend for that meeting since there's no travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25989)|

| 7:13:15| I've been on that board for almost a year now, a little over a year, but the first meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=25995)|
| 7:13:23| wasn't until October of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=26003)|
| 7:13:27| Actually, one of my ideas on that board meeting was to implement gymnasiums outside at parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=26007)|
| 7:13:35| like I had seen in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=26015)|

| 7:13:42| on this board, but in Knoxville, in Mechanicsville, the city of Knoxville opened up one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=26022)|
| 7:13:48| outdoor gymnasiums so people who may not have access to a gym can go work out in the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=26028)|

| 7:14:16| Taking away our freedoms is not one of those things, but advising the public in ways that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=26056)|

| 7:47:34| the planning associates, met last week and tried to find and did find some common ground as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28054)|
| 7:47:44| relates to the rural areas and where we might be able to have some compromise. So I think I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28064)|
| 7:47:53| like to possibly recommend that maybe this body ask MPC to create a working group to bring some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28073)|
| 7:48:05| those recommendations that would come out of that discussion back to the planning commission for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28085)|
| 7:48:11| reconsideration would be my recommendation and based on what our comments that would also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28091)|
| 7:48:18| I think, be in line with what the planning advocates had indicated as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28098)|
| 7:48:24| Okay. Mr. Snowden, well, why don't you connect with me offline about establishing some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28104)|
| 7:48:34| working group and I'll, we'll take that up. I don't have the capacity to think about who might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28114)|
| 7:48:39| be best on that tonight. That's MPC. That's not us. Yeah. You're asking for some sort of group to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28119)|
| 7:48:45| come together and then bring questions to MPC. Yes, it would be essentially the group that met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28125)|
| 7:48:50| last week, just county engineering, Knoxville planning, and the planning advocates. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28130)|
| 7:48:57| would then, you know, discuss about where within the rural areas we would like to limit these two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28137)|
| 7:49:04| and then maybe bring those recommendations back to the planning commission at some point. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28144)|
| 7:49:08| I think that would be what I would like to see come out of that or that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28148)|
| 7:49:14| Okay. I see lights for Mr. Commissioner. I'm going to go to Schoonmaker Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28154)|
| 7:49:20| Haley Beeler Hill, in that order. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28160)|
| 7:49:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've got some notes here from Mr. Murphy. And if I'm reading this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28164)|
| 7:49:29| correctly, there was a stakeholder committee established about 10 months ago with two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28169)|
| 7:49:35| individuals, Pat Phillips and Chris Sutton from the planning commission, Mandy Benedict and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28175)|
| 7:49:41| So at that point, they made recommendations to commission and we approved. And I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28181)|
| 7:49:49| Commissioner Beeler had it, so it was revised, so it wouldn't take action in the rural area. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28189)|
| 7:49:56| what are we changing now, not even a year later? Yeah. The planning commission, Mr. Ooten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28196)|
| 7:50:04| actually was the one that made the motion to include rural areas into the planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28204)|
| 7:50:09| zone. This body chose then to remove that. What I guess my department and in conversation with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28209)|
| 7:50:18| couple of the commissioners, that process occur at the same time as the growth policy vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28218)|
| 7:50:25| And during that process, I think this body and I know myself thought that that process was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28225)|
| 7:50:32| to move forward. Now that that has not moved forward, this would be a good temporary measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28232)|
| 7:50:39| I think, that would allow property owners that their property resides in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28239)|
| 7:50:45| in practicality. But in reality, it doesn't. I mean, essentially the map that is defining that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28245)|
| 7:50:51| rural area is 20 years old. And I think this would be a good process to allow those property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28251)|
| 7:50:58| flexibility to, you know, to use a different type of zoning for their property pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28258)|
| 7:51:07| whatever the mayor chooses to do with the growth policy amendment itself. Okay, so in the time of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28267)|
| 7:51:14| November when we passed the resolution or ordinance, how many planned development proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28274)|
| 7:51:21| have been considered in Knox County? There haven't been any considered in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28281)|
| 7:51:26| So why shouldn't we just leave it the way it is? I think my statement on that would be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28286)|
| 7:51:34| the zoning ordinance has a lot of flexibility in the planned growth area. So people have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28294)|
| 7:51:42| availability to do what they want in there. I think the counter argument could be made that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28302)|
| 7:51:47| in the rural areas, there isn't that much flexibility, hence the need for the planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28307)|
| 7:51:53| development zone there more so than the other. Okay, I'll defer to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28313)|
| 7:52:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm amazed at how clear your mind is after being here this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28323)|
| 7:52:11| But I do kind of remember it that way too, that the planned development ordinance came before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28331)|
| 7:52:17| and engineering and MPC had recommended that the rural areas include the planned development zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28337)|
| 7:52:25| And I believe as a compromise on moving forward with the growth plan, I know that's how I felt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28345)|
| 7:52:34| I'll take this off the table whenever Mr. Beeler made that motion. I see your point and agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28354)|
| 7:52:45| it totally that in the growth area, there's a lot of flexibility what you can do with the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28365)|
| 7:52:50| different types of zonings you can use to accomplish that. In the rural area, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28370)|
| 7:52:55| very little tools that we can use. It's one of the places we actually have enough land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28375)|
| 7:53:01| gathered that someone could do a planned development. So thank you for bringing this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28381)|
| 7:53:10| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Daly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28390)|
| 7:53:14| ancient lore development. It was. That's what started it. That's what started it. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28394)|
| 7:53:22| fortunately for Mr. Boyd, he didn't have to have it. So that was basically designed for ancient lore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28402)|
| 7:53:29| And I agree we need to look at it. We agreed to come back in a year's time, verbally anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28409)|
| 7:53:36| to look at it. There's some rural areas in South Knoxville that won't fit the rural retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28416)|
| 7:53:41| zone, but it will fit this plan rule. So I'm 100 percent behind you. So, you know, we need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28421)|
| 7:53:51| a motion to get it to KKPC Planning Commission and get the ball rolling. Thank you, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28431)|
| 7:54:00| Daly. Commissioner Beeler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, that's one of the things I was going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28440)|
| 7:54:06| procedurally, just looking to some of my more experienced colleagues, isn't the proper action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28446)|
| 7:54:12| to make a motion to ask the Planning Commission to send something back to us? I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28452)|
| 7:54:19| Mr. Snowden was talking about putting together a group that would then kind of go to planning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28459)|
| 7:54:24| ask for something to be developed before it came back to us, because it sort of needs to originate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28464)|
| 7:54:30| out of planning and engineering and then come to us for consideration. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28470)|
| 7:54:34| That is correct. I'm seeing Commissioner Smith's light. Do we not have to ask for that as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28474)|
| 7:54:40| commission? We do, but this was just done 10 months ago. What is going to change a whole lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28480)|
| 7:54:48| If I may... Tonight's just a discussion item. There's actually no resolution on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28488)|
| 7:54:52| I understand. Yeah, absolutely. And I'm not prepared to make any kind of motion. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28492)|
| 7:54:56| just asking procedurally. I think one thing that does need to be said here, and I was the maker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28496)|
| 7:55:00| of that motion to exclude the rural areas, to protect the rural areas. That was the desire of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28500)|
| 7:55:05| the group that I had been working with at the same time. If I'm not mistaken, the currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28505)|
| 7:55:12| designated rural areas is about 20 years old now. A lot has changed in 20 years, and one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28512)|
| 7:55:20| things I think this affects is there are some parcels that are very developable now that 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28520)|
| 7:55:28| years ago were in the middle of the country that now are adjacent to growing areas such as Straw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28528)|
| 7:55:34| Plains, Pike, and the interstate and so forth, but they can't really do anything with them. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28534)|
| 7:55:38| can't put a plan development in them, even though they really should be able to, because the rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28538)|
| 7:55:44| area is excluded. And the plan development process is a good process, and so I do think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28544)|
| 7:55:50| discussion needs to go forward, including the groups like Knox Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28550)|
| 7:55:57| Thank you, Mr. Beeler. Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28557)|
| 7:56:02| Excuse me. So, Jim, who's going to be on this, and I don't mean specific names, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28562)|
| 7:56:12| who's going to be on this group you're wanting to pull together that's different from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28572)|
| 7:56:17| your colleagues that you just met with last week? Who else are you pulling in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28577)|
| 7:56:22| We would probably like to bring in at least one planning commissioner, probably at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28582)|
| 7:56:29| one land developer, and if it's the wish of this body, maybe a member of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28589)|
| 7:56:35| to have just a good broad cross-section of interest, because obviously we want all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28595)|
| 7:56:40| interest to be heard and discussed. All right. Thank you. Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28600)|
| 7:56:46| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=28606)|
