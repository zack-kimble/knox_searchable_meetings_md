| 0:03:25| with 982 wins, the most of any coach in basketball, men's or women's, along with 8 national championships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=205)|

| 0:31:43| We are simply grateful for their sense of dedication and service, not only to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| but also to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1908)|

| 0:32:06| and a Happy New Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| We recently had our annual Christmas party, and we were blessed to honor our Firefighter of the Year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1927)|
| 0:32:14| Garrett Dobbs, and our Fire Officer of the Year, Josh McKnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| You'll get to meet them probably later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| I don't know if you can view this video or not, but there is a video from the Christmas party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| where we were blessed to have some of our county commissioners in attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| and we had a great time with them, and hopefully more of you can come next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| I don't know if Drusilla can show that video, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| It was a good video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| I'm pretty sure we're having technical difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| You're the one that told me to show it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| But it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Drusilla can share it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Thank you, Captain Bagwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| You said that there are 110 car crashes, and those are on the rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| Can you tell me what are some of the factors that are causing those accidents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Here recently it's distracted driving, and that has to do probably with the season that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| We have a lot of people that are focused on things other than driving from point A to point B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| and they're too busy worrying about getting to the mall quicker or getting to Walmart in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| That's the biggest reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| It's always distracted driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| Seeing no other lights on, thank you, Captain Bagwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| Happy holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2015)|

| 0:33:37| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| Presentation to provide an update on child health by Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:54| Thank you, Madam Chair, Commission, for allowing us to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| One of the things that we want to share with you is just the state of child abuse in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| and things that are happening right here in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| The next slide that you'll see, that's just a picture of our advocacy center that's located just about eight-tenths of a mile from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2046)|
| 0:34:13| But what's most shocking is what happens in that building every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| So as you see on this next slide, this is where we've been over the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| Now, our advocacy center only serves Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| In 2018, you can see we had 1,316 kids that came through our door due to abuse or neglect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:33| That was trending down, and in 2020, when the global pandemic hit, we had to move to an emergency-only situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| where we were only doing things that were emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| But what you can see coming out of the pandemic is the rise of child abuse and neglect in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| 1,921 kids served last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| We're already at 1,383 at the end of November with still we don't have all of December obviously completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| We project it's going to be around 1,500 just based on current caseloads and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| But that is a tremendous increase for just one county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| Last year, our advocacy center became the second busiest child advocacy center in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| Only Shelby County was busier, and they weren't ahead by a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| So that's both good news and bad news in what we're presenting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| because the good news is what is happening in Knox County thanks to our DA is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| perpetrators are being put behind bars quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| I believe this year the DA, Sharm Allen, and her team have an 83-0 record, 83 convictions, zero acquittals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2128)|
| 0:35:37| It's over 475 years of prison time for perpetrators against child abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| And what you'll see on the next slide, this is the one that is probably the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| these next two are where my heart goes as a dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| When you look at it by age group, 7 to 12 is where we see most of the kids in Knox County that are being abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| In 2021, 832, almost double the number of kids that suffered abuse and neglect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| This year it's still up, it's down to 591, but then look at that 0 to 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| These are babies that are being abused and neglected in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| We'll have updated numbers that we'll share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| This next one, as a dad of a 16-year-old daughter, troubles my heart the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| And that's at our advocacy centers, you'll see on this next slide, 72% of the kids that we see suffered sexual abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2184)|
| 0:36:33| 999 kids, the next slide if you can, 999 kids that our CIPIT team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:41| which is made up of our Vonda, her team, through our advocacy center, the Department of Children's Services is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2201)|
| 0:36:49| Knox County Sheriff's Office, KPD, as well as the DA's office that reviews every single case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| whether it be drug exposure to sexual abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| 72% of the kids that we see from right here in this county suffered sexual abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| And while that may seem like very down numbers right here at Christmas season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| the reason I share with you these numbers is because there's light at the end of the tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| One year ago at this meeting, you all, at the recommendation of Mayor Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| passed funding to help us with our mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| I want to turn it over now to my colleague, Vonda McGill, who is the director of our Child Advocacy Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| as well as our mental health clinic, just to share the light and the darkness that you all have helped us to bring this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2248)|
| 0:37:36| Thank you so much for letting us give you an update this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| I've been with Child Help for nine years, and I have seen 100 kids plus on our wait list for those nine years until 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2260)|
| 0:37:50| So I'm thrilled to be here tonight to share with you the progress that we're making in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| What happens when children don't get immediate mental health treatment after suffering a trauma?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2275)|
| 0:38:04| Usually what happens before 2022 is they would have to wait six to nine months to a year to get into therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2284)|
| 0:38:14| And when we would call those families, when we would finally have an opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| many times the families would say, we're fine right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| We don't need to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| The family's dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| The children are bearing the symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| So we would often lose those children and not be able to get them into treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| If you can go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| This shows you our therapy wait list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| As I mentioned, it has been 100 plus for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| With the addition of the ARPA funds last year, we have a 30-client wait list at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2323)|
| 0:38:51| and that is a drastic improvement considering that we have had to make families wait after suffering abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2331)|
| 0:39:01| You can see in 2021 we did add another therapist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| We found some additional funding in the community and added another therapist, but our wait list didn't go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| We had reverberation from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| We had recovery from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| We had a lot of kids in 2021, and so we still maintained a very high wait list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| This shows our therapy sessions per week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Prior to 2022, we had one to two therapists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| With the addition of the ARPA funds, we now have five therapists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| and we are serving 125 kids in our therapy clinic every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| We have therapists that are trained in evidence-based trauma therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| We use trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| We use eye movement desensitization reprocessing therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| We use parent-child interaction therapy, and we use play therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| We do have littles as young as 3 years old come in, and, of course, we see up to 18 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| We have a child-friendly room where kids can come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| We have teen items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| We have sand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| We have art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| We have therapeutic games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| So these children are able to come into a therapy session and start to process their therapy and their issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2417)|
| 0:40:25| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| So projecting our therapy sessions with the ARPA funds, we went up to 125 per week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2428)|
| 0:40:37| We are actually restarting a new program with some funding in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| and we estimate being able to hire three more therapists, which will totally reduce our wait list to zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| and will enable us to be able to immediately get children in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| which has been the goal for me since I started at ChildHelp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| We have, as Eddie said, mostly sexual abuse cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| but we do have physical abuse, maltreatment, neglect, drug exposure, domestic violence, witness to homicide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2463)|
| 0:41:14| trafficking victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| So all of those kids can come and get specialized therapy with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| Just two weeks ago, our team dealt with a case where we had two siblings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| who witnessed the death of their mother by murder and then the death of their father by suicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| And we were able to get them into the CAC that day, start to help them with the investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| But we were able to then get them into therapy within two days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| and they were able to actually come into a child-friendly center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| and actually try to start making sense of what had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| I mean, their lives had changed in the course of a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| So the ARPA funds, I believe, have helped us be able to prioritize these cases, get these kids in immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2514)|
| 0:42:02| A month ago, we had a 12-year-old who was being sexually abused by her adult male cousin in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| He was living with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| And she had not told anybody because he had threatened to kill her dad, as she told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| At a doctor's appointment, the doctors seemed concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| and she finally disclosed that, yes, she was being sexually abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| We were able to get that 12-year-old in within three days and get her started on her path to healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| So I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for the difference that the ARPA funds are making in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2548)|
| 0:42:36| and for these families that are walking through the most horrendous situation that any of us could imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:44| because they have people that are trained to help them walk through that and to help them, guide them to healing and hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2564)|
| 0:42:52| And then as we finish up, what you'll see in all of this is in your ELLs packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| And again, I know it's a little bit heavy, but look at the funding sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| because again, you know, one of the things that I am keenly aware of is making sure that we stay diversified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| So as you can see on here, the funding that you all provided last year through the ARPA funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| it's a 30-year contract basically that we've got to draw those down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| That makes up about 37% of the total funding for our mental health clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| It's about $650,000 just to be able to provide eight therapists and therapy for those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| The city of Knoxville kicked in some funding as well through their ARPA fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| The United Way came along, the state of Tennessee through another program that I'm getting ready to share with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| and then private grants and funding where we go out in the community and find additional resources to help keep this going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| So again, we're not asking and relying solely on Knox County, but we are extremely grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| And again, as Vonda shared, those are just two of the almost 3,000 stories over the last year that we could share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2627)|
| 0:43:55| And how important that what you did, you know, a lot of times you vote on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| and you never hear again until they come asking for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| We wanted you to know a year later what kind of impact you're having through your votes right here on kids in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2643)|
| 0:44:11| Of the kids that we serve in Knox County, 70% actually reside in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| because these kids also come through our foster family agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| We cover 17 counties in East Tennessee, but 70% of the kids in our mental health center are kids that reside right here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2660)|
| 0:44:29| The last thing that I want to share with you all is starting, and it's about two slides ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| is something that is going to be a resource for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| It's going to be a resource for the mayor's office and for everyone who works in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| Starting in January, thanks to something that we worked on with the governor's office last year, the General Assembly, and DCS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2682)|
| 0:44:51| there are 109,000 kids in our state right now that live in a home where neither parent resides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| In and around Knox County, that's about 16,000 kids that live right here where neither parent resides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| So we've got a new program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| It's the Relative Care Program that will help keep kids in their homes, in their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| so that they don't have to enter the state's foster care system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| We've all seen in the news the last few weeks just the struggles that DCS is having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| We could go on and on for hours about what else happened because of the pandemic, some federal legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2719)|
| 0:45:26| But we know that a kid is best served when able to stay with either grandparents or relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| So this new program will help them to meet, if they meet 200 percent of the federal poverty level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| they will get a 50 percent of the daily foster care stipend to help them care for kids in their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| Because a lot of these kids also suffer educational neglect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| we've got some funding in these grants to provide educational wraparound services to help get the kids back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| We're working with other community partners, funding that you all already do through the CAC, through ETHRA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| to help with workforce development so that the caregivers who may not have advanced degrees or better paying jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| can get those so that we're helping to lift the entire family up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| We're not just putting money to plug a hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| We're trying to raise the tide, raise all boats with the tide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| So there's a lot of great things going on in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| Again, it's in your packet on the Relative Care Program that we're launching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| We don't know, honestly, DCS doesn't fully know yet how many kids we're going to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| Our Relative Care Program will serve the same 17 counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| which is all of Knox, all of East, and all of Smoky, that our foster family agency does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| So if you all know of someone, if the school system knows something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| you can contact us and we can get help to those kids very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| We thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| We thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| Trust me, I know sitting up there and listening to presentations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| sometimes you're like you'd rather be somewhere on a golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| Many of you may actually be thinking about the warm sun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| considering it's going to be 10 degrees this week, somewhere balmy to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| But I thank you for your service because serving, it's a sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| It's a sacrifice for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| It's a sacrifice for your families, and I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| So thank you all for everything that you do for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| Thank you for what you've done for the kids in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| and I hope you all have a wonderful and very blessed Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| And with that, I'll pause for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| Thank you for the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| It's eye-opening and helpful to understand what we're investing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| and what the impact is making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| This is year one of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| Do you have a plan starting in year four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| One of the things that we are in the process of starting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| is being able to do third-party billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| So the state of Tennessee puts quite a bit of money for that you can draw down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| but you have to get all of your therapists approved through TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| Then you have to get your agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| So that just takes a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| So being able to do third-party billing will help us backfill a lot of that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| And then there's a lot of new funding coming down through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| because everyone recognizes right now that we are in a crisis for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| I believe the Children's Hospital Association has declared it a nationwide crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| So that will help fill some of the hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| And then obviously we'll be coming back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| but it's still too early to say where we're going to need the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| I don't think it's going to be at the level that you all have been at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| because, again, we're trying to diversify that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| But I also want to say that the donors in Knox County are extremely generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| Through all the events that we do throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| when I first came to ChildHelp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| we were raising about $180,000 a year of just private funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2917)|

| 0:48:45| So the donors in Knox County are extremely beneficial as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| So we're trying to keep our funding diversified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| just so that we're not relying on any one source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| because we know that you all are not choosing between good and bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| You're choosing, as Governor Haslam said, between good and good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| And you all have finite resources to allocate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| so we want to be respectful with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| when we come to you all with a request in the future as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=2946)|

| 0:50:56| They're sitting by themselves on a patch of ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| that they painstakingly cleaned to the best of their ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| Indeed, if you look closer, you will see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| The spot they're cleaning is cleaner than any spot around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| Over and over, they brush off the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| set their bottle of water down, pick it up, take a sip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| clean the spot, set the bottle of water down again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| This happens over and over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| A person walking by is overheard to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| Just look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| They're probably high on some type of drug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Let's cross the street in case they come near and ask for some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| It's downright disgusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| They need to get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| But let's you and I stop and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| When we stop, we learn, yes, this citizen is homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| but the root of the homelessness is the mental trauma that they have suffered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| Once a happy working citizen known for being very health conscious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| always clean and neat, life has taken its toll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| taking their health, their jobs, their homes, even their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| The blows have been too much, and they're unable to rise up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| So mentally they're drowning, homeless, mentally suffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| with the vestiges of the memories of the need to stay neat and clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| and the healthy benefits of water peeking through the pain that covers their mind and heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| You see, they're not on any kind of drug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| They're lost, and we, we who have resolved to help them, are moving too slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| You see, a few weeks ago a resolution was made right here in this very room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| a call for unity, much like the discussions that will be going on about unity tonight by others who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| I've come to ask for an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| Has the call been made to the mayor, to the vice mayor, Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| that we need to join in the effort to create spaces for those suffering from mental illness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| Has the meeting date been set for the task force that Larson and Kyle are going to develop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| And what is the dollar amount in the millions that the county will be asked to match by the state as we go forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| We are resolved to build housing for our citizens suffering mental trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| You see, it cannot be an empty promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| That citizen you stopped and looked at may never make it back mentally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| If they can't, where is the housing that we can provide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| That citizen may need the type of housing that provides wraparound services as they slowly but competently begin to stand again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| Have we begun to prepare for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| This can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| We have unified and done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| City and county, local citizens, police and the sheriff's department, doctors, counselors and the DA office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3187)|

| 0:53:21| The sheriff's department needs spaces to take citizens in crisis near them and not have to drive into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| The jail is not an ER, nor is it a place for healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| We must be able to stabilize and restore our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| But to do that, we must begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3212)|

| 0:53:47| We will not cross the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| We won't judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3229)|

| 1:02:15| Sure, they can take a patient and dump them off at the hospital and turn around and leave them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| How does that look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3741)|

| 1:03:49| We've come up with a—I guess it's a revision, what, three or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| Since Monday or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| Amendment 11 provides the following revisions to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| It's in effect from January 1st through—that's what—I thought that's when we were going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:12| We're on 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| 41 is Amendment 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| No, that's what I thought we were on, so on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| Madam Chair, could you or Mr. VandeVate, could you just—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| somebody just outline very briefly what 39, 40, and 41, just give us the bullet points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| because we have three different actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| I just want to make sure we're all clear about which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| Mr. VandeVate, if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| Thank you, Madam Chair, Commissioners Daley and Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| Glad to do so, and we recognize it is confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| There are a lot of moving parts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| Item 39 is Amendment 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| and it simply extends the terms of Amendment 9 that Commission has previously approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| which granted the fine relief that Commissioner Daley has spoken of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| as well as added a waiver of Level 0 fines, and it runs through December 31st of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:08| so it is for the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| We heard Commission last week, and some of the concerns that were outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| We have Amendment 11, which is Item 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| That will cover a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| One, it resets the penalty structure using the figures that you see on the spreadsheet that Mr. Partin prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3925)|
| 1:05:33| Two, and importantly, it extends the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| Amendment 10 does not. Amendment 11 does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| The contract currently expires June 30th of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| Amendment 11 would extend it through January 31st of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| Commissioner Schoonmaker, if you don't mind me following up on your email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| he raised a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| I don't think we've covered this well enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| The reason we went seven months through the end of January is so that in the event when the RFP process is complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| we are changing providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| We are not changing providers in the month of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| There are some logistical implications for that, including radio compatibility with the 911 center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| and this suggestion was actually raised by Director Anders originally to not change in the month of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| Also, if we do have a new provider, they're going to be tasked with moving a management team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| That's going to be a challenge in the month of December, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| So December is simply a difficult month for a new company to come in and establish themselves in the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=3993)|
| 1:06:40| so the decision was made to request an extension for seven months, which was just at the end of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| So, again, Amendment 10 extends Amendment 9 and adds Level 0 penalty waiver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| and runs through the end of this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| Amendment 11 establishes the new penalty structure and extends the contract through January 31st of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4016)|
| 1:07:07| Item 40 is an 803 letter, which if this body were to approve Amendments 10 and 11 is unnecessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:15| but the 803 letter is a contractual requirement that we send a notice to the provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| six months before the termination date of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| If you extend the contract, there's no need for the letter, so that item would be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| I support Commissioner Beehler's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| Is there any more discussion on Item 39, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| Mr. Vanderveet, thanks for that quick overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| On the forgiveness of the amounts through December 31st, approximately how much is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4063)|
| 1:07:52| If I might, Commissioner Schoonmaker, let me defer to Mr. Parton on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| He has been our numbers man throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| He should have a good estimate for you on those figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| Good evening. Kevin Parton, Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| Through October, you would be at $4.3 million, June through October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4086)|
| 1:08:15| Okay. And so you haven't assessed any fees, fines for November then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| No, we haven't done the compliance meeting yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| So we'll do that at the beginning of November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| So it could be conceivably $5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| Very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| Is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| Item number 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4127)|
| 1:08:56| This is Resolution R-22-12-607.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| This is a resolution approving the 11th Amendment to Contract Number 12-500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| with Rural Metro of Tennessee, LP, to provide medical ambulance services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| in Knox County, which amendment revises several sections of the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| to begin on January 1, 2023, and extends the term of the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| to end on January 31, 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| Is there a motion for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| Motion to approve by Commissioner Jay, with a second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| Commissioner Daley, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| I want to make a substitute motion here so we can vote on it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| Mr. Bandate, I do like the Amendment 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| except for this 30-minute or longer 10,000 per event penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4197)|
| 1:10:04| On that, I would like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| I want to make a motion to drop that to 5,000 on that penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| That's at the discretion of Commission, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| We were just trying to be responsive to some of the concerns we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| at Monday's meeting, but certainly any and all of the figures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| are subject to Commission discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| I will say that Mr. Parton did an amazing job in establishing those figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4224)|
| 1:10:32| He turned back to the original contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| Again, there are an awful lot of moving parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| Recognized the fact that we were waiving all penalties for low-acuity patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| and also removing the provisions for Level 1 or, excuse me, Level 0 penalties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:52| and then adjusted the figures accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| So I wouldn't want this body to think they were simply out of the ether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| There was a framework and some considerable consideration given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| to how those figures were established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| but certainly it's at the discretion of Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| and we recognize that the $10,000 figure was a large one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| You are the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| You're the original motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| The substitute motion is going to be to approve Amendment 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| with 30 minutes or longer down to 5,000 per event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| And the reason that I want to do that is that we are not going back to the red and yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4292)|
| 1:11:39| So that means AMR has to meet those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| There's no more red or yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| Three hospitals has to meet red and yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| So there's a criteria that has to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| Commissioner Jay is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| That was my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| I make a motion that we approve Amendment 11 with 30 minutes or longer at 5,000 per event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=4320)|

| 1:24:45| To make an excuse, he used a cigarette lighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5085)|

| 1:28:00| I wanted to speak about the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| Commissioner Lundy had mentioned that it may be in our best interest to establish an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5283)|
| 1:28:10| Due to recent events that have transpired that are very concerning to me and I'm sure several other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:17| So a 15-year-old employee of McAllister's Deli on Shod Road in North Knoxville was fired after being slandered on social media by an employee of Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5297)|
| 1:28:29| Kimberly Glenn, the Knox County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman, who used her personal social media account to, again, a 15-year-old girl, talk about her in negative ways as a spokeswoman of this county's police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:47| Which is, frankly, reprehensible for anybody to be mentioned like that by this county, especially a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5327)|
| 1:28:59| A minor is being talked about like that by a spokeswoman for this county's sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5339)|
| 1:29:07| And it's wrong. It's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5350)|
| 1:29:17| An advisory board, by itself, it may not do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| And here is where we can fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| We can have a functioning, well-functioning advisory board in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| It has to have teeth. Advisory boards have to have teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| It has to have the power to do something rather than just talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5374)|
| 1:29:39| Because if we have an advisory board that people just talk about what happens and they don't have the power to do anything other than just to come to the commission and speak, nothing gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:49| So, what I'm saying is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-1?start=5389)|
