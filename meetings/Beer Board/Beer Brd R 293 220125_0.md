| 0:01:34| I do just have a few announcements to note before we get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=94)|

| 0:02:07| So, we do need to vote on the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| Do I have a motion to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| I need a second. Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| All in favor. Aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| Any opposed. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| All right. So now we'll officially get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| All right. First agenda item is dollar general store number two to eight to eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=153)|
| 0:02:41| Understanding is they are postponing to February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| Yes, ma'am. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| Second. All right. All those in favor. Aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| Any opposed. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| Next is culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| Does anybody here from culture? Mr. Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| I have not spoken with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| I reached out to her as recently as this afternoon and got no reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| I understand that perhaps someone at KPD had spoken with the lessee, the owner of the real estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=192)|
| 0:03:23| and pointing them in the direction that they were going with a different tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| but I wasn't able to confirm that with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| I got a reply after several minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| So, there are a number of things they've yet to complete, and they've been unresponsive for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| Yes, ma'am. I did speak with Ms. Ray, the applicant, in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| That was the only time I've spoken with her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| and at that point she indicated she was going to proceed with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| and would be available to complete the background check prior to this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| but no mention was made of any kind of leasing problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| or anything that might have cropped up in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| And how long ago, again, was the last time you spoke to her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| This was preceding the December 14th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| I've not spoken with her since then or before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| Actually, she wasn't responsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| I guess we can, with no contact, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| there could be a recommendation to take no action based on the information you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| Chair Testament, I would like to ask Mr. Byrd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| in these situations, do we send the person any certified mail stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=273)|
| 0:04:41| when they are going to be back on the beer board and if they do not appear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| you know, something regarding the history of their appearance or non-appearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| or non-responsiveness and that we would not approve them any more extensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=290)|
| 0:04:58| if they did not show up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Do we send that type of communication or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| Typically not in this case, or I haven't previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| That generally comes up in an extension item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| the folks who are approved subject to final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| and kind of a heads up that their 90 days is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| But on an item that's actually on the current agenda, I haven't sent one previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| So I'd like to make a motion to give them another extension to the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| and I will do an outreach to this person to see what their intentions are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| and let them know if I can get a motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| We have a motion to extend 30 days to the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=348)|

| 0:09:47| They were one of the few that didn't reply to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=587)|

| 0:10:41| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| Charles Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| The business address is 745 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| You've had an extension, and would you mind updating us on where you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| It's a big project, and we're still under construction progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| If possible, we'd love to file for another extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Will 90 days do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| I believe 90 would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Is 120 still an option these days, or has that passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| Mr. Frost, do they come back at 90 for an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| Well, the ordinance says once an entity is passed, they have 90 days to complete everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=676)|
| 0:11:23| or that's why they come back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| I mean, it's within the discretion of the bearer board to give an additional period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| or give no additional time for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| Can I ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| Sorry, I didn't push my button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| What's the date of the, I'm sorry, fingerprints or background check for the last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=698)|
| 0:11:46| Looking at the information, it's February 23rd, understanding that Officer Taylor wasn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=706)|
| 0:11:53| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Sorry, man, put you on the spot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| So we just end up being another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| Sometimes the bearer board has asked the applicant to go get updated background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=723)|
| 0:12:11| I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| When things have continued on and we're at approximately 11 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| Mr. Ellis, could you go get updated fingerprints and background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| I know you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Oh, of course, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| And just to clarify, 90 days should be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| So we do 120 days, and you'll do that, and that'll just make it clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| because when we go beyond 12 months, that's the part that's hanging out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| No problem at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=759)|

| 0:12:42| Yes, and then you'll be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=763)|

| 0:13:42| 9-29, cited a second time for selling to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| You received a notice, submitted a revised remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| We postponed to the December meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| and then a supplement to the revised remedial plan was received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| and we postponed again to today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=841)|

| 0:15:21| just to check that the servers are checking the IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=921)|

| 0:15:47| But my plan is to continue doing those inside checks, maybe once a week or at least once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=947)|
| 0:15:56| Does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=956)|
| 0:16:04| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| First, I want to thank Dr. Gatino for your help in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| I know one of your first meetings was the last meeting in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| and I just really appreciate you helping out with us today and for this particular applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| You know, I wanted to say that I really appreciated your new submission and your new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| I'll let you catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| Especially when looking at number 10, you had emphasized checking IDs at each shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=994)|
| 0:16:41| I know that you referenced that you're having Friday meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| I might suggest that you have daily shift meetings as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| consistent with what you were talking about here in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1008)|
| 0:16:56| I'm comfortable with what I'm seeing here, and so my suggestion would be that we take no action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| and we've had an applicant who's really worked very diligently, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| and through the help of the translator, I think we've really been able to have quite a good discussion about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1029)|
| 0:17:16| and seen a much more thorough document, so I'd suggest taking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| Do you have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Well, we wish you luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| Thank you for your hard work and effort into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1051)|
| 0:17:43| Thank you very much to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| It was a bad experience for us, but we learned a lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Dr. Gattino, before you step away, would you mind sharing your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| Coral Gattino, interpreter, 9240 Countryway Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you for your help in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1079)|
| 0:18:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Next we have Copper Cellar Corporation, Smoky Mountain Brewery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1088)|
| 0:18:25| You can state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| John Woodward, 11308 Parkside Drive, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1108)|
| 0:18:38| So on June 25th, 2021, you were cited for sale to a minor, first offense in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1118)|
| 0:18:46| July 12th, remedial plan was received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| On November 13th of last year, four and a half months later, cited for a sale to a minor, second in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1129)|
| 0:18:57| Notice of administrative hearing on 11-15, and then 11-29, submitted a revised remedial plan and paid the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1137)|
| 0:19:07| And then we had the beer board postponed until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| So would you mind giving us an update and tell us where you are and what your plan is to ensure this violation doesn't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| Last time I was here, we kind of reviewed the remedial plan that we submitted prior, and we were asked to focus on four things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1161)|
| 0:19:31| The first being that we get an ID scanner for the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| Second being that we do some self-audits, some self-compliance checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| Third being we do some continued education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| And the fourth, that we'd have some incentive program in place for passing those stings and catching any issues that may arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1184)|
| 0:19:57| Kind of timeline, since we were here on the 14th of last month, on the 15th, we acquired a scanner for my location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1197)|
| 0:20:10| which we've used since with no problems at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| It's actually been a great help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| We've also taken the app that is on the physical scanner, and all of my managers have it on their phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1216)|
| 0:20:24| We've encouraged our team to have it as well, to give them more opportunity to do it as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1224)|
| 0:20:33| So that went into place immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| On the 17th, I met with Sergeant Cadler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| He educated me on how to correctly do a compliance check and what documentation we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1240)|
| 0:20:48| and how we needed to go about that so it was done correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| He and I spent about an hour together and just reviewed what our plan was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1252)|
| 0:21:02| He also, at that point, scheduled a meeting with me for New Year's Eve to do a class in our pre-shift rally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1262)|
| 0:21:10| with our team on how to properly identify things to look out for, ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| We rescheduled that meeting to last Friday, the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1277)|
| 0:21:27| So the 17th was my initial meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| The 23rd of December, I met with Ashton Casey from MDC about continued education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| She guided me to Top Shelf EDU to look for one of their courses that they have available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1296)|
| 0:21:45| or should have available that's not available yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| That would be the replacement for the DVD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| So that is already in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| We have done the ID course with Sergeant Coward at the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| Both of our servers that failed compliance checks have finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| have completed their Aim to Serve certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| and we're continuing that education piece with the rest of our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| We've passed three compliance checks since December 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1335)|
| 0:22:24| and we've also put in an incentive program for our team with passing audits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1344)|
| 0:22:34| in terms of using promotional certificates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| We have a company website that we are able to incentivize our team a little bit with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| so they can redeem them for merchandise, gift cards, hoodies, experiences, trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1365)|
| 0:22:53| whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| So all four of those things that we discussed the last time we've addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| And here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Councilmembers, any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| If I remember correctly, at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| one of the discussion points was the scanner and whether you would be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| So you have been able to implement that, and you say it's successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| It's been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Well, I'm glad that you were able to implement that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| I was really pleased to hear about the use of the scanner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| and the programs that you've initiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| and I'm comfortable with everything that we're hearing and seeing in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| so I'd suggest taking no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| I also wanted to thank you for taking the concerns of councilmembers seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| and really moving forward with implementing the scanners and additional efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| So I'm comfortable with approving moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| Just wanted to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| No other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| Thank you for being here and sharing the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Next, Uptown Bar and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1463)|
| 0:24:36| If you could state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| Jennifer Queen, 1912 Cumberland Avenue, Knoxville, 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| So October 9th of 2021, cited for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| 10-28, submitted a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| 11-27, a month and a half later, your second violation of serving to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1496)|
| 0:25:04| And then 11-29, notice of administrative hearing and was sent, received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1504)|
| 0:25:12| and then your revised remedial plan and fine was received on 1-18 of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| So would you mind telling us where you are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| and what your plan is to ensure this doesn't happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| So we just finished a training class that was recommended by Ms. Ashton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| at the Metropolitan Drug Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| We reached out to Mark with Top Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| I actually brought the scores with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| Saturday, the staff came and took the two-hour retraining class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| on how to properly check IDs, and we purchased additional scanners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| so now we have multiple scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| All IDs are checked upon entry, and then we have also banned all vertical IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| For the underage IDs that are vertical, those won't be allowed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| and you must have ID to enter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| And then I brought the gentleman that was at the door on the day of 11-27 too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| It was just a mistake where he misread the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| The birthday was 12-27-2000, and it was 11-27-2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| Do you have the born on signs posted in your establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| They're in the back and on the POS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| I don't have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| You go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| Sorry, I didn't see your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| You want me to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Oh, it's your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| I'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| You mentioned that you do not allow vertical IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| and IDs required to enter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| Is that a difference from past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| We're trying to discern the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| All IDs are being scanned at the entry point now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| so you cannot get in without approval from ZintelliCheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| It's IntelliCheck ID scanning system, so we have three of those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| So you have a mechanism for avoiding human error is what you're telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| You cannot come in without it being scanned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| So we're trying to take human error out of the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| I'm satisfied with the efforts you've made to improve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| so I'll make a motion to take no further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Councilmember McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| I just want to commend you for the additional scanner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| especially at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| and then also the fact that you brought your employee here that was involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| I think that this is the first time we've actually seen that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| and I think that's commendable for that way your employees see how serious this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| is as it relates to having a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| and what can happen when these mistakes occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| So I just wanted to commend you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Good luck to both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Next on the agenda is the half barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1702)|
| 0:28:29| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Are they on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| My name is Joseph Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| My address is 1001 Walleye Drive, and that is Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| So on 10-30 of 2020, cited for sale to underage to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| on 11-17, 2020, your remedial plan was received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| and then a little over 13 months later, on 12-3 of 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| cited a second time in a two-year period for sale to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| and then received your notice of administrative hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| and then on 1-18 your revised remedial plan and fine was received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| So if you could just give us an update on what's changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| and where you are in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| Well, we can certainly do better, want to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| We have been scanning IDs at our establishment for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| It is unfortunate that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| the scanning mechanisms wear out, get outdated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1770)|
| 0:29:37| and we've had some issues with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| So we're in the process of either updating to newer equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| or using a different vendor that we feel is more, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| secure as far as providing correct information as to whether an ID is fake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| in addition to, of course, that the people are 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| and eliminating the human errors that have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1803)|
| 0:30:12| Until we get this stuff done, we have ABC-permitted servers at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1812)|
| 0:30:21| They kind of have a skin in the game and are responsible for everybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| and making a second effort to make sure that no one underage enters our establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1826)|
| 0:30:35| We've always been a 21-and-up establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| And you still, I see here, that you're requiring two forms of ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| That's correct, a matching form of payment in addition to a Tennessee or state-issued ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1845)|
| 0:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Is the issue with the scanning devices that you don't have enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| or that the quality of the technology is insufficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Well, they all get outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| We've been using ours for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| You know, I can explain what's wrong with ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| You know, it just requires that it's hooked up to electric at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| Otherwise, it dies, and, you know, then they're back to using them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| you know, manually looking at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| which sometimes is a good thing for them to keep in practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| because, you know, not everybody, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| they get used to using that technology and relying on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| and, you know, it's not always reliable as far as particularly fake IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| which has become very sophisticated business, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| And so that's why we're also looking at, I think it's IntelliCheck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| that was recommended by both the KPD as well as the TAVC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1917)|
| 0:32:06| as something that they're using and that's working for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| What's the timeline that you'll decide to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| You know, as immediate as, you know, tomorrow, I've negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| It does cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| We were told it was free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| It's not free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| It costs quite a bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| It's kind of like a transaction charge every time you use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| But we've negotiated, and they're ready to get on board, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| as soon as we, you know, give them the word to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| So you feel comfortable committing to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Yes, we've always been committed to scanning for IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| It's just we had this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| I mean, I like the other ones that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| and they have upgraded models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| and it's weighing the cost of those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| and deciding, you know, what's best for the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| and what's best for, you know, truly checking the IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| I noticed I think there was some random incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| Secret shopper was occasional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| You do a secret shopper occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| How frequent is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| We used to, the larger beer distributors were sponsoring a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=1994)|
| 0:33:22| that they used to do that quite often, you know, about once a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| I think they were doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| I think they've backed off on the funds for that particular program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| I know that we've passed two other KPD, you know, checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2016)|
| 0:33:46| within the 48 days of the one that we, you know, last failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| So I think, you know, enforcement, you know, is happening again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| because it was I think that may have been part of the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| is that during COVID and shutdowns and everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| that enforcement was not going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| Things probably, you know, got out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| And then once, you know, enforcement started again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| I think the problem has started to correct itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| I'll let some of my other colleagues see if they have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| I just wanted to ask, are there specific things you did differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| so that looking at the agenda that we have, there's two remedial plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| Yes, there was one turned in after the first one last October of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| And then this most recent one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| We did get our managers to sort of put their input into as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| Into the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| So that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| It kind of made them commit to, you know, the remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| and understand what it was and, you know, what they were responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| So my question is, what's distinctly different from the first remedial plan to the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| Well, having a staff person that is permitted who's gone through the AIM serve process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2114)|
| 0:35:24| as opposed to just a door person, you know, that they are there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| more to, you know, make sure that there's not trouble at the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| for people, you know, going in past the person checking IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| I think that's the main thing, and I think that's a very important thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| because, you know, these are the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| They all work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| They're the ones who are cited and have to answer, you know, for the actual citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2147)|
| 0:35:54| So I think that that has helped a lot as far as everybody taking this matter very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2154)|
| 0:36:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| So that's the distinctive difference between the first incident and the second is changing who's at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| Can someone refresh my memory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| ABC certified, if there's an offense, is there ABC card revoked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| Is there ABC card revoked if there's an infraction on that employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| Not always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Usually Agent Ramirez goes with a lot of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| and from overhearing his conversations, that's not an offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| I wasn't sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| Well, given that you committed to the new software upgrade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| I think it's really important that you follow through with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| Not necessarily that we call you back another 30 days from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| but I encourage you to follow through with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| It's very serious, and it sounds like you're taking it serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| For this, I'll make a motion to take no further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| And our final, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| our final hearing is Aramark Sports and Entertainment Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2237)|
| 0:37:25| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| If you could please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| Good afternoon, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| I'm Tasha Blakeney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| I'm counsel for Aramark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| My address is 400 West Church, Suite 101, here in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| So just to recap, on 10-16-2021, you were cited for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| On 11-4-2021, the remedial plan was received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| and then a month later there was a second citation for sale to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| and then a notice of administrative hearing was sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| and then consequently received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| On 12-23, a revised remedial plan was received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| and then the fine was received on 1-12 of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| So if you can share an update, please, on where you are in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| Yes, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| I'm happy to do that, and that is a correct recitation of the chronology here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| One thing that I do want to say, and also before I begin my comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| I'd like to make sure that everyone is aware that I have two members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| Aramark management present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| Dave Levins is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| He's the general manager here in the Knoxville location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| and also Mike McDonald, who is a district manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| who actually flew in from Pittsburgh this morning to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| So certainly by that commitment, they do want the members of this board to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| know that Aramark is taking this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| In order to give a little bit more context as well, this is Neyland Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| There are 40,000 beverage sales, beer sales on average at Neyland Stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| and that is certainly not to minimize what the other businesses have been here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| before who are facing issues like this and taking it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| This is also an issue that is being taken very seriously by Aramark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| and the scale is just very, very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| So I want to put that into some context for the members of this body to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| how hard Aramark works to train individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| They have trained over 671 folks to do work for Aramark since they began the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| contract at Neyland, and the two individuals who were involved in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| particular citations, unfortunately one of them, it was her very first game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| and the other one was only her fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| So obviously these are people who were new, they had been trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| and they checked the IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| Unfortunately, it was a human error issue like we've heard about before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| and they just didn't do the math properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| So a couple of things have been done to make sure that we're not back here again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| because there have been many football games where they did a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| and you didn't see them here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| and they made these 40,000-some-odd sales without incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| and they're very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| But obviously that's not good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| They want 100% compliance, as I know you do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| So I have these that I can give you up close if you want to look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| but this is available at every point of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| There is a reminder of the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| There is also outward-facing, this information for all customers to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| and understand what their obligations are as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| So the signage has been updated and changed in order to ensure compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| The most significant thing, though, is this device right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| This is a scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| There are 150 of these scanners that will be at each and every bartender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| in Neyland Stadium in time for the upcoming football season will have these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| This is an Aramark employee who's 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| I can actually scan this device right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| And there it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2474)|
| 0:41:34| And it tells me that this person is not able to purchase alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| Now, what does that mean for Neyland Stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| If any of you have been to a football game at Neyland Stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| you know that your cell phone doesn't always work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| So what Aramark has had to do, in addition to signing a three-year contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| with the scanning company, in this case they're using IntelliCheck services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| they have also procured a network to make sure that the wireless connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| for each of these devices will be functional at each game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| Because to have the technology is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| You've got to make sure it works as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| They are doing that at Thompson Bowling now, and it is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| So we certainly want to make sure that the members of this board know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| Aramark takes this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| They are here if you have questions for me, if you have questions for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| But they are increasing their presence for training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| They are meeting before each football game with staff to have trainings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| and reminders before each game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| So they are doing all of the things that you would expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| and hopefully then some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| Some questions, but I'll allow my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| I do have a few questions, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| Can you tell me how many kiosks are selling beer at any given game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| What I can tell you is there are 150 devices, and that covers all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| Every bartender will have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| So there's not 150 separate kiosks, but there is enough that a device will be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| and in the hand of each person who is responsible for serving a beer in the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| So I know that Aramark is utilizing nonprofit organizations to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| and work many of the kiosks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| So of both of these violations, I'm just curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| were either of those nonprofit organizations or were they Aramark employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| They were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| They were Aramark employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| One of them, as I mentioned, was a very new employee who had just completed the training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| which one would hope might mean that they would be very fresh in the memories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| of what they had learned, but unfortunately experience is also a component of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| So they were both employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| And kind of going, because, again, there are a lot of nonprofits who are involved in this effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| and who are working the games and serving, I'm just curious, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| what happens if a nonprofit is the violator because they obviously aren't an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| and can't be terminated, and then how do you control it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| And I guess I'll just speak from a little bit from experience that there are very long shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| Oftentimes they're just looking for a warm body to try and fill that shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| and I know that we have guidelines that those names have to be submitted five days in advance, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| but they're often fill-ins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| So, A, I'm curious, just with the ordinance that this body passed as it relates to nonvolunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| and nonprofits, you know, again, you know, there's a lot of consequence for a nonprofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2689)|
| 0:44:57| but at the same time being a nonemployee, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| there might not be as much skin psychologically in the game otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Well, one component of that I would answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| I think that's a fair question, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| You know, no matter who the server is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| they are going to be potentially subject to misdemeanor citations by law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| the same as the two workers here in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| Both of the Aramark employees were cited by law enforcement for improperly serving a minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| and had to appear in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| I've looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| They have both accepted responsibility in General Sessions' court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| They had to pay court costs, attend another class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| and remain out of trouble for a period of 90 days and return to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| and neither of them had any prior history at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| So they're given an opportunity to clear that criminal history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| but that is one tool that's in the arsenal of this city and of our community and of law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| is that whether you're an employee or you are volunteering, you have the same obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2755)|
| 0:46:02| and you are also at risk to be cited for a misdemeanor criminal offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| So I think that's probably one of the most significant things that I think would be across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| I noticed that there's Aramark employees or hires, a third party for compliance checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| Can you talk about the frequency of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| I had a little bit of trouble hearing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| There's a third party compliance check that Aramark conducts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| Can you talk about those, the frequency, how many stations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| So what I can tell you in particular, there is an alcohol compliance supervisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| who is actually an Aramark employee and a manager who oftentimes, in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| when we know it's going to be a sold-out, packed arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| those managers will actually be flown in to Knoxville from wherever it is that they work with Aramark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| provided accommodation here in the community, and they float from station to station to observe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2823)|
| 0:47:11| And they're looking at compliance issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| They're looking to make sure that Aramark employees or those who are selling beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| are checking IDs every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| They're also looking to make sure that there is no one who is over-served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| who has served more than two beers at the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| So they are floating around constantly, and they have emblazoned on their shirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2847)|
| 0:47:35| alcohol compliance supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| So it is outward-facing in the sense that people who are coming to make a purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| would see that there's a person there with some authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| and also it is very clear to the folks who work for Aramark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| that they are being supervised under that role and in that kind of floating capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2869)|
| 0:47:57| And that happens every season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| And again, in particular, they will bring people from outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| when they know that it's expected to be a very large crowd at the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| So how many games a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| So how many games a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| Let me ask my client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| This is Mr. McDonald, the district manager from Pittsburgh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| who I think you probably met before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| Michael McDonald, 1713 Bear Run Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15237.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| So I think to answer your question, it's twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| We have on-the-ground alcohol compliance supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| I want to say there were six of them at every game that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| and they are local employees that work every event we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| Now, there's six at the stadium, there's less at the arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| but for the stadium there's at least six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| Bigger games, as much as Ms. Blakely said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| we brought in some people from out of town to bolster that staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| for some of the larger games this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| And then I think the original question talked about the third-party compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| We contract with a company called HS Brands that is scheduled to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| monthly compliance checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| This year, obviously they did them monthly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| but due to the NPOs and the things that we had going on this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| you were gracious enough to help us with that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| we actually engaged them for more games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| I actually wanted them at every game, and I believe they made most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| There may have been one or two that they didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| and that would have been the third-party operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| And talk about what they do when they come on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Talk about what HS Brands does differently than the site supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| The local agents are employees who are supervisors, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| We said they're alcohol-compliant supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| Six to eight of them, depending on the level of event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| they're tasked with going and checking to make sure everybody that's working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| that day is trained, number one, has the valid credentials to be serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| They also review all of the compliance information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| and go through both the teams, service limits, the Red Box training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3012)|
| 0:50:19| Officer Coward has been very gracious with his time to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| and help us do some of that training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| encouraged us with some of the language and things on some of the posters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| we put up that instructs the employees how to deal with a Red Box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| I mean, if you're an employee there, and if we pass these around, it's in your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| I mean, it's right there that if it's a Red Box ID, the first question you ask is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| Are you 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| All right, the undercover agent, from what I'm told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| has to answer that question truthfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| It's as simple as that, all right, and with the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| And unfortunately, when certain some people get to that point of truth, they can't execute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3056)|
| 0:51:04| And I just, you know, it was day one or day five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| All right, but we're making monumental efforts to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| And, you know, just if I may, to go back to the scanner a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| I mean, we actually had to work with a cell phone provider to get us our own frequency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| because you can't get a cell phone signal at Neyland Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| And through the course of the summer, when we were going through the ordinance process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| the other ask was that it validated the ID as far as being a valid ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| You can't do that with something you download from the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| Okay, this is the system, and that's why it took a little longer to get them in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| but they are in place now and will be in place at Neyland Stadium all next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| I may be missing the distinction, but what does H.S. Brands do differently than the compliance supervisor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3111)|
| 0:51:58| They bring in, unfortunately, we had actually asked Sergeant Coward about whether we could use an underage operative with H.S. Brands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3118)|
| 0:52:09| H.S. Brands is not comfortable doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| so we were not able to use the underage person like a normal operative would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| They were not comfortable doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| So it to some degree hampers it a little bit because when the operative goes up, they say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| can I have two beers or three beers, which the first answer should be no because we only serve two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| and the second should be can I see your ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| Okay, now once they see the ID, all right, they have a valid ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| It's not a red box ID, so it kind of compromises a little bit at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| but we cannot find a service company that's willing to engage an underage operative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3169)|
| 0:52:57| and take the risk of contributing to the delinquency offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| H.S. Brands did serve, did attempt, as you just suggested in those scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| Did H.S. Brands attempt to purchase alcohol or stand in line, ask for beer, anything as part of this third party compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3188)|
| 0:53:18| I'm still not understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| You told me what they didn't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| I need to understand what does H.S. Brands do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| Oh, they come, they engage local people, okay, to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| They have a compliance checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| They train them on what they're supposed to do when they get to the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| They have the paperwork they fill out, and then each of those agents are to do 30 shots per game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3214)|
| 0:53:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Okay, so they would hit 30 stands at each for, and this year it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| there might have been one or two games they did miss, but it was almost every game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| and they're contracted to do it monthly at all of our venues around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| Thirty per game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| And it's in a stadium the size of Neyland, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| The ordinance that this board worked with and ultimately passed that you were referencing that allowed this to be occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3253)|
| 0:54:26| specifically requires you to have the scanners in the fall season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| So I'm thrilled to see that you proactively have already gotten 150 scanners, and you're ready to go ahead and implement that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3272)|
| 0:54:41| So I definitely appreciate the activity that you all have done in getting that ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3281)|
| 0:54:48| Ms. Blankney, is the 150 scanners, you said it was for all bartenders in the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| That is anybody, whether they're a volunteer organization or an employee of Aramark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3294)|
| 0:55:03| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| If this is a person who will be serving beer, they will have one of these scanners, and again, it's this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3304)|
| 0:55:11| So it is portable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| It has the network that we've described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| Well, and I appreciate that, and I'm glad to hear that's going to go ahead and get implemented in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| You know, the thing that troubles me a little bit here is that this particular permit holder is not a permit holder that's open seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3323)|
| 0:55:33| Rather, they only served beer on eight occasions at eight home games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3333)|
| 0:55:40| Now, on those occasions, it's 40,000 beers, but it's eight occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| It's not a seven-day-a-week operation, and it's not for away games, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3345)|
| 0:55:53| Officer Taylor, I understand that there were five compliance checks during those eight, and they failed two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| I've got the dates if you need them, but I think Sergeant Coward may have already relayed that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| I think he did, and they're within a month of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| So that's 40% of the time that you were checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| Now, you didn't have the scanners at the time, so that's exactly why this board required the scanners going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3372)|
| 0:56:19| and I'm really glad that you all worked on that to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| But the conflict I have there is you had these eight opportunities, and you had 40% failure rate among the five times it was checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3382)|
| 0:56:32| and this board did a lot of work to give you that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| So I'm a little conflicted between whether or not to send you for an administrative hearing for consideration of a fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3396)|
| 0:56:43| because of how serious this is, or to take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| But I'll let my colleagues talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| Do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| If Mr. McDonald can comment to that, Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| You know, when they do a compliance check, okay, obviously I'm not privy to when or how it's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| but I think it's a little bit of a misnomer that it was 40%, because correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| but there are many, many, many multiple transactions when the checks are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3428)|
| 0:57:16| It's not a one, like a normal bar where you would do one check and everyone in the place knows it and it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3436)|
| 0:57:23| As far as I know, they've come with teams of cadets from time to time, so it's not necessarily a 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3443)|
| 0:57:32| That may be a little misconstrued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3452)|
| 0:57:41| First time I've hit the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| So on those, I can speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| I'm the one that usually writes all the tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3465)|
| 0:57:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| Proper edit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| But on the first offense, the 16th, and I would have to check back with the citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3476)|
| 0:58:03| and our after actions report that we normally send out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| I believe that was the first kiosk we went to that had a violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3487)|
| 0:58:16| and I don't think we went to any more after that because we had checked a bunch of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3496)|
| 0:58:23| If you remember from some of the citations earlier in our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| we went to a lot of places on the strip that caught them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| And then on the second one, if I remember, we went to about 12th to 15th for the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3510)|
| 0:58:39| So it does vary, and there's really no rhyme or reason on how we start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| We just try to change it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| We usually park in the same spot, but we'll try to enter a different entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| and work a different section each week that we go, so that way we're not hitting the same ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| It's usually just myself, Sergeant Coward, and one cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| Due to manpower issues, we usually don't get more than one cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| On some of these visits, though, we can bring ABC with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| They help as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| So you would say an average of how many compliance checks per game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| I feel like this is coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| Maybe I'm leaning on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| I'll just speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| I think at least probably ten each game will go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| So roughly 80 compliance checks is what I mean, averaging?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| What I was saying was you had five games that were checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| and two, so 40% of the games that were checked, they had violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3580)|
| 0:59:47| Obviously recognizing that they're serving 40,000 in each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| I do understand your math, Mr. Roberto, but that does change that percentage significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| if you know that the vast majority of the time that they're checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| they're actually succeeding and doing what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| There were two violations out of the approximately 80 times that they were checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3610)|
| 1:00:18| So that's still we want to be 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| Obviously we need to be 100%, but that's a much better statistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| So I want to echo the sentiments of Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| Council, if you'll recall, when we first heard Aramark come before us to get their permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3635)|
| 1:00:42| we had a lot of in-depth discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| We had a lot of concerns as related to having alcohol sales there in Neyland Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| And so because of that, and I'm very pleased to hear about the scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| I think that that is absolutely a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| I think we were very clear about those concerns and even one sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| what potentially could happen as relates to the well-being of young people there on the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| So just want to put that out there for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3675)|
| 1:01:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| Yeah, well, Officer Taylor put his light on when Ms. Blakeney made a comment about the percentage of the 80 checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3687)|
| 1:01:36| Could you clarify for me, what I heard you say was the first stop you made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| there was a failure to detect an underage ID, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3702)|
| 1:01:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| So I just, I mean, we could sit here and parse numbers all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| I think what that says to me is that maybe it was a lucky strike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| but that was like a core sample of 40,000 sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| and it happened to be you hit the nail on the head the first strike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| So I don't know if you want to elaborate on your thoughts on the comment of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| were there 80 checks over the course of the two games?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| Over those two failures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| Like, did you guys do checks at all eight games or just two of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| No, we did checks at five games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| Okay, at five games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| The first one was on October the 9th, then we did the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| That was the failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| And then we did November the 13th, they passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| November the 20th, they failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| And then November the 27th, they passed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| The first, when the season started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| we wasn't able to start with our compliance checks as we had hoped because of the logistics of cadets being available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3765)|
| 1:02:53| They were out sick for COVID when the season started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| Or do you have to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| Yeah, I've got a little excited with a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| No, I wanted to say one more thing, kind of more of a, I guess, just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| Did you had mentioned it with the, and maybe you're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| Mr. Levins might be able to tell me on this, that IntelliCheck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| does it tell you if it's a fake ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| It validates the ID and it will also give the bartender the opportunity to actually take one step further and ban that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3805)|
| 1:03:36| So that if that person then tries to go and present that problematic ID to another kiosk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3816)|
| 1:03:44| it will automatically come out as flagged and one that would not be accepted at any Aramark point of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3824)|
| 1:03:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| The reason I ask is I think that is also what ABC uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| And to answer your other statement, you said, when we use our cadets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| they do have to tell the truth if you ask them how old they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| And there were a lot of later on in the season that we started noticing that new trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| They kept asking the cadet, how old are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| And of course, the cadet has to tell them the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| Of course, our worry and concern was the fake IDs, they're not going to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| Tell them what they're supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| And that's where the technology comes in, hopefully, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Because there's the risk of human error and deception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| So you have the double layer now that is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3871)|
| 1:04:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| I was just going to ask if you intend to hire HS brands to perform a similar service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| and is there a way that you can commit to doing so every game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| I'm sorry, I didn't hear the whole question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| Do you intend to hire HS brands to continue its role in compliance checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3894)|
| 1:05:00| and can you commit to doing so every game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| We contract with HS brands across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| So it's a multiyear contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| Currently it is with them, and this is, I think, their second year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| But, yes, we will continue to contract with HS brands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| or somebody in the same type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| But right now it is HS brands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| Is there a way you can do that every game instead of monthly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| There is, and that's what we did last year is I brought them in for every game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| because of the extra scrutiny on the NPOs and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| But, yeah, I think we could commit to an every game HS brands visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| My colleagues have more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| Council Member Fuga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| I just want to say I echo everyone's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| but I also recognize that this was the first time this was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| and we were afraid it can change the experience for everybody who goes to a game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3955)|
| 1:06:02| when alcohol is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| I appreciate that you have addressed some of the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| and it sounds like we may have a much better fall football season with these IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3968)|
| 1:06:15| and I'm glad to hear that you're already using it at Thompson Bowling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| during this basketball season and it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| So I'm inclined to take no action at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3984)|
| 1:06:34| but if you're back here before us again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| I don't think any of my colleagues would be so nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| And they may overrule me, but, I mean, nobody's made a motion to do anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| so it's time to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| Yes, I have some of the same concerns, of course, as my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| Just for clarification, I just want to make sure I've got the numbers straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| These were monitored over, was it five games?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| Yes, sir, five games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| And then how many tests per game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| The first failure, that was just once we got a sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| we were probably about three or four hours into our whole operation for the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| but once we made that sale in the stadium, that was the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| So that was just one kiosk visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| Out of the five games total, how many checks did you make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| I would say conservatively 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| Fifty, and you had two failures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Well, two is too many, but I'm inclined to agree with my colleague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| Councilperson Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| I mean, I'm totally concerned about this, but I'm hoping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| and it looks like there's some evidence that the scanners may be a game changer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| So I'm inclined to take no action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| but underlining what my colleague said, if we do take no action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4081)|
| 1:08:08| we are really going to be watching this closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| And next time we see this again, I'm probably not going to discount it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4091)|
| 1:08:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| Councilmember Smith or Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| I just wanted to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| I've been informed by our council that it won't be up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| If it happens again, they go straight to a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| So it's sort of a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| I would just add that we hold Aramark to a pretty high standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220125?start=4116)|
