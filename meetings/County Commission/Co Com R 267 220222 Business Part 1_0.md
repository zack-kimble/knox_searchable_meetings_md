| 0:01:23| In searching for some topic for tonight, I came across a set of sayings that I thought were pretty sharp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=83)|
| 0:01:29| that not only my colleagues could appreciate, but probably the folks in the audience as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=89)|
| 0:01:35| And it goes like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| Keep your thoughts positive because your thoughts become your words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=97)|
| 0:01:43| Keep your words positive because your words become your behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| Keep your behavior positive because your behavior becomes your habits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=109)|
| 0:01:55| Keep your habits positive because your habits become your values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| Keep your values positive because your values become your destiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=121)|
| 0:02:09| And, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to take just a moment to recognize a fantastic citizen of Knox County that passed away earlier this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=129)|
| 0:02:21| Roy Cruz was one of those individuals that was just an outstanding community volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=141)|
| 0:02:29| and did a lot with the Epilepsy Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| He was just one of those guys that when you met him in the hallway of the city-county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| it was like he was your friend for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| And I had the pleasure and privilege of serving with him on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| And we really lost just one of those jewels that we have so many of in Knox County this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=168)|
| 0:02:55| So I'd like to do a moment of silence for him followed by a short prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=175)|
| 0:03:05| Please join me in prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| Heavenly Father, we come to you today asking for the guidance, wisdom, and support as we begin this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=188)|
| 0:03:18| Allow us to engage in meaningful discussion and to grow closer as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| Fill us with your grace, Lord God, as we make decisions that affect the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=204)|
| 0:03:31| Help us to remember that what we do here today is for the pursuit of truth, for the greater glory of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| and for the service of humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| We ask these things in your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=222)|

| 0:20:26| I don't want to be gloom and doom, but I want to be real, and I want to let you guys know how it is on this side of our fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1226)|
| 0:20:35| You need to know that your fire department, which is one of the largest in the state of Tennessee, is on the job every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1235)|
| 0:20:43| No stations have been shut down due to sickness or lack of staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| They've all been there every day, as challenging as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| Know that we're there 24 hours a day, and we're not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| So if you've got any questions, I'll be more than happy to entertain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| Mr. Bagwell, can you state your YouTube channel handle so the large audience that's here, if they want to subscribe, they can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| There's one that is for Knox County Fire Prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| It's under Knox County Fire Bureau, and the other one is Rural Metro Fire TN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| Mr. J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Mr. Bagwell, can you talk about the next recruiting class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| Because you've had great success in offering paid training and a path to an EMS career, and I wondered if you had upcoming sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1288)|
| 0:21:38| Actually, one just started yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| We have 22 in the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| 16 are in EMT school that will last for a number of weeks before they actually go to the fire academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| The other six were already EMS trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| They were either paramedics or EMTs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| And can you talk about the program and how long it takes and the payment part and the path to a career just quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| So very quickly, we have to have them trained in medical calls, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| As you guys know, that's the majority of our calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| And then once they finish EMT school, it will last a semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| Then they will go on to add the actual fire training portion and vehicle rescue, and that may last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| I think the end date for this academy is probably July or August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| Once they complete that, they will be full-time employees of ours, and they'll be assigned to trucks where we need them badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| And that is all paid time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| It's all paid time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| They started getting paid yesterday morning at $0.800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| So this summer will be your next academy or sometime early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Yeah, I think we'll probably have another one in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| We need to have another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| Any other questions for Mr. Bagwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| Commissioners, I'll remind you, I know we've done this before, but obviously we don't have lights in this room to turn on to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| So if you'll just wave at the vice chairman or myself, we'll try to keep a good order of who wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1381)|
| 0:23:09| Next we have Mr. Mike Odom, president of the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| Good evening, Chairman Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Commissioners, thank you for giving me the time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| I appreciate being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Mike Odom, Knoxville Chamber, 17 Market Square, number 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| As we did last time we were in front of you, we gave you all just kind of a little snapshot of some economic conditions, how we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1405)|
| 0:23:34| As you can see, obviously our unemployment remains low, but our job availability remains high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| So just really quickly, as you all know as well, we have been beating the drum about the minuscule growth that we've seen in the region for our 25 to 54-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1421)|
| 0:23:55| We continue to grow, but in that age demographic it's been pretty static.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| A recent report further confirmed our concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| Heartland Forward, which is an organization that focuses on growing economic capacity within the Heartland, about 20-state area in the middle of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1446)|
| 0:24:14| produced an analysis of the talent situation across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| A key measure was educational attainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| So those citizens with a bachelor's degree or higher in between 2010 and 2019, so that decade that we just finished a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1460)|
| 0:24:30| That report indicated that the Knoxville MSA grew this key group by 1.1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1470)|
| 0:24:37| So that means that even though we have a university, one among others, producing about 7,000 graduates a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:46| we're only able to grow that key demographic for us by about 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| That equates to us being 339th out of 380 metros that were evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1491)|
| 0:24:59| And we were also last amongst our eight peer regions that we look at constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| So anecdotally, why this is important to us is because we're hearing from a number of businesses that they're trying to fill those jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1503)|
| 0:25:11| They need, in certain positions, engineers, computer scientists, data analytics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| They need college degrees, and we're not able to hold them right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| And so that's key for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| They tell us we have the right business climate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| We have the right cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| But we need to continue to focus on quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| And so that's one of the reasons why it is further proof in what you're doing related to the multi-purpose stadium is so critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| in building up our civic furniture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| It's also important that we need to really focus on housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| And so one of the things that we've been doing at the Chamber is talking to the utilities about how we can help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| try to speculatively put out housing in the parts of the county that don't have the water, the wastewater right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1547)|
| 0:25:55| so that we can start to get some housing across the spectrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| So it's also related to the talent piece is why we're doing our Explore Internship Strut Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| as well as targeting very specific markets for talent attraction strategies we've talked about previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| So I am happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you, Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| Public Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Mr. Odom, did that study dig into more detail at all about the specificity of why young people are not staying here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1579)|
| 0:26:30| especially out of the university?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| And have you ever talked to the university about possibly doing some partnership or exit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| I mean, if we're producing 7,000 graduates every year and they're not staying here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| if we have X number of high school students that are not staying here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| what are we missing that we can narrow in on even more, and how do we get that data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| The report itself did not dig into that because it was a pretty broad area, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| We've spent a lot of time looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| Two, there is a little bit of a misalignment between the degree programs that have the most students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| and the jobs we have available, and so we've brought that to the attention of the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| And two, and I know this sounds cliche and passe, but we've got to up our cool factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| I mean, you remember it wasn't that long ago that you were a 25-year-old, 24-year-old coming out of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| and there were certain things you were looking for, and so we've got to make sure we have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| And something with, like, again, the multipurpose stadium is a big jump forward for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| and is going to pay pretty large dividends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Director Odom, you and I have met several times over the last little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| and I found out one of your favorite sayings is civic furniture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| And so with that given so, how do you feel like since you've taken over as the director of the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| you have moved that needle in the right direction of a larger pay for those exact people that you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1676)|
| 0:28:03| and also the attractions that we're going to be able to offer to keep them here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| So in terms of the civic furniture, we haven't done much, and I'm happy to admit that completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1688)|
| 0:28:17| We have supported the multipurpose stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| We are looking for the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| There's other things we've done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| The big thing for us in the two-and-a-half years that we've been here is to really try to put the spotlight on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| and figure out where the issues arise so that we can start to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| And so one of the things is internships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| We really need to increase the level of internships, especially with our small and mid-sized businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| And then what we've been doing is when those interns are here is to create a network amongst them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| so that they get to know each other, they get to see the parts of the county that may be beyond just Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| and so that they can start to feel a connection, and then when they graduate, they come back here and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| I appreciate you and all your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Mr. Odom, I know that we in Knox County, we only got so much land mass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1746)|
| 0:29:14| So how are we working with our neighbors like Blount County, Anderson County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| Are we working partnerships with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| We are, Commissioner, and actually a big part of what we've done over the last two-and-a-half years is to solidify those relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| And to their credit, they have greeted us with open arms and word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| I'll give you a perfect example, although one that makes me sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| Smith and Wesson, as you all are aware, that project went to Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| We worked in close partnership with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| We presented to the executive suite together on that, and then when it came to site, to look at the site, we split up and came back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1785)|
| 0:29:56| So we're doing those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| And so if we get a prospect that doesn't have anything we want, we make sure that they look at the other parts of the region because we want them to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1798)|
| 0:30:08| And so that's the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Our mission is to drive regional economic prosperity, and so that's what we're focused on doing is make sure they stay in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:19| Thank you, Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| Commissioner Daly, are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| Commissioner Bussle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| You made a statement earlier, Mr. Odom, about the education they're getting from the University of Tennessee and the jobs that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1824)|
| 0:30:33| Is it the jobs we don't have here, or is it the education, or is it a combination of both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| It's really – well, part of it is you still have to have the students go into certain degree programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| So, you know, computer science is a huge need for us, and the university graduates between 35 and 50 students a year in that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1844)|
| 0:30:53| And versus supply chain management, we graduate about 400 a year, which is by far the largest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| We just don't have 400 supply chain management jobs that need a college degree to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| And so there's a little bit of a misalignment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| Now, one area that we see them making huge strides is data analytics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| It's no secret you guys are probably reading it or seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| We need more data analysts, and the program at UT is really starting to make significant strides to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| And so I think that's going to be a real template for how we can do it in other degree programs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| Thank you, Commissioner, and thank you, Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| Seeing none, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Next, we have Chris Letzos of the Knoxville Education Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| I do want to take a quick point of personal privilege to congratulate Dr. John Rysweek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| on being selected as our next director of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:57| Well, thank you, Chairman, and good evening to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| You stole some of my thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| I didn't know if I could share that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| But in your packet, you could see a letter that I sent out on behalf of our board and our stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| the school board, and what we hoped for in our next superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| We're excited to continue our relationship with Dr. Rysweek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| and know that he's definitely well-positioned to take on the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| and to meet the challenges that lie before our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| It's funny that I'm here right after Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| And for those of you that don't know me, my name is Chris Letzos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| I'm the CEO of the Knox Education Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| I'm newish to town, and I'm eager to get more and more engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| So we, too, have been working with our school district for next-generation learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| to convene a couple hundred individuals to help us plan out exactly what Mr. Odom just described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| We need to get much more intentional in preparing our young people and students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| to make choices earlier in their education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| so that way they're better prepared to make the right choices as it relates to post-secondary opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| So you can see in your packet, we've put together some materials related to an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| of what our intent is over the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| Our foundation has fully funded this process in phases one, two, and three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| and our board just approved phase four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| That will take on the first seven pilot schools that will create a freshman seminar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| and then a college and career access effort at the high school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| Year two will roll out to more high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| and year three, every single high school in Knox County will implement this model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| Then it's not only our goal to help KCS reimagine the high school experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| but then it's our intent to go back into middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| and make sure, again, that sixth graders are prepared to make those choices with their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| to select the right career paths, and our intent is to make sure that we keep them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| Not only do we need analysts, but teachers is a huge need for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| We know nationally at least 800,000 teachers are going to leave the field this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| That's a big problem, and it's something that we're working to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| with various pipelines of growing our own, partnering with universities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| and calling together various partners around that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| In the packet, you'll also see some details on tactical teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| So we were able to match up district staff with community leaders, corporate leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| business leaders to come together and help us create a strategic plan around the Ford NGL work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| Our next steps, many of you will be called to action or to help us along the path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| of creating a steering committee that will be the champions around this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| to make sure that not only does our business community buy into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| and allow teachers the opportunity for professional development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| but also addressing the need for internships and work-based learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| and key investments at each and every one of our schools, from Farragut to Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| We know that every single young person in our school district needs this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| So to that effect, our foundation has also tonight, and you are the first to see this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| and thanks to Commissioner Jay, Mayor Jacobs, and the United Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| we're announcing a $225,000 investment that will go to every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| A piece of that will go to every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| And Knox County really focused on making up the learning gap that COVID has presented to our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| but also to make sure that our teachers and educators and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| have the necessary professional development that they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| Again, we're going to lose a ton of educators and teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| and right now that kind of support is going to be essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| So as you can see in your packet, we're going to give $10,000 to the teacher depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| $5,000 to the clothing center, and then every single school, including our VPK programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| will receive a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| And you can see in elementary school, the proposals and the spending has to go to literacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| and numeracy support, or PD, professional development in middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| They have their priorities, and then again in high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| So on behalf of our foundation and our board, we're eager to continue this relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| Each of you will receive an invitation to come and help present those awards to schools in your districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| and we're excited to continue our relationships with Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| and now with Dr. Reiswick at the helm to make sure that this is the premier community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| for all young people in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Thank you, Mr. Letzos. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| Thank you, Mr. Buehler, or Chairman Buehler, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| Mr. Letzos, you said at the beginning of your remarks that you're relatively new to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| having a long background in education with a fresh set of eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| How would you summarize the opportunity that you see for our public school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| Thank you for that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| I think the opportunity is something that does not often present itself, especially in my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| We have a willing community and a willing donor base that wants to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| We have incredible teachers and families that are really engaged, as you can see behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| I think we have a unique opportunity now to get really tight on our outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| and come together and say that here in Knox County we're going to graduate this number of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| They're guaranteed this, and that we'll do whatever we can to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| And it's very unique to have a community, at least in my experience here so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| I have not heard one no in my interactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| Everything I've heard is a yes, whether it was to serve on a strategic planning committee for the foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| or to participate in the forward work or anything that we've called others to action around for our public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| I think that really separates us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| And as to what Mayor Jacobs said, this truly is a unique and special community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| where people do want to do good by our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Can you talk a little bit about the timing that we discussed in the board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| In a good way, we have kind of the perfect storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| We've got a new superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| We've got potentially a new populated board that's going to be here in a matter of six, eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2266)|
| 0:37:53| We have 40 NGL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| There's six or eight factors that are all colliding at the same time, which could be problemsome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| but it could pose a really unique opportunity to change things in a dynamic way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| Yeah, absolutely, and I'll make sure to send this to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| so you guys can all see every facet of what we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| But I think what it does do, especially for our school district, as Dr. Reiswick takes over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| is to look at everything that's being offered and realize that there are no sacred cows in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| The only thing that is going to be sacred are our children, our students, and their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| And by just stepping back and taking a look at it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| I think we're poised for some really tremendous growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| and also for some really impactful and sustainable initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| Countless partners are ready to come to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| I think between COVID and everything else that you described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| it just will open the door to more and more supports and organizations and investments into our young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Thank you, Mr. Letos, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| I had the pleasure of serving—2020 is a blur, so I think it might have been 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| It could have been 2020—on the Citizens Committee for the Forward Next Generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2348)|
| 0:39:15| Unfortunately, my high school didn't make that cut, missed it by a point or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| Tell us more about the Forward Next Generation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| and will all of our high schools eventually be there in a time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| Because I tell you what, just sitting in on that community interview, it was pretty tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| It is our intent and KCS's intent over this next three-year period that every single high school become an academy model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2374)|
| 0:39:42| We do have a name that will become public soon as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| So in year one, we had seven schools make the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| In year two, our goal is probably another five, and then the remaining schools after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| So what the Forward model does or what this academy model does—and we have examples in Nashville and Louisville and across the country—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2394)|
| 0:40:02| it brings industry into schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| It brings those experiences to every single student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| So again, as I referenced, if I'm a student at Austin East or a student at Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| I know I have various pathways and opportunities for me and in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| I know that no matter where I send my children here in Knox County, when they get to high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| they're going to have the real opportunity and exposure to either go down a CTE pathway or an advanced academic pathway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| And I think really what sets this model apart and what we're so excited about, especially at our board level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| is the fact that we want to take learning outside the classroom and invite every single business in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| every single industry, every single stakeholder to come in and invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| We want to develop the talent that Mr. Odom was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| and we want to make sure that this pipeline from birth to placement is meaningful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| and it really happens for every single student, no matter their zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2448)|
| 0:40:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| Thank you, Chairman Baylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| Mr. Lesos, can you go a little bit more in depth on how you feel like the trade school might impact you or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| No, we're very excited about the opportunity to partner with the trade school and ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| I had a great relationship with ABC back in Tampa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| and we've already spoken here with KCS about opportunities to leverage not only the trade school but TCAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| and then really bring learning down to students at targeted high schools in the urban core and have reciprocal relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| So I think the trade school is going to play a really critical component in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| in getting kids hands-on experiences immediately, but also bridging those relationships and opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| I can tell you half the battle, in my experience, of getting families to adopt CTE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| is just having families understand that this is not only a job, it is a true career path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| So to have a destination and one that they can go and hone in those skills, receive that mentorship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| but then go back to their schools and still be in that pathway as well is going to go a long way for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| in bringing forward to reality, or this model, this academy model, to reality here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| So on completion of the specific trade in the trade school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| will you and the Chamber be working together for placement into the job world?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| I sure hope so. That's our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| So part of this is, and I'll make sure Commissioner Jay or Chairman Buehler gets the full report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| The tactical teams have written recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| and we have a team now writing the actual strategic plan and priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| In there, we want to go very specific as to what the expectations are around work-based learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| internships, and various opportunities, and then what trades will receive the greatest investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| I've mentioned teaching, but if you're familiar with Fulton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| we funded with Knox County Schools a public safety component and the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| Really excited that those classes filled up right away and are hopeful to leverage more and more of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| So yes, absolutely, not only the Chamber, but every company, small to large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| we're eager to work with and have them engage with students before they get to that UT or Pellissippi stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2576)|
| 0:43:03| Thank you, and thank you for all your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| Hi, thanks for coming. This is really exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| I know early on a lot of this was just a dream for you two, and now here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| I just had one question about your student success grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| Is this in lieu of or in addition to the entrepreneurial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| We heard from our principals that teacher-preneur this year was going to be too much for our teachers and our educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2610)|
| 0:43:38| So rather than open up the pool this way, we're making sure that every single school is receiving financial support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| And once we take some lessons learned from this experience, we know we'll be able to scale some of these initiatives going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| So we're looking at all of our programs, from community schools with United Way, to building out a sustainability plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| to Project Grad, and now, of course, to teacher-preneur as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| We want to make sure that every investment we make is scalable and solves a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| But this year we heard loud and clear from our school leaders that adding another thing to teachers, it just wasn't the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| So this way we wanted to make sure that every single school was taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| and that every single student could benefit from this kind of investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| And I can certainly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| Our teachers have been under just unusual stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:30| So is this equally divided, or if one school has an idea that costs a little more than another school, how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2670)|
| 0:44:41| So we work with Knox County Schools to create three levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| Some will receive $1,500, others $2,500, and a third $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| I can follow up with you individually and share how we came up with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=2688)|

| 0:53:39| One way Alec communicates is through facial expressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| He can tell by someone's face if he's in trouble, being praised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| or is doing something unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3224)|

| 0:53:53| Because of not only learning concerns but safety concerns as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| I have been a strong advocate against masks for students and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3237)|

| 0:54:06| which is lacking due to the forced masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| Throughout this federal judge's mask mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| I have been a loud advocate for all kids with disabilities on social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| There were days at the beginning of this mandate that Alec was sent home from school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| due to his inability to wear a mask until I finally refused to come and get him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| Because I spoke out about the discrimination against kids with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| this led to other major issues with the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| There was retaliation to the point he was forced to change schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| He started his school year at A.L.L.Otts but was forced to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| and is now attending Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3273)|

| 0:54:38| Alec is one of the lucky ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| He is only one of 375 students with a full mask exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| However, even today, months later, he is not receiving the best education he could be receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| because his teachers are also being forced to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| I have asked for them to wear face shields, but they are unable to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| Unfortunately, this judge has not considered issues like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| so his teachers are not allowed to wear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| I was at the meeting last week and there were some comments made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| that some people were unaware of the issues facing our children with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| However, I can tell you that I personally spoke with this person for over an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| and explained all the issues that these can cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| There were some statistics and facts given at the last meeting that were inaccurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| and this is very concerning to several of the parents in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| Due to my presence on social media, I have received countless numbers of messages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| comments, and have even met up with several families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3325)|

| 0:55:31| Several families have pulled their kids from schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| and like myself, several families wish we could but have obstacles in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| Every day, children in Knox County are suffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| and for the families who do not see any improvement, this is extremely frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| Three brave school board members have come to ask you for permission to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| to vote on hiring an outside attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3348)|

| 0:55:58| but what I will say is it will not hurt to have a fresh pair of eyes in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| This case is harming students every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| Last week, a board member pointed out that it was better to pay attention now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| and pay an attorney rather than have more lawsuits filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| which I can tell you 100% could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| I am asking you to let the Knox County School Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| make the decision that is best for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3377)|

| 0:57:04| masking was a parent choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| and a very small percentage of KCS students, teachers, and staff actually masked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| It was approximately 2% to 10%, depending on the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| Our concern has always been maintaining the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3435)|

| 0:57:23| and you acknowledge that he could force you to mask in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3443)|

| 1:00:15| I'm a Knox County student, and I have to wear a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| for the whole seven-hour day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3617)|

| 1:01:04| I timed this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3664)|

| 1:01:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3666)|

| 1:01:09| Brittany Warwick, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| I'm coming to the commission today as a concerned parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| and advocate for my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| All three are in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| I did not begin this as a martyr against the mask mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| although I've never agreed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| I began to find my voice when one of my children was denied his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| doctor-ordered mask exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| One of my children was written a mask exemption letter from his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| pediatrician for multiple health concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| After attempting to go along with this year's mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| we quickly realized it was harming him and not helping him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| After delivering this letter to the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| this is where it all falls apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| I was asked to come back for a procedural S-team meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| I was given a pre-typed 504 plan with an offered accommodation for my son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| a five-minute break every 45 minutes set to a timer in his classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| I was also given a typed document that states the district is only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| offering accommodations, not exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| This is your school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| I was instructed to contact Daphne Odom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| the special education supervisor for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| Upon my questioning to Ms. Odom in e-mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| she's never once returned my calls or e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| Jason Myers, executive director of student support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| quickly jumped on board and responded to my e-mails on Ms. Odom's behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| I won't allow you to read those, or I won't read those at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| because they're very troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| He may have jumped on because I found that Judge Greer's order stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| the exemption process should follow last year's C-240 plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| which gives the authority to the school principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| or perhaps it was because I questioned another part of Greer's order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| where it states he would like monthly reports of exempted students' names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| Regardless, Mr. Odom wasn't happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| That was my last interaction with anybody in the special education department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| I've been ghosted by the special education department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| by Jason Myers, by Daphne Odom, Bob Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| and a slew of other members of the Knox County School Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| so I did my own research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| This is why we need outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| I'm a registered nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| Judge Greer decided to follow the 2020-21 mask mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| that was in place for KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| This policy has a sunset date of May 26, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| It's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| We're following a dead policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| A sunset date is a clause, or clause is a measure within a statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| regulation, or other law that provides the law cease to have effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| after this specific date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| KCS is following an invisible plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| Given that, it also encompasses in Greer's basic orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| He mentions to follow the C-240 policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| which gives exemptions on the basis of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| Students, employees, and visitors may be exempted from this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| by the school principal due to a documented medical condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| IEP, or 504.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| Again, Greer's orders were misinterpreted by our law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| and information passed on to the special education department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| regarding exemption is misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| I won't go into the other part, but I'll say this in closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| if I could have just a few more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| All this being said, I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| I have no type of law degree, nor do I wish to pursue one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| but I do know that information is available for those who seek to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| I know that parents will fight for their children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| and this battle is not one for the weary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| If the Knox County Law Department has not addressed the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| that the entire concept of Greer's order is based off of a sunset policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| then we have more problems than we could imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| If they have given instructions for the exemption to be denied at all cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| we have bigger problems than we imagined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| And if the commission does not act to allow the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| to seek outside counsel beyond the uninformed and misguided management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| of the Knox County Law Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| they will have much bigger problems than they will have ever imagined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| problems that will shake them to their very core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| There have been lawsuits by the hundreds from parents of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| that have been discriminated against because of their disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3901)|

| 1:05:13| because, no, as Mr. Myers said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| they did not have a legal court order to disclose my accommodated child's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3921)|

| 1:05:31| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=3931)|

| 1:39:13| I'm greatly frustrated at the lack of results on behalf of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| my children regarding this mandate. And I'm angry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| as there is no end in sight. They are being forced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| to do things with their body for which they have not given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=5962)|

| 1:49:23| Commissioners I'm here to implore you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| to approve the motion to hire expert outside counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| for the current case against KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| As a parent of two elementary school age children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| it was devastating news to hear when the judge issued his mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| But what was even more disappointing is how the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| has handled this case thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=6581)|

| 1:49:50| Not knowing what or even if there is anything that we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| to get our own facts off our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| We need experts on this case and we need them yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| Obviously this is a hot topic and while we can have our own opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| we cannot have our own facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| Because facts are facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| And here are a few facts I'd like to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-business-part-1?start=6608)|
