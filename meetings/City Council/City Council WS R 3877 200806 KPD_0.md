| 0:01:38| All present my smear. Thank you very much. And thank you. Council for taking the time to be here today. Today. This is just the, this is the 2nd workshop in our series of workshops with KPD to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=98)|
| 0:01:52| Review policies and procedures and some other areas of interest that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| As relates to KPD, rather than to just start making recommendations or suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| Uh, this was put together in a collaboration with the chief and with the mayor in order to provide counsel with additional information in advance and give us an opportunity to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=123)|
| 0:02:15| Learn more, do our due diligence prior to making a lot of or any recommendations. So, at this point, I'm going to have a welcome by American cannon and then chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=135)|
| 0:02:28| You go ahead now. Thank you. Thank you. Vice mayor Mackenzie members of the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=148)|
| 0:02:35| I'm really glad that you all have been organizing these workshops related to KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| I think these are critical discussions as we work together to consider what public safety should look like in the future for the city of Knoxville deep dives into topics like police training and cultural competent competency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=161)|
| 0:02:55| Our focus for today will prove to be invaluable as we talk about what the public safety looks like going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=175)|
| 0:03:02| 2 weeks ago, we examined the types of calls KPD response to as well as the crisis intervention team and training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| Uh, we also introduced the co responder model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| Placing a licensed social worker with the responding KPD officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| So, I want to thank counsel for voting to support that pilot pilot program. It is just a 1st step as we continue to examine new models for responding to the public safety challenges facing our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=196)|
| 0:03:27| I want to thank KPD as well as middle broke with park for preparing tonight's presentation and I know they are looking forward to the discussion and I just want to reiterate what vice mayor Mackenzie said that our community is ready to have these discussions ready to have city council help lead and work on these issues and the thoughtful way we're doing this, where we understand fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=207)|
| 0:03:50| What the status quo is before we seek to improve it, I think, is the best way forward for sustainable, long term systemic change. So, thank you. And without any further ado, I'll hand this over to chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=230)|
| 0:04:02| Again, I'd like to welcome everybody as well, and I appreciate the opportunity for this dialogue and to listen to your all's thoughts and be able to present the training that we that we currently give our recruits and all of our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=242)|
| 0:04:21| I think it's very important that you all have a good understanding of how we train and why we train on the subjects that we do train as an opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=261)|
| 0:04:31| I did find a statement that I thought was very accurate as a part of a capstone project that was online from somebody. I have no idea who this guy is Michael Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=271)|
| 0:04:40| But in his dissertation paper, he said training and education allows officers to solve problems creatively and engage the community without reservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=280)|
| 0:04:49| Police training was not be limited to recruit academies, but instead considered as an important and necessary part of evolving and innovating along with the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=289)|
| 0:04:59| And he wrote that, it was actually published in 2016. Still very relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=299)|
| 0:05:06| I personally consider our training, the most important thing we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| It's the most important thing that we give to our recruits is the training. And of course, CALEA, the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Academies realized that several years ago and actually started a CALEA program specifically for training academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=311)|
| 0:05:27| You know, one of the things that we talk about is performance under stress and you'll perform under stress, according to your training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=327)|
| 0:05:36| In police work, we have to respond immediately. A lot of times we don't have time to think. A lot of times people require an immediate response or immediate answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=336)|
| 0:05:46| Or it's simply a horrific situation that we have to put that aside and we have to respond. And what happens is when we have that stimulus, we go back to our training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=346)|
| 0:05:57| So again, that's why I think that's so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| And the next person that's going to speak that you've spoken to already is Lieutenant Sammy Schaefer, who is our training director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| He'll tell you he hasn't been there long. It took me a while to get him in that training position, but he does an incredible job at the Academy and with our training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=368)|
| 0:06:18| And I have every confidence in him. And that is probably the most important position, one of the most important positions, if not the most important that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=378)|
| 0:06:26| Just based upon all the all of the responses that we need to give and how we give those based on policy and procedure and training. So thank you again for this opportunity. And I'm going to let Lieutenant Schaefer take over here and take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=386)|
| 0:06:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| I don't know if I can follow up after that, but I'm sure I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| No, I appreciate it, Chief. No, and once again, as we said, I was with you all last week or two weeks ago, and I think we had some great discussions and we're certainly open to these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=409)|
| 0:06:59| What we're going to present and talk about tonight, a lot of it is where we currently are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| So I don't want you to think that I'm trying to set things in stone as we discuss these. I'm certainly open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| And we've got some ways that we bring in outside ideas now, and we'll talk about those. And I certainly welcome the feedback from these workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=429)|
| 0:07:17| So as we get ready to get started, the first thing that I wanted to do is to follow up with some questions that we left off with in our last time together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=437)|
| 0:07:26| Don't want to spend a whole lot of time on those, but there was a few things that I promised that we would get back with you on. So I assume everybody has the presentation available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=446)|
| 0:07:35| Okay, I'm seeing the nods, so we'll go forward with those. So one of the, here it comes now. Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=455)|
| 0:07:42| So one of the questions that I told you that I would research, the question was asked of the calls that we were answering last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=462)|
| 0:07:50| How many times does an officer actually arrive on the scene? Because when we talked about call dispositions, we talked about our teleserve unit as an option for calls, taking those over the phone, or sometimes they get no response because we've been able to get contact back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=470)|
| 0:08:12| So the, of the hundred, or I'm sorry, the 275,000 calls last year, if we can go ahead and jump forward to that slide, one more there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=492)|
| 0:08:21| So of the 275,000 calls last year, it appears, just trying to pull from those dispositions, that about 63 to 66% of the time we make it to the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=501)|
| 0:08:31| So 173 to 181,000 calls, an officer is physically arriving on the scene to deal with that. The remainder of those, we were able to negate by means of other than the officer actually being present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=511)|
| 0:08:45| So about 60, low 60s percentage of the time, and the rest that we're able to take care of in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| So the next question on the next slide we talked about, did we notice any trends changing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| So I'm still waiting on some data to come back. I was kind of crippled by the fact that our crime analysis unit is getting back up and running as we speak for being able to pull some historical data from some recent computer issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=537)|
| 0:09:13| And then I'm also waiting to get some more information back from 911. They actually archived their calls after about 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| So we're trying to go back and pull some of that. But preliminarily, what I did to try to show a trend, because that was the question that came up, what are we seeing with trends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=560)|
| 0:09:28| I went back to our KPD annual reports. These are available on the website for anybody to view. If you go to the police department's portion of the city's website, there is a page for open records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=568)|
| 0:09:39| And you can see all of our annual reports in addition to other things there. So as we click into the next slide, I look back at the last three years worth of annual reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=579)|
| 0:09:48| and the numbers that were out there. And we see from the calls for service. So those 911 calls coming into the police department over the last three years have continued to climb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=588)|
| 0:09:56| We're seeing more calls coming in, but we are seeing the crime reports that we're having to make as a result of those actually go down over the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=596)|
| 0:10:06| So we're not looking specifically at crime because our discussion last week was on the officer's response to calls. So I stuck with that. So I don't have data on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=606)|
| 0:10:15| you know, as assaults, how they moved, but specifically the way we're addressing calls. So calls are going up, reports are going down. And then if we look at the next graph too, we can see that we're kind of trending down with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=615)|
| 0:10:29| well. So as we look at the officer's disposition for these, we're seeing the arrests and quotations and reports going down, which means that our other dispositions are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=629)|
| 0:10:39| So handling the calls with just communication, giving advice, settling the problem other than taking that corrective action. So if we're seeing calls go up and those go down, then I think that's a good step for both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=639)|
| 0:10:55| And then the next question that was asked was, could we break down these calls that we're seeing more specifically? And the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=655)|
| 0:11:04| But with a little bit of time, again, because we're going back through some archiving and some computer issues. What I hope to do and provide for council later on, which is something that we could benefit from as well, is break our calls down not only by districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=664)|
| 0:11:18| but break down those dispositions by districts and even go so far as to try to break them down by council boundaries as well. So that you have an idea and can talk with your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=678)|
| 0:11:27| about how your area compares to other areas, not only with call volume, but types of calls and then the actions that the officers are taking in response to those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=687)|
| 0:11:37| So that question was posed and I think that would be a great benefit. But if you'll bear with me, that was going to take a little bit of time. But I promise to have that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=697)|
| 0:11:47| So that was kind of where we left off with follow up from last week. So before we jump into the new material, Sergeant Britt's also here with me from that discussed the CIT last week. So if there's any other follow ups from last week, we can address those before we dive into new stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=707)|
| 0:12:05| So I have a question, if you will, on the on the slide that you just shared with us. Cost for service versus the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=725)|
| 0:12:15| So, I mean, and you may not have this information, but just could you give us potentially what are examples of what reports, what types of things would be reportable, if you will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=735)|
| 0:12:32| Sure. So any time there's basically two main categories that we would put those reports into. First foremost, and the largest would be crime reports, with the exception of traffic accidents that are being investigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=752)|
| 0:12:46| And then there's a few exceptions of the traffic accidents or a report. But the meat of our reports are crime reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| You know, a lot of times we get asked, well, why aren't you making a report? Well, we make crime reports. So if a crime has occurred, then we're going to make a report to begin that investigation and to document that crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=773)|
| 0:13:06| If we determine that this current situation, a crime has not occurred, it's not going to trigger a crime report. And we oftentimes have to explain that to folks. There may be a dispute. It may be civil in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=786)|
| 0:13:18| But until a crime has occurred, so to answer your question in a roundabout way, any type of crime you can think of. So is that an assault? Is that a theft? That could be all the way up to, you know, aggravated assaults, murders, any crime is going to trigger a report. But that would also include traffic reports as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=798)|
| 0:13:37| Okay, that answers my question. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| Yes, sir. Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| Thank you. A follow up on Vice Mayor's question. The service calls are going up, but the crime reports are going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=823)|
| 0:13:53| So that means that a lot of the times when an officer is arriving on the scene, there's not a crime, you know, maybe taking place or there's not a crime to report necessarily to fill a report out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=833)|
| 0:14:07| So can you tell us a little bit about what types of situations you might find yourself in where you would arrive but not have to file a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=847)|
| 0:14:17| Sure. So that could actually be a couple of ways. First, like I mentioned earlier, it may be a civil matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| So there may be a dispute going on over a renter's issue or over an unpaid debt or something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=863)|
| 0:14:34| And as the officer gathers that information, they've answered that call, but they realize it's not a crime. It's more of a civil matter that may require avenues through a court or attorney involvement or what have you down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=874)|
| 0:14:47| So there may not be a report made. You may also have a crime occur, but the parties involved elect not to make a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=887)|
| 0:14:56| Now, there are times where that's not an option. You know, domestic violence, domestic abuse, that's not an option. Nobody can just say, well, hey, we don't want to make a report. Everything's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=896)|
| 0:15:06| But let's say you respond to a fight in a parking lot somewhere. And a lot of times maybe they knew each other. So you get there and they say, you know what, we work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=906)|
| 0:15:15| Or somebody's been the victim of a theft. And they said, you know what, it's not worth it. I don't want to do anything else with it. We have those from time to time. So a crime may have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=915)|
| 0:15:25| But the parties involved and typically from a misdemeanor standpoint said, you know what, we're just going to move on with this. Don't want to document it. I'm not going to press charges. I just want to go on about the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=925)|
| 0:15:35| And in a lot of cases, that's their right. They don't have to. Now, again, there are certain crimes they don't have that choice. You know, obviously serious felonies and domestics, like I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=935)|
| 0:15:46| So it could be civil in nature, no report. It could be a crime and the parties elect not to report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| Or it could just be, you know, some types of disputes. So we've got an argument that's taken place between neighbors. Has a crime occurred? Well, maybe there's some disorderly conduct and things of that nature. But you've been able to resolve them with discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=952)|
| 0:16:04| So a couple of options that come to mind if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| It does. So it sounds like a lot of those would be a situation where maybe there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| two parties that are engaged in an argument. Maybe it hasn't escalated to the point where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| there was going to be a threat of violence or any violence. But they just need to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| sort the matter out in a more civil way, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| That's another good example. Yeah. Two folks with a disagreement and either things calmed down and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| were able to intervene early enough before violence occurred. And Sergeant Bridges mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| another good example would be alarm calls. If we remember alarm calls from our numbers last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| those were pretty high. That's not going to trigger a crime report necessarily unless you get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| and discover a break-in is another good example. Thank you. Yes, sir. Other questions on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| Sergeant Schaefer, I think another thing this kind of speaks to as I listen to that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1015)|
| 0:17:03| is that, you know, even with civil disputes, there is the potential that it could escalate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| and become violent. So I think it kind of speaks to potentially the escalation skills that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| officers may be exhibiting when they're talking to the two parties when they go out on that call as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| well. So, but again, I mean, these are really good numbers and I'm glad to see that the reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| are going down based on what we're seeing. Thank you. No, that's a great point and thanks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| making it. Yeah, we don't, you know, we don't mind the higher call volume if we can see better ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| of resolution. No, absolutely. Okay. Thank you. All right. Well, we'll go ahead and jump into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| tonight's information then, which we're going to focus on our training at the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| So the majority of what we're going to talk about is the basic police academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| but a couple of things to set the stage with early on and that we'll talk about before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| get to the end. Our training, we have a basic academy, we have a field training program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| and then we have ongoing training for the officers. So in no way does training end after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| you complete that academy. There's annual and then there's things that we push out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| I would argue on better than a weekly basis to our office. So, but the majority of what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| going to talk about is the training academy. So as we begin to look at the training, the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| thing that I want to point out is that we don't set our own curriculum. We do to an extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| and we've got some latitude with what we provide in the way of not only our basic training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| but in training throughout an officer's career. But there are some entities involved in helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| us set that standard. So if we look at the next slide, we see that the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| major ones that we deal with are the Tennessee Post Commission, CALEA, as the chief alluded to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| earlier, and then our internal training committee, which involves folks from other organizations as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| well. So Tennessee Post Commission, the Pete's Officer Standard and Training Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| they're in Nashville. They're the ones that actually certify police officers. They also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| can decertify police officers for a number of reasons as well. But they tell us as an agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1144)|
| 0:19:10| here's the requirements to hire an officer. They have to pass these things. These are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| requirements to train an officer, and these are the requirements to maintain being an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| And they govern the basis of that. Now, we can do more, but we certainly can't do less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| So we're going to see here in a minute our 880-hour basic academy. Currently with Post,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| they only require 400 hours for basic training. That's getting ready to go up. It's not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| made official yet, at least to us, but I do know that that number is going up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| But we're almost double the state's requirement. So we'll discuss Post. You'll hear me say Post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| a few times. That's our state commission. The second thing, and the chief alluded to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| earlier, is CALEA. I think you all are familiar with the fact that our police department is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| accredited and has been for a number of years, but our training academy is accredited separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| from the police department. As a matter of fact, we were the first agency in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| police agency with its own academy, who had them both accredited separately. We were the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| and have continued to maintain that certification for a number of years now. As a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| we just finished that on-site accreditation last year for our academy. So they set standards that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| we have to follow, just like accreditation would be for a number of institutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| And then the third thing that kind of helps us is with our police training committee. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| internally, we have a training committee and unfortunately we've not been able to meet as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| much this year because of COVID. But if we see on the next slide, that training committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| is made up not only of different representatives within our department, but then we also bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| representatives from outside the department. So within our department, we have different divisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| and we have members from each division that sit on that committee. We have supervisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| we have rank and file officers, we have civilian employees who sit on that. We also have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| representative from park, and then we also have a representative from civil service, which we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| be transitioning to human resources here soon for that seat. But these folks come together and meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| on a basis as needed, sometimes annually. We can see in the next slide that one of their duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| is to review surveys. So anytime that we teach a class, there's a survey on the instructor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1279)|
| 0:21:26| but then there's also surveys that we put out to our officers each year. Are you getting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| training you need? Are you getting the amount of training that you need in that topic? And so one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| of the things that the committee does is look at all this feedback and say, hey, can we recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| that we increase training here? We do more training here or less here, move around or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| So the basis there is that those three groups are influencing the training that we do. So I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| want you to think that Sammy just sits down and comes up with the curriculum. So we get a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| bit of latitude, but we're certainly answering to these three groups right off the bat. So we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| next the KPD timeline as far as training. So one of the options that we have for our younger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| folks is we can hire them in as a police cadet. Now, these are the folks you've probably seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| You see them at special events. You see them downtown helping with parking control. A lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| of times they're directing traffic. They're wearing the light blue shirts for our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| and they're typically ages 18 to 23. They're usually in college, and we're catching them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| But while they're too young to be in the police academy, but we start bringing them in. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| a city employee. They've got municipal enforcement powers to help with things like parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| and we start training them up. And then the goal is that they then transition into the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| academy when they turn 21. Of our current academy class, five of them started off as cadets out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| the 21 recruits we still have in the academy. Five of them actually begin in this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| but it's not required. So we bring folks in that have already passed that age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| or they didn't want to take that opportunity, but we bring them into the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| So a candidate goes into the police academy. They're hired. They're accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| They do a 22-week training program there at the police academy. Now, that's classroom. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| hands-on. That's scenario-based training, field trips. There's a variety of teaching methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| over that course of those 22 weeks. At the end of that, they graduate. They've gotten their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| uniform. They're sworn in. They're badged. They have their police powers. And now then they begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| the field training program, which is another 22 weeks, and we'll talk more in depth about it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| But for those 22 weeks, they're actually riding with an officer out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| The majority of the time when you see... Our patrol officers work independently. They're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| the cars by themselves, but if you see a two-officer in the car combination, chances are one of them's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| in training, with some exceptions. And then we also have the ongoing training that we'll talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| about as well. So that's kind of our timeline of training. So we'll continue going forward and talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| specifically about those 22 weeks of training. A little shout out to the 2017 class there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| as we talk about the recruits. So the next slide, we kind of see a breakdown of the hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| So as we look at these categories, and it may be a little bit difficult to read on the slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| because there's just so many, but you'll see better going forward, these category breakdowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| The categories are set by post. So when you look on here and you see firearms training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| stress management training, administrative, criminal justice, those are categories of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| And then our actual classes fall into one of those categories as we go about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| and those are set by post. We plug our classes into FIT, one of the categories prescribed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1476)|
| 0:24:44| those. Now, as they're going through the academy, they don't do all administrative and then move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| to all firearms and then move on to all stress management. It's mixed up throughout. So in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| day's time, they may actually cover admin and patrol and human relations all in one day. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| it's kind of mixed up as you go and it builds. It's that scaffolding approach to training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| to where we figure out in the early days, the basics, and we kind of build on those as they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| De-escalation and use of force, which are obviously important topics for us always,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| but especially here recently, you'll see these come up in several classes. There are de-escalation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| classes. There are use of force classes, but you'll also see those topics brought up within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| other classes. Firearms, for example, they'll get more about the use of force, especially the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| laws governing deadly force for a police officer. That comes up again when they're learning their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| defensive tactics or the use of their baton is a review of use of force. When they talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| de-escalation, we talk about use of force because de-escalation technically is a level of force for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| us, just the verbal commands. So these things continue to come up. So I just want to point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| that out as well. We also have a lot of topics that we have multiple instructors, but they will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| teach even more classes and we try to stick with our internal cadre so that we can keep that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| consistent and we can make sure that we develop that same message as they go. If we brought in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| a different instructor for every one of these topics throughout those 22 weeks, we may start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| getting conflicting guidance and ideas and perceptions. So we're very specific about our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| instructors and we try to keep them the same for that consistency. But again, just setting the stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| a little bit, but you can kind of see they're on the wheel to break down to the different categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| We're going to go through each of those here next, but you can kind of get a relation as to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| amount of time spent of that over 880 hours. So as we go through these, and the next several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1602)|
| 0:26:49| slides look like this, and unless you've got a specific question, I'm not planning to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| every one of these. I'll explain here and then we'll kind of go through these and specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| look at the amount of time, but please jump in there if you see a class that you want more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| information on. But for each of these slides at the top, like with this one where it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| patrol procedures, that's the category that we just saw on the graph in the last slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| Then under that, you will see what the post commission requires for a Tennessee police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| officer, the amount of time training in the basic academy. And then you'll see what we give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| here in Knoxville. And then below that is going to be some examples of those classes. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| have every class in here, but I've just tried to pull out and substitute to give a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| better explanation of what maybe some of these categories are. Patrol procedures are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| be a patrol officer. So that's obviously going to be a large piece of the graph. Post requires 75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1658)|
| 0:27:45| hours. We cover 251 hours. So that's all of those, not only procedures, but as well as the actual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1665)|
| 0:27:53| the tactics part, the manipulation of actually doing these things. So we can just kind of go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| through the next slides here at a slow clip, but just to kind of read through some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| And if you could please stop me, I don't want to just read them to you, but if one jumps out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| that you would like an explanation of, but Amber Alerts, how to deal with those, bomb squad and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| dealing with the bomb threats, CID scenarios, which is our criminal investigative division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| How do we as a patrol officer work with the detectives, crime prevention through environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| design, child sex abuse in response to those operating the breathalyzer. We can just keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| clicking past these. Next slide. There we go. Crowd control, which is obviously a big one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1710)|
| 0:28:40| these days. The way that we, our different tactics for managing large gatherings, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| it's peaceful or not. Death investigations, elder abuse, human trafficking, juvenile crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| and things of that sort. We'll just keep going. The use of the canines. So the day-to-day officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1732)|
| 0:29:01| how can they incorporate the canine and what they can do before the canine gets there. NCIC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| the use of the record system. NIMS, which is the National Incident Management System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| for incident command. Overdose, obviously a big one today. Problem-oriented policing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| directed patrols. Radar. Again, just more patrol-type classes. I'm sorry, this list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1757)|
| 0:29:25| goes on because there's just so much. Radios, show-calf offenders, sudden infant death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1765)|
| 0:29:32| traffic accident investigation, traffic control. That list just continues to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| So that's patrol procedures. So again, just the meat and potatoes, if you will, of a basic police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| academy. So then the next category that we look at, and these categories are in no specific order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| but the next category is firearms. So the state of Tennessee requires us to do 40 hours of training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| with a new recruit. We do 116. Now that is not 116 hours of standing in front of the target and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| continuously shooting ammunition. We spend a lot of time talking about the safety for not only the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| officer and their use of the firearm, but those around them and including their families. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| classes on how to keep the weapon safe at home. We review the use of force general order, as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| mentioned earlier, and specifically about deadly force. We talk specifically about our weapons that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| we utilize, whether it's our pistols, our shotguns, or our rifles, because they have to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| training and be qualified in all those, and then do their qualifications as well. But we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| incorporate in that 116 hours are other things that include the officer's use of the weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| Active shooter has obviously become a big thing in the last several years. We spend a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| talking about an officer's response to an active shooter, because those are very unique. Time is of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| the essence, and things obviously ramp up a little bit, and tactics change slightly with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| Building searches. So when an alarm's gone off in the building, a business owner's arrived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| and somebody's broke in, we think they're still inside. Learning those techniques for conducting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| those searches. And then officer down, as well as down victims. How do we recover those? So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| anything that revolves around the use of the weapon is in that firearms category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| but we're doing three times the amount that the state requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| So on the next one is our physical training. Now the state requires a total of 40 hours for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| physical training, as well as defensive tactics training, or that hand-to-hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| handling of a suspect, if you will. We separate that. Here at KPD, we see physical training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| and that defensive tactics training as two very unique categories. Physical training is what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| are teaching the officer for how to take care of themselves. Their health and well-being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| short and long-term. So injury prevention, building up endurance, building up cardio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| and things of that sort. We'll do 57 hours of that in the course of their training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| trying to get them better physically fit, and hopefully starting them on a lifestyle to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| maintain that. And then separate from that, we do another 55 hours, which is defensive tactics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| So there they're learning pre-attack indicators, reading body language, and learning the options to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| do. So just because an officer learns that he or she can do these different things in the way of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| defensive tactics, or the use of their less lethal tools, doesn't mean that they've got the mindset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| to use them on every encounter. So a lot of this is learning, here's the situation I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| let's try to do this verbally first, and then let's escalate going up our use of force continuum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| depending on the situation and making that adapt. So a lot of this training comes back to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| not just the actual hands-on manipulation. One of the things that POST requires is the control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| of emotionally disturbed persons. So how do you physically control someone who's out of control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| but to all rights, they really can't help it, so to speak. How do you do that without hurting them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| And so that's part of our defensive tactics program, as well as the use of the baton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| Then we get into driving. So driving, just like firearms, the state requires that 40 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| we do 116. The reason it's the same as firearms is we mirror those weeks. While part of the academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| is in firearms, the other part is in driving. And so that's why for us they are identical in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| But they learn day and night driving, they learn slow speed skills and control of the vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| whether it's from parallel parking to, as the picture shows there, controlling a slide or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| skid. They learn emergency response. So now how do they safely drive and what are the laws governing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| their response for emergency response driving? And then they learn pursuit driving and how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| safely do that and what our policies are for that. The Below 100 is a safety initiative where we try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| to reduce officer injuries and deaths. And then our traffic stops come into this as well. So just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| like with firearms where we incorporate a training that utilizes those weapons, we incorporate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| training that uses the car as part of our 116 hours of driving. So that's traffic stops primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2036)|
| 0:34:04| Then the next few categories get into the law. And we're just right at or just above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| the law requirements because to be honest, what the state prescribes us to do pretty much catches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| everything that is relevant here as well. So the first category is the actual criminal justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| system. So how does the court system work? Not so much the specific laws, but how does the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| system work? How does the public defender's office work? How does corrections work? How do we work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| with other agencies and operate with the DA's office? So that's the criminal justice system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| which is a little different from the classes for, in the next slide, the criminal and constitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2074)|
| 0:34:41| laws. So now we're actually learning law and they're learning fourth, fifth, and sixth amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| from all the amendments. But obviously for law enforcement, very heavy with the search and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| seizure and the statements and things getting into court. A lot of time spent in the constitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| law and then we build up. So we've got our city laws that they enforce, our state laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| and then how those roll over sometimes into the federal system. Also civil laws covered there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| because like we talked about before, a lot of times the officer may be faced with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| that is a civil violation and not a criminal. And then obviously time with, like we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| earlier, dealing with constitutional bill of rights, post arrest and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| Next category is the interpersonal communications. And I would argue that the next few sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| you could really kind of combine these or overlap them. So bear with me just with headings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| because we'll see these next categories really kind of overlap and tie into each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| But the post category for interpersonal communication, so how do we communicate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| people? How do we do that? So some of those that go into the 30 hours of training we do in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| is dealing with the media. So that may be how an officer handles the media arriving on a scene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| appointing a public information officer and keeping them together and providing them updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| and things of that sort. But we also talk about social media. We talk about how the city and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| police department utilize our social media to communicate with folks in our community, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| as how we should behave individually and personally with the use of social media. The officers learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| Spanish, they learn community policing and working with different community groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| crisis negotiations and dealing with someone in crisis, interviewing folks, whether that is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| witness, a suspect or a victim, and then stopping approaches, whether that's just a casual encounter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| a traffic stop, approaching a suspect and making that encounter. But that whole communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| piece there on that initial approach. Next is human relations. And again, you'll see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| these will overlap a little bit, but how do we deal? This is more so dealing with people beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| just that initial communication. So what falls into these 44 hours for us is ADA issues of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| number of types. Street gangs and gang activity fall into that, but child and family services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| which is part of our domestic violence training. We talked last time about the crisis intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| training. Those 24 hours fall into this category. Cultural competency, which we will explore more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| in depth here momentarily, is nine hours of that. And then you can see we continue on with different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| types of folks and different types of situations that would fall into the human relations training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| The next category is emergency medical training. Pretty straightforward. The state requires 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2246)|
| 0:37:33| we do 15 and a half, and that includes not only our basic first aids, but the C requirements for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| bloodborne pathogens and workers comp, and then Narcan that our officers carry for, or Naloxone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| that our officers carry for dealing with overdoses that they encounter. Ethics being the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| category, the state requires three hours. We actually provide 11 hours of that. And a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| of this is prescribed by post as far as the actual topics. The International Association of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| Chiefs of Police is the IACP listed there. They have a code of ethics that's been out for several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| decades that's kind of become the standard in law enforcement. But as you all are probably aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| we have our own internal ethics policies, whether it's our code of conduct, our oath of honor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| things that we take. Our internal affairs unit provides some instruction in this module as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| talking about the elements of an investigation if there is a breach of these ethics. And then a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| class that's actually new to us here in Knoxville that we're actually putting together that POST| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| has required is political influence on law enforcement. We had a little chat the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| day as we were preparing. I don't think this is anything that was spawned by a single event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| and we're still trying to get some clarification on just what all is involved in that. But my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| assumption is not letting an officer be influenced by someone of a higher rank or position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| you know, that your ethics stand strong regardless of who's trying to influence you. You know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| law, you know the policies, and no one can influence that. So that's a new one for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| that we're exploring. The next one is stress. And we actually incorporate, stress goes pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| hand in hand with our physical fitness training. And we try to do that deliberately because this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| is the officer dealing with stress. How do you cope with this on the job? Whether that's utilizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| the city's resources with EAP and stress management, having a good physical fitness and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| nutrition program, relations, how does your family cope with you being on the job? Our chaplains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| assist us with that and do a great job of, we actually bring the families in, the spouses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| the children come in, and they actually go through that class together. And then the critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| incident stress debriefing that our internal peer support team can offer. So that's just all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| ways that can benefit the officer specifically. Written communications goes back to those reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| that we were talking about earlier when we first got started. So this is all the pen to paper that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| the officers may have to do, whether they're compiling their own notes or making a crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| report or an accident report like we talked about. TIBERS is our criminal reporting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| Report writing in Watson is just the software and the program that our reports are entered into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| Use of force and pursuit reporting, which ironically the recruits were learning about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| when I left today. So anytime that we're involved in a pursuit or we're involved in a use of force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| we have to document that. And there's reviews by the supervisors, but it starts off with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| officer themselves writing a report about what occurred. And so when they learn that as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| report writing. Blue team that you see listed there is just the software that that is inputted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| into. And then as again, finishing out written communications would be all of our paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| whether it's a citation or a tow-in of a vehicle, anything in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| The last one, and I appreciate you bearing with me, is the administrative category. And this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| just kind of the catch-all for POST. This is typically a lot of policy-related things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| are specific to the department. So POST only requires three hours, but they know that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| going to be more because every department is different. So there's a lot of these classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| that necessarily didn't fit into one of the other categories. It's an administrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| And as you can see, there's a lot talking about units within the department or specific policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| whether it's a city policy or a KPD policy. They fit in the administrative categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| What's also in this category is the testing. So the recruits are tested academically every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| In addition to that, they are also tested with specific classes. A lot of the classes have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| very specific test that they have to take in addition to their weekly academics. And they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| have to maintain an 80 percent in order to graduate at the end. POST requires a 70, 75 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| depending on whether we're talking shooting, driving, academics, but we require an 80 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| So our standards are actually higher. So with that, I will take a quick break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2510)|
| 0:41:57| and allow you to catch up questions before we go into field training. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| where did I confuse you? Or where did I skip?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2522)|
| 0:42:10| And again, this is all just at the back. This is what the brand new folks are getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| Okay. Okay. I have a quick question. What does SHOCAP stand for? And I may be the only one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2534)|
| 0:42:22| doesn't know what that means. No, that's fine. So you may have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| tell me. I know what SHOCAP, the acronym is. Serious Habitual Offender Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| Serious Habitual Offender Program. For juveniles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| But it's specifically for juveniles. So if you think about, so a lot of times a juvenile may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| be charged to the court system and part of their probation, if you will, is they're classified as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| a SHOCAP. And the officers, one of the things that we do, our officers conduct what we call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| SHOCAP checks. So part of their conditions of that probation is they have a certain curfew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| So the officers may actually go out to the SHOCAPs on their beat, if you will. If they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| got a 10 o'clock curfew, the officer may check in at 11 o'clock and say, just making sure they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| here. And then we report back to the juvenile court system. Are they abiding by that? But it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| serious habitual offenders, but at the juvenile level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| Okay. Yes, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| Yes, Lieutenant. Thank you. This has been very helpful. On the issue of stress, as we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| there's instances, of course, where police officers come upon a horrendous car wreck or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| all those things that would lead to PTSD, as it's now known. What is provided for officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2617)|
| 0:43:47| who undergo these instances? And is there continued counseling or treatment? Could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| you elaborate a little bit on that? I'll actually let the chief answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2633)|

| 0:44:00| Yes. Employee wellness has become a major issue within the policing environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2640)|
| 0:44:08| And so we are developing a whole employee wellness program, but stress encompasses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| things as simple as nutrition, exercise. How you're able to deal with stress is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2653)|
| 0:44:20| But we have an employee assistance program that any employee can access at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2660)|
| 0:44:28| One of the things, in fact, I had a meeting today with our risk management person about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| I want to make it a policy that every officer needs to do a check-in with the employee assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| program once a year, because we're trying to destigmatize that. An officer who's involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| in a critical incident, whether they are the officer involved in using the force or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| even if they're just there, used to be just the one who uses the force, now has to do a mandatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| check-in prior to coming back to work, even if it's the next shift. Eventually, what I'm working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2695)|
| 0:45:03| towards, and I've discussed this with the mayor a little bit, is trying to get an embedded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| psychologist within the department, not to do fit for duty checks, but just to be there as a resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| for the officers. We have peer support now. We have chaplains. Putting all of these resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| together is what I'm working on. We have a lot of it already in place, but a few other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| we want to do, because it's a horrendous issue. We have officers right now who are dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| PTSD from events that happened 10, 15 years ago, and it's just showing up. Part of that original,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| I talked about a critical incident, what we're working on, changing our policy, rather than just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| that one check-in with the EAP program and having that one evaluation, is a repeat after six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| and then they'd have the annual every year that I'm trying to put in place. So destigmatizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| that by requiring it, I think will really help a lot more officers take advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| But again, part of that, as well as a physical exercise program, making sure we have good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| nutrition, and we do a lot of training, be it roll call or in-person and in-service, and we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| to go over those other types of training here in just a minute, on those issues, because we recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| that that is huge. I can give you a great example. My husband and I were driving down Cedar Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2770)|
| 0:46:17| and he went to Central High School, and he was talking about, I remember riding my bike down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| here, and this person lived in this house, and this was a cool place to go ride down to the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| and I was remembering the different, a murder. I remembered the death of an elderly woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| I was remembering things in a totally different way, and it hit me. I thought, boy, we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| normal. We're not normal at all. So that's become my passion, is to really get this going for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| officers, because if our officers are healthy, and happy, and safe, and financially secure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| they can serve the community much better. So, sorry, long-winded, but that's-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| No, no. No, that was really good. And as of right now, is there any in-house psychology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2811)|
| 0:47:02| or psychologists that's provided for the police, or are they-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| Not right now. Not right now. We have access to the Employee Assistance Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| through the city, but we don't have a specific psychologist. And one of the things I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| do is maybe even share them with the fire department, because once we have a new building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| where we're co-located, that would work a lot better. So that would be on the fire officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| as well, to see a lot of things, and deal with PTSD. So a couple of different ways we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| to work through that, but it's important. Yeah, and just, I guess, as a little side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| story, my older brother's a Vietnam vet, and he became a clinical psychologist. And for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| he was on retainer by the Las Vegas Nevada Police Department, specifically for PTSD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2862)|
| 0:47:51| And so, I think it would really be essential that our officers had access to some kind of very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2871)|
| 0:48:00| specific and effective help, because we're stating the obvious here, but that's an enormous problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2880)|
| 0:48:10| for officers and people that have to engage in those kind of circumstances, to have to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2890)|
| 0:48:19| base on their own, let's say. Yes, sir. And thank your brother for me. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| tremendous. He served, and then he's serving the officers as well. It's much appreciated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| but appreciate you taking the time to notice that as well. It is important. It's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| to all of us. So thank you. Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| Another question. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| Under patrol tactics, you mentioned excited delirium. What do you all cover under that topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2922)|
| 0:48:51| So the excited delirium is, first of all, recognizing those signs and symptoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| which typically by the time we get involved, the profuse sweating, the strength,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| the out-of-ordinary strength for that person, not being very rational. And then we discuss-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| Any changes coming up for officers? We discuss the strategies and tactics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| that the officer can employ to try to mitigate those things and what are their options. Of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| use of force comes into that at some point, but recognizing it and then trying to determine what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| to do early on before it has to result in force is the premise of that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2963)|
| 0:49:30| Well, this is a newer term for me, but I think many in the community have become aware of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| as it's become a part of our news cycles more and more and a part of these cases of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2977)|
| 0:49:47| a police use of force that have resulted in death. And a lot of what I found that's come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2987)|
| 0:49:55| has said that the science around that has pretty much been debunked. And there is not really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=2995)|
| 0:50:07| a- What I read that the American Medical Association doesn't recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3007)|
| 0:50:15| excited delirium as a medical state that would cause unexpected death, sudden death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3015)|
| 0:50:26| So I wonder if I would encourage and hope KPD would look into that part of the training and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3026)|
| 0:50:35| see what we can do to update that section because that may be outdated. Does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| seem off to you or something that's possible to look into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| Right. No, no. I don't disagree. I think depending on whether we are responding to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| someone already exhibiting those signs versus someone in custody who begins to exhibit those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| signs, I don't disagree. I think there is, you have to explore those, but you have to explore those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| in two different perspectives, not from the standpoint your response is going to be any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| different. But a lot of times, we're getting there after the fact, after this state has already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| begun. But I do see your point. Absolutely. And I think that I would tell you with all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| classes and that one being no different, that it wouldn't hurt to go back and see what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| currency of that material is. Right. Because an officer may see someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| who is sweating profusely and may think they're seeing excited delirium and that they have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3084)|
| 0:51:34| extra strength that they don't actually have. Maybe they're reacting to whatever in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3094)|
| 0:51:41| environment, whatever in their life that's causing them to react in that way. And that extra force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3101)|
| 0:51:48| would cause additional harm that's unnecessary because they're not in some sort of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| So, yeah, I would really hope we could explore that and see if there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3115)|
| 0:52:02| new lessons to be learned in the last 50 years. And that's an easy check for me to check the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| currency of that. With that, that's a good example of how we try to teach the officers, regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| of the details of that situation, is responding to what they're seeing appropriately. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3134)|
| 0:52:21| you know, whether we're talking de-escalation in the work of CIT by verbally doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| or we're able to increase the number of officers there so that one person's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| on the losing end of this, we can utilize multiple officers. So, that's another good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| example that you mentioned there of how we try to relate our taxes to our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| Mentioned there of how we try to relate our tactics to the situation. You know, it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| our job to determine why they're acting that way at that point, but just to try to resolve it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| keep them and everybody else safe. So, no, great point. And I will check the currency of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3179)|
| 0:53:10| If I can, if I could just speak for just a moment, I want to say that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| really excited to hear that Chief Thomas said that she's working on an employee wellness program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| because I think that especially in this line of work, that is, that's critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| Even with EAP, with stress management, absolutely, there's a stigma around not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3205)|
| 0:53:32| just in this profession, but every profession for a lot of people getting help for themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3212)|
| 0:53:40| especially mental health, wellness. There's a lot of stigma around that. So, I hope that there will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| be a lot of privacy that will be taken into consideration as you guys are flushing through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| that employee wellness program. I do want to take a moment and just encourage my peers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| as we're going through this process and this series of workshops, because there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3234)|
| 0:54:01| dialogue, if you will, please continue to take notes, especially on areas that are jumping out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| at you that we may want to come back to post all of the workshops and questions as we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| formulating some suggestions or recommendations that we may want to be taking into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| So, just want to put that caveat out there as well, because this is a lot of good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3258)|
| 0:54:25| And again, when I look at the graph, what jumps out at me is the two things that I think are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| really important as well for the protection and well-being of our officers, ethics and stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3271)|
| 0:54:39| are at 1% in the overarching equation of their training. So, again, that's a little surprising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3279)|
| 0:54:48| to me. I know that there's so much more that they have to learn and they have to have a focus on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3288)|
| 0:54:55| but I would hope as you guys move along and look at your wellness program that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3295)|
| 0:55:02| and I can't say that needs to be beefed up because I haven't seen the actual curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| as to what they go through, but I will probably come back with additional questions. I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| see more on that outside of this session. So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| And thank you. And one note there, it's hard to put a number on this, but as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| there's a lot of times where some of these topics are incorporated into other trainings too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| Like I said, the stress management and ethics both, but great examples that you brought out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| the way that we build and they're incorporated back into other trainings as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| Right. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| Thank you. Anything else before we move on? Okay. Well, we left off with our field training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| program then. So, we were hoping to have our FTO coordinator here today. He's actually out sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| So, I'm going to do the best that I can to try to cover this and try to answer your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| because once they graduate the academy, they're still in training, but they're actually assigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| to the patrol division, which moves out of my division and into the operations section of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| department. And the field training and the evaluation portion of that is handled there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| but I'll certainly get through this and answer your questions. So, they've graduated the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| They are now assigned to a field training officer. And every day they're being evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| So, at the end of every day, there's an evaluation sheet and they're not only numerically scored in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| categories, but they also, there's dialogue that occurs and there's verbalization of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| performance. So, it's just not all checking numbers. They have to write in how they performed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| in various areas, what they did well that day, what they did poorly in that day, what are any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| more training in that day. This occurs throughout this 22 week process. Another thing that occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3403)|
| 0:56:51| there is the trainee actually has the opportunity to evaluate the trainer. So, at the end of each of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| these phases, we'll talk about the new officer has the opportunity to evaluate the training that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| they feel they've received from that particular officer. Now, at the end of the field training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| if the officer is not performing the standard, then this is an element of termination. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| could be up for termination. If we feel that they're not performing to the standard and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3434)|
| 0:57:22| usually for the purposes of safety, then that employee could be terminated. So, the way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| the program is broke down, it's in four phases. So, give or take, there's about four, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| five weeks in each phase. And you have to successfully complete one phase before moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| into the next. You also, if you're not performing at where you should be at the end of that phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| that phase can actually be extended. So, I may finish my first phase in the prescribed five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3465)|
| 0:57:52| weeks or whatever it is, but the new officer beside me may have not made it to that performance level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| yet. They may get another week until their trainer says, okay, now you're ready to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| into phase two. So, when you look at the phases, and with each phase, it's a different officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| All 22 weeks, that new officer is not with the same training officer. Each phase is a new officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| so that they can see a different part of the city, so that they can work a different shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| maybe, so that they can get a different perspective from that officer. We also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| to remember that that training officer has probably been specifically assigned to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| new officer. If the academy has identified that this officer graduating could use more experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3507)|
| 0:58:34| here or is a little bit weaker in some areas, then we'll try to match him up with a field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| training officer who can improve on that. So, phase one, the officer is really just more an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| observational role. They're going to get involved, but they're going to spend the majority of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| time watching and learning. They've just gotten out of the academy. They're out in uniform, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| they're trying to put all this to reality. When they move into second phase, now then they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| actually getting involved. Now then they're actually engaging the community. They're taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| the reports. They're doing the driving and what have you. So now they've become an integral part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| In phase three, they're really working as a two-person team now at that point. That officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| has progressed well enough that their field training officer is comfortable enough with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| them being their own partner, so to speak. So that field training officer is there to continue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| learning process, but now the FTO is as much of an integral part of that team as they ever were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3566)|
| 0:59:33| Now, fourth phase is kind of unique because in fourth phase, it's a shorter phase because we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| wrapping everything up. And in fourth phase, they go back to that officer they started with in phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| one. And that way, that first officer is able to see how they started in that program and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| they've progressed and can still try to find those deficiencies if they're there. Also in that fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| phase, the training officer dresses down slightly. They're no longer in our full uniform. They're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3594)|
| 1:00:01| what we call our training uniform, which is the polo and khaki pants. They're still there. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| still armed. They're still contributing. But by doing that, it forces the community to engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| with the younger officer more because the theory is when the two get out of the car, you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| to gravitate to the uniform. And it puts that training officer, they're now solo with a watchful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3615)|
| 1:00:21| eye, so to speak. So once they complete that, and again, with each of these phases, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| minimum amount of requirements, their performance level. Once they're to that point, then that final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3626)|
| 1:00:32| FTO signs off and says they're ready to go to solo status. So from the time an officer begins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| training at the police department until they're out there in the car by themselves, making those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| decisions alone is 44 weeks of total training, 22 in the class and another 22 actually out in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3642)|
| 1:00:50| field. Any questions? And we'll pause right there for a second. That's kind of the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| training portion in a nutshell, post-academy, but still under the watchful eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3656)|
| 1:01:08| I have a quick question. So how does that compare for Knoxville to other police forces? I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| there's been multiple times where we've talked about our police training and we've discussed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| our officers have a longer training program than many other forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| Does that include that? How do we compare and does that include that supervised portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3686)|
| 1:01:35| I know that, I don't know from the field training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| Yeah, and I don't have an answer on that either. I would say we are among the longest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3699)|
| 1:01:46| if not the longest. I don't know who to... I could compare with local agencies and get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| back to you. Not all agencies even have a field training officer program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| For example, a small department or any department can actually hire an officer, put them out in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| field with a weapon and they don't have to be post-certified, go through an academy for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| Which is a scary thought. We chose long ago not to do that. That scares me. So yeah, not every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3728)|
| 1:02:18| department has a field training officer program. They're not required to have it. Now CALEA wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| us to have a field training officer program. We had one before we were CALEA accredited as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| If that's something you want, I can check. I'm just curious how our training compares to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3748)|
| 1:02:34| I know you guys had cited before that we have one of the longest. And so I'm curious how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| compare to other similar sized cities as well as maybe even bigger or other places in Tennessee as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3759)|
| 1:02:47| well. But even outside, how do we compare to, I don't know, Denver, Atlanta?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3767)|
| 1:02:55| Yeah, we can check on that. We can check it. That's a pretty easy thing for us to check on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| And I can tell you the value of the FTO program in my own experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| When I came to the police department, I came out of retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| And so I had never done a run along or anything. And so I went through the academy and did very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| well academically. Had never shot a gun, did well in firearms. But the first time I sat in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| police car, I was like, oh. So that field training officer program where you have an officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| evaluating you and with you every day was a tremendous help to me and a great learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| experience. So it's very important. And I would hazard to say most of the bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| departments do have that, but we'll check. We'll check some random departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| I know our academy is longer than most, but I'm not sure about the field training part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| Hi, this is Councilwoman Sima. And I'm interrupting because my video is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| Oh, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| I have two questions. One, how does it compare with the sheriff's department here in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3831)|
| 1:03:58| I know that they have an academy and a field training program as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| but I don't know those times. I don't know those timeframes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| The second one is, have there been situations where somebody has gone through all the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| training and they just aren't going to pass? Are there situations that happen like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| And what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| It does happen. And I'll let, since that gets into employment side, I'll let the chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| but it does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Yes. Yes, ma'am. It does. We do everything we can. Lieutenant Schaefer talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3867)|
| 1:04:34| we extend the different phases to try and get that training going. But some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| people are just not cut out for this. They can't multitask maybe. Maybe they have an issue with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| being able to be safe. They don't have good officer safety skills. They can't protect themselves and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3886)|
| 1:04:52| the other person while they're doing their job. That's why the field training officer program is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| so good because you can do very well academically and then get out there in the field and not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| able to put it all together. And we try to do that with things like driving and firearms and all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| our scenario training as much as we can and make that as realistic as we can bringing in outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| people, especially in scenarios. But even at that, sometimes we just can't get it. And we do try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3910)|
| 1:05:18| provide training as much as possible because we spent a lot of time and money getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| an officer to this point. But we do have a very few that just don't cut it. Maybe one every three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| four, five classes, something like that I guess would be a good average. Not many, but there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| some and it's unfortunate. We do try to find them if they are still interested in police work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3933)|
| 1:05:39| maybe a civilian type of job, maybe forensics, maybe working in our NCIC doing records work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| something like that. So we will try and find them another position in the city if they've been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| good employee and really have tried to learn. And that's what we found is they try to learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| they try very hard, but they just can't cut it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3952)|
| 1:06:01| Other questions on the field training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| Okay, so we'll go forward in the last section of training before we do the deep dive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| at cultural competency is our annual in-service training. But what's also kind of grouped into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| this is ongoing training in general. So if we think back to POST, the POST commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| they, one of the requirements for police officers is we have to maintain 40 hours of training each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| year. And some of that they prescribe and some of it that we get to prescribe, but that 40 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| is required. And the way that we do that, we've had to get very creative this year. Some of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| have to do hands-on delivery, but we've gotten a lot better about web-based delivery this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| because of COVID and trying to limit the exposure in a classroom setting. If an officer does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| complete their prescribed training, we have to submit that through the training academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| we submit that to POST. And if they fail to complete that, they can and will be decommissioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| by the POST commission. It's not, the annual training is not an option. But what we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| want to remember too, we're going to look specifically at annual training, but I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| want to miss the fact that our officers are receiving training in their roll calls. So when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| they come in each day, they report to roll call where they get their assignments and roles taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| and what have you, and information is pushed out. There's training that is done there, but then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| also have through our system known as our PowerDMS system, which is our web-based training. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| able to push out policy updates or training briefs or videos and things, and the officers have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| electronically sign that they've seen those and acknowledge that. And then we also put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| training updates and training briefs. So while we require those 40 hours, there's just as much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| if not more, of that occurs ongoing. So if we look at the next slide, of those 40 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4060)|
| 1:07:47| POST tells us that, hey, you have to do these things this year. And each year they actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| look at, and sometimes it changes, sometimes it stays pretty standard, and then we get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| latitude to incorporate what we want to do for refresher training. So anything, this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| actual 2020 in-service. So this is what all of our officers are completing this year for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| in-service training. Anything with an asterisk is something that the POST Commission has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| you have to do this one. So we'll hit those first. So the recertification and our less lethals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| whether that's the baton or OC spray or taser, those are annually or bi-annually recertifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| that we have to do. POST Commission also requires eight hours of firearms training per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| And again, that's not eight hours of standing on the line and firing rounds. That is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| refresher zone policy and procedures and laws, use of the firearm, care and maintenance of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| firearm, reloading, manipulation skills. They have also required us to do two hours of vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4121)|
| 1:08:47| operations. And it tends to alternate year to year, whether that's classroom refresher training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| on our laws and policies of driving, or if that's actually behind the wheel on the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| This year, it just happens to be classroom. They've also prescribed this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| child sex abuse, mental health, and I thought there was autism. So those are actually required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| And honestly, we see those required each year. Now, those have become pretty standard in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| that officers have to refresh in those. Everything that else is there is, most of the rest of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| is things that we get the option to add ourself. This year, we had a big change in our use of force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| policy, where we added some verbiage, took out some techniques. And so we felt it important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| make sure all the officers not only had to sign off on that new policy, but they also got a training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| session to discuss those changes and options for that. And right inside of that was defensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| tactics, how that changed. This year, we're requiring all of our employees to complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| harassment training. We had an incident here last year that we decided that was collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4188)|

| 1:10:12| and changes in laws that affect us, and we put those out. We also decided to add a refresher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| on our de-escalation training, as well as our cultural bias training, in light of these being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| some pretty serious topics these days and throughout. But we decided to put in, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| updated those anyway, so we wanted to put out a refresher to our officers as well. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4228)|

| 1:10:45| the other classes you see there. So that is what every officer, from the chief herself down, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4245)|

| 1:10:56| questions on in-service? And each year, you see about half of that list stay the same, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| other half will be different classes based on what's going on in the department. A few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4260)|
| 1:11:07| ago, we had our CIT was part of that training. When we got everybody in the department trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| it was a large chunk of that particular year. So questions on year-to-year in-service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| Yes, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| It sounded like some of the earlier trainings are, there's a certain score they have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| or they don't pass. For the annual training, is it just a time-based, I completed the hours required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4283)|
| 1:11:31| or I had to score a certain number to stay active?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| No, great question. Thanks for bringing that up. Yes, there is an academic requirement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| POST requires a written test that covers all the material. They also require your firearms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4299)|
| 1:11:46| recertification scores and driving scores, if it's actually behind the wheel. But all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| classes, each instructor has to submit test questions, and then we submit those to POST| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| as part of our annual package. POST has to approve our in-service package and the test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4316)|

| 1:12:05| Okay. And just a second question while I have you. What's the adult version of SHOCAP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| where there's a frequent offender or... Enhanced probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4330)|
| 1:12:15| Enhanced probation. Okay. And just generally from a policy standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4335)|
| 1:12:21| how do you all think about that? On one end of the spectrum, I can see the same officer attending to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| the same person could establish some trust. On the other end of the spectrum, I can see there being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| some risk associated with that where a fresh set of eyes might be helpful. How do you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| from a policy standpoint, think about those situations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| In still talking about the SHOCAP or am I... I might be misunderstanding your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| Yeah, maybe the acronym threw it off. But if there's someone that is frequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4367)|
| 1:12:56| arrested or I'm thinking maybe some of our homeless population where there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| visits from officers. I know for Officer Clinton, for example, sometimes he establishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| some trust with folks. But for individuals that get frequent calls or require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4385)|
| 1:13:13| attention from KPD frequently, do you all send the same officer to establish trust more times than not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| Or do you... No, no. Usually not. And it works out from a couple of different angles. It depends on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4399)|
| 1:13:26| who's working when the call comes in. Chances are an officer working. It also depends on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| I may have answered that call yesterday and the call's coming in today with the same person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| but I'm already tied up on something else when other officer's getting that. So sometimes it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| a different officer just by chance. But I will tell you there's communications amongst the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| officers and the supervisors will pick up on this as well. Just to be flat honest, there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| officers and repeat offenders, if you will, who we know are not going to get along. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| officers are very good to get on the radio and say, you might want to send somebody else to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| one. I don't have that good rapport. There's people that can handle this person better than I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| have. At the same time, there's officers who will jump on there and go, hey, I deal with this family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| on a very regular basis. I have a good rapport. If you'll let me go out there and talk to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| I can probably help resolve this. So we don't have a policy necessarily of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4454)|
| 1:14:21| do you or don't you answer repeatedly with those, but I'll tell you a lot of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| the officers were very good knowing when not to make that repeated answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| Okay. Thank you. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| Next question. Outside of the legal updates during the in-service trainings, I didn't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4474)|
| 1:14:42| an opportunity throughout the trainings to discuss tenancy law, constitutional law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4482)|
| 1:14:49| Is there an opportunity for that? Of course, you have the basic academy where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4489)|
| 1:14:56| we cover all that for the new officer. But then ongoing, if there's something that comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| in between in-service trainings, let's say that there's been a change in policy or law, either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| one, I refer to that PowerDMS web-based training system earlier. Today, we just put out a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4505)|
| 1:15:12| from the chief, a directive that she had put out to everyone and we're able to put it out to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| the employees, and then they have to sign off on it. We can do the same thing with law. When everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| was building up with COVID several months ago, whether the city or the state were putting out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| those executive orders, we were pushing those out because a lot of them had to do with the way we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| were handling laws and registrations and things of that sort. So I hope to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| if there is a change or an update, then we have the ability to put that out to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| be it a roll call while the officers are present, supervisors putting that out as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| refresher training before everybody hits the street that day, or documenting it through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| the web-based system if there's a change. But there are those kind of foundational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4552)|
| 1:15:59| lessons that are explored first that go through search and seizure and just basic constitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4559)|
| 1:16:07| as we're made aware and they're brought to our attention that there either needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| a refresher on this or there's been a change, then that's how we would push those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4571)|
| 1:16:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| Anyone else? Okay, we'll keep going along then. So I think me and Ms. Middlebrook are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4585)|
| 1:16:32| share this next section. We're going to take a, if you remember our topics for tonight were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| only our initial and ongoing training, but then to speak specifically to our cultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| competency training. Like with the other classes we've talked about, I think it's important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4603)|
| 1:16:52| point out that this training comes up in several places throughout our basic training and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4612)|
| 1:16:58| part of that FTO program and the officer's ongoing training. I don't want it to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| appear as when the academy, they get these nine initial hours, that box is checked and we're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| This portion of training builds a foundation that we will then incorporate into scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| and into other things throughout. So I'll just kind of set the stage as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| how we've got our team together. And then I'm going to let Ms. Middlebrook take it and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| talk about the details of that training. So this here is the picture. There is some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4644)|
| 1:17:31| members of our team that came together for this last recruit class and their cultural competency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4651)|
| 1:17:37| training. So the partnership and the innovation that we have with our cultural competency training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| as you see in the next slide, is nothing new. When we were trying to put a time frame together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| the chief and I both agreed that this was in place long before we came through the academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| that we were doing this training. And the panelists that you'll hear about, we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| doing that decades ago and have tried to be on the leading front of that the best that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4676)|
| 1:18:04| The panelists and the training that we do, again, even going back as far back as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| not only the police department, community leaders, the park commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| several folks have come together to help us improve this over time and try to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| that we're getting there and not just us. So with the 2020 curriculum, again, this is my first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| class. One of the changes that I made, I made two changes to the way that we were doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| and certainly expect there to be more changes going forward as with any of our classes. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| two of the things that I did, one is I have tried in planning forward when we get into scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| based training with our recruits is bringing that cultural competency back into the hands-on portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| so that you didn't just learn in a classroom, but now you're encountering it as you're learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| your and working through your scenarios. The other one that I did is, we'll see in the next slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| I tried to specifically reach out to some folks to help me put together a planning team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4733)|
| 1:19:00| This is nothing that I would dare try to tackle by myself. There's very few classes in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| curriculum I would do that with. But the first thing that I did, we have liaisons within our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| department that are our points of contact for different groups. Whether it is the LGBT community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4749)|
| 1:19:15| whether it is Latino community, we have representatives out there that are officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4755)|
| 1:19:21| that work with these groups. So I pulled those in. At the time, Ms. Ola Blackburn-McBride was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| the interim with PARCC. We had her involved. She played a very intricate part with our last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| cultural competency training. And I reached out to Clarence Vaughn, who was the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| PARCC director, and brought him in. And he has been a tremendous help in building this over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| And then he keeps coming back, even though he's working at the university now supporting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| But another thing that I did is, I actually pulled in, full disclosure, Lieutenant Josh Schaefer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| there is my brother, he actually approached me and said, I would like to be part of this. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| I said, well, what's your idea? And he brought up a very good point. He said, you know, for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| and decades, we have done cultural competency training with the academy, and it's done very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| well. He said, but I feel where we're missing it is we never set the stage. The recruits never hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4806)|
| 1:20:12| from a police officer explaining to them why this is important. They just, the panelists come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| the community leaders come in, the class begins, and nobody has explained the importance of not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| only this in day-to-day life, but specifically from the standpoint of a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| He said, I would like us to first set that stage of hearing from one of their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4828)|
| 1:20:34| hearing from an officer saying, this is what this is for, and how this benefits us not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| with the community, how it can help to keep you safe, how it reduces force, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4839)|
| 1:20:44| I thought it was a great idea. I presented it to the rest of the members on the panel of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| planning group, and they liked it. So, we then took those folks, they got together and developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4847)|
| 1:20:53| our curriculum, or improved upon a curriculum we already had. And I'll let Ms. Middlebrook take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| from there and discuss exactly how that went. Awesome. Thank you, Lieutenant Schaffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4859)|
| 1:21:05| and thank you, council, for including me today and allowing me to talk just a little bit. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4865)|
| 1:21:11| I will give a brief overview of what has been covered previously up through this year in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4871)|
| 1:21:21| cultural competency portion of the academy section of the KPD training. And we can probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4881)|
| 1:21:28| go on to the next slide just so you kind of can have a brief view of what the cultural competency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4888)|
| 1:21:37| training looks like at a glance. So, the cultural competency training for new recruits is spread out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| over three sessions, as Lieutenant Schaffer mentioned earlier. It totals approximately nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| hours. The sessions that they cover are broken down into importance of cultural diversity training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4909)|
| 1:21:56| for law enforcement officers, understanding bias, and then panel presentations and discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4916)|
| 1:22:03| with members of the community. The idea being that conducting the trainings over multiple days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| instead of sitting down and doing this all in one day gives recruits an opportunity to process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| information, consider how it applies to them, and then prepare and think about areas of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| or questions that they want to bring back to the next sessions for the trainers and presenters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| So, session one, the initial session, begins the discussion of the role and necessity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| cultural competency, especially for those providing direct services to members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| There's an overview of how culture is defined, factors that contribute to culture, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| multifaceted nature of culture. So, the idea that every individual identifies with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4962)|
| 1:22:49| multiple cultures. The session discusses how culture influences the way people perceive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| experience, and navigate themselves, others, specific circumstances and situations, and their overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| surroundings. The cultural proficiency continuum is presented and recruits are guided through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4981)|
| 1:23:09| understanding each category of the continuum and its impact, starting with cultural destructiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4989)|
| 1:23:16| and going all the way through to cultural proficiency. Recruits are guided or also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| guided through the Peterson's development model, where the importance of becoming aware of one's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| biases, accumulating knowledge of other cultures, developing the skills to integrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5007)|
| 1:23:35| the knowledge into one's practices and shifting one's attitudes about the values of the value of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| other cultures are explored. During session one, the importance of infusing cultural competency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5020)|
| 1:23:47| into every level of an organization and its services is discussed and recruits are challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5027)|
| 1:23:53| with incorporating some tools for developing their cultural competence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| Later in session two, the discussion expands to focus on biases. Recruits are guided through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5037)|
| 1:24:05| understanding what biases are, how we develop them, and how they impact our understanding of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| and interactions with others. The differences between implicit and explicit biases are also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5051)|
| 1:24:17| discussed in this section. Recruits are challenged to explore what biases they may have and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| factors and or information influence the development of those biases. The session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5063)|

| 1:24:34| adverse effect of bias on the people and communities being served, both generally and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| as it specifically relates to law enforcement. Recruits are again encouraged to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| exploring and challenging their own biases. And then in session three, the third session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5085)|
| 1:24:52| recruits hear from and engage with two diverse panels of community members. And this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| that has gone on, as Lieutenant Shaker mentioned, for a while. And the panel has continued to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| and expand based on the needs of our community, growth in our community, and feedback from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5102)|
| 1:25:10| classes about what information they would like to receive and hear more about so that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| better prepare the next classes to adequately serve our community. So, in 2020, the first panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5115)|
| 1:25:24| included representatives from Latino community, the African American community, the Muslim community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5124)|
| 1:25:30| and the LGBTQ plus communities and allies. And presenters included Claudio Caballero from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5130)|
| 1:25:38| Central Hispano, Clarence Vaughn, who was the previous director of PARC, Sabrina Siddiqui,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5138)|
| 1:25:45| Shelley Clemmons, Ulika Scout, and Leticia Flores. And Leticia is actually a PARC board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5145)|
| 1:25:52| who were there representing the LGBTQ plus community. And Sabrina Siddiqui was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| representing the Muslim community. So, after the presentations by the panelists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| recruits are divided into small groups, and they rotate to tables with panelists to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| questions specific to each represented group. And it's kind of a round-robin type situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5168)|
| 1:26:15| so that each recruit gets the opportunity to engage with each panelist in a smaller setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| and ask more intimate questions and have more intimate discussions. After that, they take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| brief break and come back. And there's a second panel. And the second panel for 2020 included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5185)|
| 1:26:32| representatives from the mobility-impaired, the deaf, vision-impaired, and elder communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| And those panelists were Stephanie Cook, Craig Lemac, Catherine Moore, and Walter Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| Again, after the presentation by the panelists, recruits were able to break up into the small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| groups and do the round-robin discussion with each panelist to have kind of, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5210)|
| 1:26:57| more intimate conversation. Some discussion topics are provided, but of course, they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| able to kind of go where the conversation leads them. But some of the discussion topics that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5222)|
| 1:27:09| were covered are biases and misconceptions that impact each community represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5229)|
| 1:27:15| views of law enforcement within those communities, and some tools and resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| and opportunities for better engagement with communities and building trust within those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| communities. Based on some of the post-session surveys, recruits seem to appreciate gaining more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5243)|
| 1:27:30| information, especially with regards to the disabled communities. They saw the small groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5250)|
| 1:27:36| as being especially helpful. They expressed the desire to continue the cultural competency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5256)|
| 1:27:41| training throughout their careers and actually expressed that they would appreciate a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5261)|
| 1:27:48| more time with the small group discussions. And it has also been suggested that representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| from the Native American and Asian communities be added, and that recruits are interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| in addition to the basic Spanish that they get, in learning some basic sign language to better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| help them communicate. So, that's just kind of a brief overview. And I think there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| additional slides that kind of highlight some of the sample content that you can kind of peruse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5289)|
| 1:28:17| through. And that's kind of a brief overview of what the cultural competency training has looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5297)|
| 1:28:24| like up to this point. And we're excited to kind of continue the conversation and build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5304)|
| 1:28:32| on cultural competency, exploration of biases, and other opportunities to help our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5312)|
| 1:28:39| better engage with the communities that they serve. And I will turn it back over to Lieutenant Schaffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5319)|
| 1:28:47| That is what we have. I guess we'll open it up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5327)|
| 1:29:06| And I should, I think I forgot to point out, and Lieutenant Schaffer may have said, so the initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| session, that was the session that was led by the other Lieutenant Schaffer and Mr. Vaughn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5349)|
| 1:29:18| And the understanding biases also primarily has been led by PART staff, whether it's, I think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5358)|
| 1:29:25| year it was Interim Director McBride. And then again, PART kind of serves a thoughtful role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5365)|
| 1:29:36| in pulling together the panel and inviting folks from the community who are providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| services in our community every day and engaging in the community at a very direct level to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| communicate with officers what they're seeing on the ground level in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| And so we're eternally grateful for Director Vaughn and Interim Director McBride for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5392)|
| 1:29:58| work in putting these sessions together for this past year. Yes, Councilman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5398)|
| 1:30:07| Thank you. So just a question. I understand that we do this with the recruits and that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5407)|
| 1:30:16| some expression of liking this to continue. Do we ever do panels with officers who've been on duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5416)|
| 1:30:25| for a while who may view the world a little differently than a new recruit? Do we ever do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5425)|
| 1:30:32| those panel discussions with more experienced and seasoned officers who, that's just my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5432)|
| 1:30:40| No, no. And good question. I will tell you formally, no. But I can tell you personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| where I've kind of seen that is in some of our community meetings. Before COVID, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5445)|
| 1:30:51| those kind of slowed down a little bit, but the officers were consistently meeting with different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| communities, especially on their beat. And they would serve as that liaison and you would find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| yourself in a group of folks and sometimes the dialogue would go down some of the same paths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| not only dealing with things specific to that community, but just trying to make an understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| and build the bridge between the officer's perception and the community's perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| And a lot of times a very specific part of that community. So I'll tell you no, formally that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5474)|
| 1:31:19| don't have these panels for the senior officers, but I'll tell you informally, I've seen that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5479)|
| 1:31:24| personally happen. But you would hope as you build relationships with people that that's how a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5484)|
| 1:31:30| of this change can come about. But I just wondered if it was something that we had ever considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5490)|
| 1:31:38| as part of the 40-hour continuing education. And I'll just make myself a note, like Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5498)|
| 1:31:44| Mayor McKenzie said too, as we go further down that road. Yes, please. Someone with mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| illness can speak to that. So if I can jump in really quick, I've got Sergeant Britt here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5509)|
| 1:31:55| There are a couple other ways that maybe we do formally do that a little bit. She helps teach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| the CIT portion and it may not be a panel, but it would be people that we will interact with. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5520)|
| 1:32:06| maybe you can expand on that a little bit. So one of the guest speakers we have is Jason Goodman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5526)|
| 1:32:12| and he comes in, he's from the Metro Coalition and talks about his experience with addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5532)|
| 1:32:18| We also have, NAMI usually sends representatives from families or those who have been diagnosed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5538)|
| 1:32:24| with mental illness, and they also engage with those who go through the class. So it's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| panel per se, a group of people, but it is individuals that we bring in from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| who have dealt with these issues personally to give that firsthand view to those in the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5554)|
| 1:32:40| Does that help? Thank you. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| I have a quick question. Is there any pre- or post-assessment that's given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5565)|
| 1:32:54| prior to this, prior to this training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| Yes. I'll let Ms. Middlebrook explain that a little better. I think there may have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| Okay. So based on the information that I have from the last session, there was a post-session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5583)|
| 1:33:15| survey, that last section where I kind of covered what some of the officer, what some of the recruit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| feedback was, came from the post-session surveys that were conducted after the panel. I have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5600)|
| 1:33:27| seen post-session surveys or pre-session surveys from the first two, but that doesn't mean they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| don't exist. I'm still finding things. So I can double check to see if there are pre-tests for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5613)|
| 1:33:42| any of the sessions and if there are post-session surveys for the other two. But I do have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| post-session surveys for the third session specifically. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| I have a question. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| At any point throughout the training, is there a discussion of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5639)|
| 1:34:05| is there a history discussion, history of policing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| Yes. So we, about week three or so, Investigator Jason Booker, who's kind of our historian here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5649)|
| 1:34:16| at the department, he goes back and does the history of policing. We actually go all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| back decades ago or centuries ago to Sir Robert Peel, the father of modern policing in England| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| and how it progresses forward. But then Jason does a good job of specifically to Knoxville Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| Department. So they do get three or four hours on the history of policing and specifically Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5672)|
| 1:34:41| And other classes also go into that. For example, the community-oriented policing class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| we do the history of policing as well. So they get it over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| Well, and so I'm talking about just in terms of the cultural competency. And my point is, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5692)|
| 1:35:00| a lot of people really misunderstand a cultural competency training. And many institutions have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| been doing them wrong for decades. But a cultural competency training is actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5704)|
| 1:35:11| the purpose of it is not to learn about other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| It's not to have people of different cultures to come in and help you better understand people like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5715)|
| 1:35:23| them. When we approach it in that way, that's when we run the risk of reinforcing stereotypes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5723)|
| 1:35:34| and having a very narrow understanding of the differences in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| Of the differences in our community. The purpose of a cultural competency training is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5739)|
| 1:35:46| supposed to be for the participants to understand their own cultural shaping and how it impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5746)|
| 1:35:55| how they're reacting to others they're encountering who they perceive as being outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5755)|
| 1:36:02| of their culture because of whatever cultural marker that is. And so oftentimes for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5762)|
| 1:36:13| foundation of the training has to be on that history. But it also has to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5773)|
| 1:36:22| power relationships in society and the history behind all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| And how those play out in that institution today. So that when that officer is making decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5787)|
| 1:36:36| they're not only applying it to their own personal bias, but they're looking at ways that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5796)|
| 1:36:43| their institution was built to actually not bring about equity. And how can they be a part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5803)|
| 1:36:54| change to reform not only their own personal reactions, but how their institution functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5814)|
| 1:37:02| so that we are promoting justice and equity for all. Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5822)|
| 1:37:09| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| So that's one thing that I'm pushing for us to move in the direction of. I think all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5831)|
| 1:37:16| community participation is great. But I do think that should be a separate piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5836)|
| 1:37:23| And that's more of that community relations, community building piece of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5843)|
| 1:37:30| But for the anti-bias cultural competency training, it's more of an inward look. And it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5850)|
| 1:37:37| more of a developing an understanding of that history and of power relationships in our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5857)|
| 1:37:44| And trying to give officers tools that will better inform their own personal decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5864)|
| 1:37:52| Right. And I think this came up in another conversation that you and I were involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| and you were going to give me some names of some people who had done this. So I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| really appreciate it if you could send me that so we could look over some of that. It'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| You know, in reviewing the training that has been done, a big piece of that is encouraging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| the officers and preparing the officers to be introspective and to assess how their views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5894)|
| 1:38:22| opinions are shaped, and how that impacts their engagement with other folks. I think a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5902)|
| 1:38:28| benefit of the panel has been that the panel allows for the community to come in and share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| with the officers how their communities perceive law enforcement's engagement with their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5913)|
| 1:38:39| Because I think a lot of times we, you know, we all have our perceptions of how others perceive us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| Right. We think that you think I'm this. But to hear somebody say, no, from our perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| this is who you are, maybe helps you be a little more introspective and understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| of how you are actually engaging as opposed to how you think you are engaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5940)|
| 1:39:06| Ms. Millbrook, I'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| This is Seema again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| I'm wondering about looking at class issues, because that is an undercurrent through all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5953)|
| 1:39:19| this. And we make very quick decisions on how people speak, what they're wearing, and assess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5959)|
| 1:39:28| do they have power and influence? How should I interact with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5968)|
| 1:39:33| So, I just think that's an important piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| Yeah, absolutely. I think that, like I said, and this is a continuing and developing process. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5976)|
| 1:39:44| so, I think that we will be always exploring what areas of bias and misperception and inequity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5984)|
| 1:39:55| there are. And so, I appreciate you raising that as an issue to be considered also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=5995)|
| 1:40:01| I think you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6001)|
| 1:40:17| All right. Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| I'll give it back to you. I guess we're wrapping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6022)|
| 1:40:28| Yeah, I guess we'll give it back to you, Vice Mayor. And we appreciate, we really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6028)|
| 1:40:36| the questions. And if you think of any others and you want to email us or bring it up at a later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| date, we certainly do appreciate it because we want to make sure that our training is meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| the needs of our community. Again, it helps keep all of us safe. And that's our ultimate goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6045)|
| 1:40:52| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| No, we appreciate you all. And thank you for making the time and presenting to us and getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| this information together. I think that it's been very informative and helpful for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| Again, I know that we've all been taking notes, the first session as well as this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| And we will look forward to maybe a debrief session at some point. If you guys are like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6069)|
| 1:41:16| me, I've got to go back through all of my notes as well. So, I think that we will have a final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| session where we can maybe go into just a little bit more as far as our overall opinions, thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6080)|
| 1:41:28| any potential suggestions at a later date. So, again, if there's any additional information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6088)|
| 1:41:36| that between now and then as you're going through your notes, please feel free to reach out to Chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| Thomas and her team. I'm sure that they'd be more than willing to provide whatever you need or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| answer additional questions. Appreciate you, Ms. Middlebrook, for jumping in and presenting today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6107)|
| 1:41:53| as well. Council members, are there any other questions or concerns? Any thoughts before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6113)|
| 1:42:00| end our workshop today? I just appreciate us doing this. I think this is very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6120)|
| 1:42:08| Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate it as well. I know I've gotten feedback from community members that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| they wanted more information about how officers are trained and what all goes into training and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6133)|
| 1:42:20| the different components. So, I appreciate that. Thank you. I do have a question. When will the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6140)|
| 1:42:29| next cultural competency training be conducted? Exact dates, I don't have. We actually start our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6149)|
| 1:42:36| next Police Academy September the 14th. So, the next class will begin. And as we stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6156)|
| 1:42:43| this is part of that basic academy. We do this within the first four or five weeks of the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6163)|
| 1:42:50| program. And so, my guess just based on that timeline, mid-October or so, we try to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| early on so that we can build that foundation and use it and build on it throughout the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| So, we actually cover it early on. So, just rough figuring on timelines, I'd say mid-October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| Okay. In the event that there were council members that wanted to observe or participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6188)|
| 1:43:15| in that piece of the training, would that be an issue? No, I don't think so. What I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6195)|
| 1:43:20| do is when our planning team gets together and starts putting together the details for how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| next one will go, I'd like to have, like to know who would be interested at that time and let the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| planning team work with them and kind of get everything set up, whether it was input or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| involvement or just observation. No, we're certainly open to that. I just like to get those logistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| worked out early. Okay, great. All right. If you will, if you guys will just shoot us an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6218)|
| 1:43:43| when you get to that point, anyone who's interested, I know that I would certainly make time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6223)|
| 1:43:49| Yep, that's right. Okay. I have a question. It's about the financing, which budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6229)|
| 1:43:58| pays for the training and about how much does it cost to do it, to put it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6238)|
| 1:44:06| Yes. So, that would probably be a voice question. We have a training budget, but it's mainly used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6246)|
| 1:44:14| for acquiring our instructor certifications and outside training for us so that we can bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| training back. And it's more involved, I think it's incurred, the training is budgeted in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6260)|
| 1:44:30| cost of a new officer. So, I would have to defer to voice on that. We can definitely get that. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6270)|
| 1:44:37| at one point when we were trying to determine how important it was for us to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| with our hiring process to make sure we're getting the right people and make sure our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| training is effective, we thought from beginning to equipping an officer, it was around $110,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6285)|
| 1:44:52| per officer. But as far as just the specific training, I don't know that we've got it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| broken down that well, but I will check with voice and see, Mr. Evans, and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| Okay. Well, as they say, if all hearts and minds are clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6304)|
| 1:45:17| I think that we will call this meeting adjourned. I hope everyone has a great rest of your evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| Thank you all. Bye. Thank you. Meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200806-kpd?start=6322)|
