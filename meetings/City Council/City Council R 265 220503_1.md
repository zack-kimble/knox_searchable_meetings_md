| 2:53:10| And you have not made the poorest parts of Knoxville, Tennessee, the priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10390)|
| 2:53:17| On and on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10397)|

| 2:53:28| I was on the Knoxville-Knox County Food Policy Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10408)|
| 2:53:31| We did a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10411)|
| 2:53:32| Stephanie, you were chairman at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10412)|
| 2:53:34| You brought me into that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10414)|
| 2:53:36| What did we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10416)|
| 2:53:38| We talked to the people who were going to be most affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10418)|
| 2:53:42| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10422)|
| 2:53:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10423)|
| 2:53:44| Now, what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10424)|
| 2:53:45| That information went to the city of Knoxville and it went to the county of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10425)|
| 2:53:49| And has anybody seen anything about that report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10429)|
| 2:53:53| About the food insecurity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10433)|
| 2:53:56| I still live in a food desert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10436)|
| 2:53:58| I still exist in a food desert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10438)|
| 2:54:00| And it's expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10440)|
| 2:54:02| South Knoxville, even with the Kroger's, is going to be a food desert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10442)|
| 2:54:05| Do you know why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10445)|
| 2:54:06| Because there's another problem you haven't been dealing with, and that's the homeless situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10446)|
| 2:54:12| The lack of attention in solving the unhoused problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10452)|
| 2:54:16| Because you've been handing it off to organizations that all they do is profit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10456)|
| 2:54:23| I hate to have to say that, but that's the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10463)|
| 2:54:26| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10466)|
| 2:54:27| Look at the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10467)|
| 2:54:29| There are no results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10469)|
| 2:54:31| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10471)|
| 2:54:34| We've done it to East Knoxville so hard right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10474)|
| 2:54:37| You've got homes that were $35,000 two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10477)|
| 2:54:41| Now they're selling, they got them priced at $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10481)|
| 2:54:44| People are getting pushed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| No rental properties available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10486)|
| 2:54:48| Games being played.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10488)|
| 2:54:50| People are being, it's not even being marginalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10490)|
| 2:54:57| And if this doesn't stop, we're losing our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10497)|
| 2:55:02| They're playing games with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10502)|
| 2:55:06| And it's getting old, people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10506)|
| 2:55:07| It's getting old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10507)|
| 2:55:09| And I don't think you, I have to raise my voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10509)|
| 2:55:13| People that raise their voices means they haven't been paid attention to to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10513)|
| 2:55:20| So you better start listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10520)|

| 2:55:27| And without objection, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10527)|
| 2:55:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10530)|
