| 0:01:10| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| I offer a salute to our nation's flag. Join me in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| Is there anyone here who I did not get any names for public forum prior to the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| However, I do want to, at the work session meetings, we always have public forum at both the beginning and at the end of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=102)|
| 0:01:47| So is there anyone in the audience who would like to address county commission as part of public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| Anybody? Buehler? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| All right. Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| Before we set tonight's agenda, just a couple of general notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| I'm sure my fellow commissioners have had a chance to read through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| During the discussion items and the resolutions, it's relatively light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| but we do have quite a few discussion items towards the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| I'll do my best to kind of get us through those discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| However, if the meeting seems to be getting a little long in the teeth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| we'll still have to be here for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| It may be in our best interest to pull a couple of those discussion items over to next week's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| and we'll probably end up doing so considering we've got six discussion items and at least a presentation as part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=153)|
| 0:02:41| tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| So also, as we begin tonight's meeting, I notice that Superintendent Bob Thomas is in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=163)|
| 0:02:50| Super Bob, thank you for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| I also notice that we have our Sheriff here, Sheriff Tom Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| Thank you, Sheriff Spangler, for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| And Mayor Glenn Jacobs is in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| So thank you, Mayor Jacobs, for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| Is there any other elected officials that are here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| Also, we have a very special VIP in the audience that I'd like to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| Mr. Jackson Hovis is a life scout in Troop 757 who is working on his citizenship and a community merit badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=194)|
| 0:03:23| He was told he needed to attend a public meeting at the scout meeting last night that we were at together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| and I said, Jackson, I will see you here tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| So thank you for joining us, Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=211)|
| 0:03:40| So as we go into tonight's agenda, the additions that we have are all posted on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| but we do need to formally add them to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=227)|

| 0:04:35| 41, excuse me, going back, 7, 16, and 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=275)|

| 0:04:57| Are there any additional items that you'd like pulled, Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=301)|

| 0:05:09| And we believe Cherokee is also here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| Are they not here yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| That actually sounds like a good idea, since we do have a special presentation from Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| So what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| So with tonight's agenda, we'll actually, Dr. Buchanan, we'll move you up to the very front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| And Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| 36 is her number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=329)|

| 0:05:32| So, yeah, it's item 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| It's a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| So it is pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| And we'll be, I don't think I noted that in the form when we were setting the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| But, yeah, item 36 is a discussion item from Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=340)|

| 0:05:49| Could we defer or wait until Cherokee is here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=353)|

| 0:07:22| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| Item number seven, resolution 201, is approving a letter of commitment with train to authorize an investment grade audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| to determine the viability of an LED lighting upgrade for Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| And, Commissioner Gill, I'll look to you on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| I know you had asked for that one to be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| regarding the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=463)|
| 0:07:52| I believe I see Russ approaching the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=472)|
| 0:08:06| Russ Oaks, Knox County Schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Here are my couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| Could you just go over when the last audit was, what schools are going to be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| and what do we do with the outcome if the audit decides that we need to make those upgrades?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| What will be our next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| Well, we've never done an LED audit previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| We've done some lighting audits and some energy management audits over the last ten years at various schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=508)|
| 0:08:36| Our intent is to make sure that whatever we do pays for itself in the energy savings that come out of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=516)|
| 0:08:44| So in years past, we have selectively audited various schools that had the most potential to return savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=524)|
| 0:08:53| I think what we're looking at right now with this audit is to audit all of our schools that don't already have LED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=533)|
| 0:09:00| We're putting LED in our new facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| So anything that we've done in the last two or three years has LED in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| The two new middle schools are all LED equipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| So our intent is to do them all, as well as our stadiums and our parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| And I would expect to be able to save not just in energy costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| but also in maintenance costs, you know, as we will have to replace fixtures and light bulbs a whole lot less frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=565)|
| 0:09:34| You answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| And I'll let, would you like to, I'll go ahead, will you make the motion on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| So moved, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| So we have a motion for approval from Commissioner Gill with a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| Item number 14, resolution 208, is approving a lease agreement with Knox County Rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| for property located at New Hope Weld Elementary School with annual rent in the amount of $300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| for a term of six years with the option to lease for five additional consecutive terms of one year each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| I was the one who pulled that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| I just had kind of a simple question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| I'm not sure if this was an incremental location for the rescue squad or if we were, if they were adding services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=618)|
| 0:10:26| or just taking our relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| Can you tell me just a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| It's not, it's more of a rescue mission than a school mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| Well, I really can't, I can't tell you too much about their mission, but what I can tell you is this is an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| that we've had in place for the last 11 years, and they've been using this property for the last 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| And I'm not sure exactly what trucks and what response apparatus they have there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| but what this does is it basically re-ups that agreement for a total of another 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=648)|
| 0:10:55| And that's my basic question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| I wasn't sure if this was a renewal or if this was something that was incremental in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| Yes, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| It is used for storage, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| No services, just storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Maybe a little training, but that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| I'll entertain a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Motion for approval from Commissioner Daley with a second from Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| Item number 16, resolution 210, approving a grant contract in the amount of $205,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| with the Tennessee Department of Education for the provision of creating a district-led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| educator preparation program to support the career and technical education CTE teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| pipeline requires a local match of $128,131.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| We have the motion for approval from Commissioner Anders with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Was that Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| John, would you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| And Commissioner Gill, I know you were asked to have this one pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| So, Mr. Risewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| You know, first of all, let me say that we look to build our career and technical education programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| And this was just an opportunity to highlight the work that this program will build, not only in a regional capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=726)|
| 0:12:16| And I just wanted to make sure we could just explain that state initiative, the location, the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| This is just such an opportunity we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| So that was the reason I pulled it, so we can get additional information on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Yes, we're excited about the opportunity as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| I'm excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| I think it's one of those things that, you know, we know teacher shortages are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| And we know, especially in the area of career and technical education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| most of the time when we're asking professionals to step into the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| lots of times they're taking pay reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| I mean, think of a registered nurse who may come and teach a health science class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| They're usually taking a reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| And then on top of that, we have this licensure requirement because they're not certified teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| So they usually have a three-year window where they make that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| So it's not surprising that there's not a lot of the programs around like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| So the state actually approached us for the East Tennessee side of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| because there was no one who was certifying any longer CTE teachers in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| So they came to Knox County and gave us the opportunity to become our own educational prep provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| Unlike universities like UT, Carson Newman, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| So what this grant does is it provides us the opportunity to build that program out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| and get that approval from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| Once we have that, which we have a two-year window to get that done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| then we'll be able to, in essence, certify CTE teachers through our own programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| We'll be put under the same scrutiny, again, as any other university or college that does that certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| But it'll allow us to do that for CTE teachers, which there's a great shortage for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| And, John, it's good to see you're fully embracing no shave November early here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| I was curious if the school had cut the razor budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| Anything we can do to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| This motion is probably before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=846)|

| 0:14:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Item number 21, resolution 215, is approving a grant contract in the amount of $13,307| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=854)|

| 0:14:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| Can I have a motion for this one, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=878)|

| 0:14:50| Would you lean forward or pull the microphone towards you just a little bit closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=893)|

| 0:14:55| Maria Black, 500 West Church Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Commissioner Gill, I think you had asked to have this one pulled, so we want to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| You know, I'm always excited about any new things coming to the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| It's going to be the main library, or we're going to have computers out at different locations, or do we know at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=907)|
| 0:15:16| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| The grant is for replacement of the audiovisual system at the East Tennessee History Center classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=918)|
| 0:15:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| We have a classroom in the McClellan Collection on the third floor, and that equipment has aged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| And we had a recent storm with a power outage, which sped up the process and the need to replace it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| So this grant came at a good time for us to be able to do that through the grant process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| And we also have a microfilm reader at both the McClellan Historical Collection and the Knox County Archives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=943)|
| 0:15:51| that we are replacing with a reader-printer-scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| And then we are adding a reader-printer at the reference department at the Lawson McGee Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| And, you know, people may say, well, why do you need microfilm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| Well, we have about 40,600 microforms in the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| The majority of those are at the McClellan Historical Collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| They're one-of-a-kind in many instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| That's the only format available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| And so it's important that when that equipment ages out that we're able to replace it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| and we're replacing it with the newest equipment that we have available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| So we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| So are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Is there any additional discussion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Item number 27, Resolution 406, is approving a contract for on-call geotechnical consulting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| and material testing services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| Could I have a motion for approval, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| Actually, yeah, we're going to need to send it forward with no recommendation unless you've got a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| I actually do have two names, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| It's GEI Consultants and Wood Environment and Infrastructure Solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| My apologies about not having that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| This week earlier caught us off guard or we would have had it on prior to, so my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Ms. Clerk, have you got that exactly what he said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| Could you go ahead and restate those two names, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| And I've got a copy here with all the spilling that I can give as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| And if you could give that to the clerk's office so we can document for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| It will be added to the BOC meeting next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Move to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| We have a motion from Commissioner Jay to send forward no recommendation and a second from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| Before we vote on that, I think I'd ask you also just to provide a little bit of insight as to what this contract is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| When I see geotech, the first thing that came to my mind is sinkhole stuff, but I know it's probably a lot more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| So if you don't mind, just tell us a little bit about the scope of service for the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| and exactly what they're going to be doing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| We use these consultants for two primary reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| One, like you said, the sinkhole remediation like we did at Green Hill or Greenwell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| Also, slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| We have a lot of slope failures in the county, so we have to have a little bit of expertise that my staff currently doesn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| And the other function we do is construction materials testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| When we pave streets or install sidewalk or concrete box culverts or any things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| we have to verify, do destructive testing on some of that material to verify that the material placed was in conformance with the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1109)|
| 0:18:37| So both these providers have the technical services and the lab services to do both those outlets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| And we did choose two vendors this time to have a little flexibility, whereas in the past we've just had one vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| And you had mentioned slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| Are these some of the vendors that we have when we have, say, a construction site that we've approved a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| and we're worried about it impending like our slope rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| Would this kind of fall into that scope of service as well in terms of consulting and saying, yes, you can do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| Or would you guys be consulting with them even when it gets down to, say, plan approvals over at the planning commission site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| Is that kind of part of this as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| We could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Like the most recent incident we have, that's actually out off Ebenezer Road near Bex Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| There's some tension cracks forming in the slope there along the five-lane section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| So we brought them in and they're giving us some analysis on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| So they'll be looking at operational things like that as well as things that may develop during the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Are there any other questions for Mr. Stone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| And to restate it, because we stated it earlier, it's to send forward with no recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| Pending, Mr. Stone is going to give us the names of these two vendors, which will be added into the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| and then will appear on our formal agenda for next week's BOC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| So with that said, all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| Item number 32, resolution 901, is approving an amendment to Knox County contract number 19-221| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1211)|
| 0:20:19| with Evertonium, formerly Sword and Shield Enterprise Security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1219)|
| 0:20:28| for the provision of information technology monitoring services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| which amendment adds services to the contract for the Knox County Information Technology Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| in the amount of $156,800 for the term of December 1st, 2019 to May 31st, 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1237)|
| 0:20:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Hey, Zach, if you could please approach the podium and I guess be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| I know when I saw this, I remembered the sale of Sword and Shield when it hit the paper, I guess, last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| You saw my question on the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1259)|

| 0:21:01| If you could formally state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1261)|

| 0:21:05| Knox County IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| This is really just amending and cleaning up an existing contract that we already have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| The name change is part of the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| Also, a rate change that will go into effect by 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1279)|

| 0:21:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| And Dr. Buchanan, Commissioner Carringer just whispered to me that Cherokee is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| so this seems like a pretty good stopping point if you'd like to go ahead and begin the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| And I want to thank – I believe this presentation was brought to us by Commissioner Gill and Commissioner Carringer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| who wanted kind of an update on how our indigent care program was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1313)|
| 0:22:18| Dr. Buchanan, the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| So we have a PowerPoint presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| We're also passing out the same information in a paper form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| So you all – we agreed to and you'd asked for quarterly reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| so this will be the first quarter of this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| And looking at the data from the Knox County Medical Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| which we played with changing its name from the indigent care program because nobody –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| it's not a very respectful name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| So Knox County Medical Program fits what the program's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| So what you – I'll let you take some time to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| If you could go to the next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| So that first graph is enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| So that first graph is enrollment in the first quarter of the fiscal year from 2016 to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1390)|
| 0:23:19| And as you can see, enrollment changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| I'll remind you that the maximum enrollment is 1,100 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| As you can see, we haven't been near that number in quite some time on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| We have at times been up there back earlier, but we currently haven't been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| And you can see in the last two years, last two fiscal years, that enrollment has been down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| not just this year, but – and Cherokee has not come back and asked us to change that cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| So that hasn't happened, so it's stayed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| And then the next graph – next slide, please – shows emergency department visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| And these are from what we billed by emergency rooms for those visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| And so you see the emergency department visits also vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| And have been a little lower compared to – I mean, as enrollment has changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| emergency department visits have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| What we haven't seen is enrollment dropping or enrollment kind of getting flat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| and more people going to the emergency room than they were in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| So we're going to continue to watch this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| This is just the first quarter of this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| If you flip this page over to the second page, you'll look at hospital days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| And hospital days simply are that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| They're full hospital days, and an ER visit equals a third of a hospital day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1477)|
| 0:24:45| So the hospitals all send us that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| and we pay them based on the formula out of the total amount in that budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| for the number of days they provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| It's a percentage based on the number of days they provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| And you can see variation in that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| It goes up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| We thought it was important to look at the historical perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| and not just look in one little window of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| And then right below that, Commissioner Carringer had asked for information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| on how much we pay specialists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| And this is a summary of what we pay for specialty care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| And specialty care is everything from the cardiologist to the oncologist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1523)|
| 0:25:31| and all those other specialty-ologist guys and gals that are out there taking care of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| So this is not dermatology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| This is not cosmetic surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| So you can see that we pay a percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| just like your insurance company pays a percentage to the doctor when you go see the doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| We pay a percentage to the specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| And, again, that's based on that total amount of money that's in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| And so it's a weighted amount based on how much they pay us or how much they bill us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| And we pay them based – it kind of ends up being how many people are putting their hand in the cookie jar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1561)|
| 0:26:08| and how big is their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| That's kind of how we determine how much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| So it's a weighted percentage of what they've billed us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| a weighted percentage of what chunk of money is in that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| So, as you can see, the money went down to the percent went down that the specialists are being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| So that's kind of an average – or not total, but average percent of all the specialists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| So any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| That's kind of the – that's the hospital outpatient specialty care side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| Dr. McKinnon, I've got one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| With the emergency department visits, those are all counted as each visit stands on its own as a visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1601)|
| 0:26:49| Is there any data – I'm just – what my curiosity popped up is how many are folks that maybe the same person visited twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1609)|
| 0:26:59| I guess that would be – are these all unrelated visits or are these different visits for the same person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| I guess I'm just curious if there's a percentage that might be folks who maybe had to go to the ER two or three times during a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1625)|
| 0:27:14| Kevin Barton, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| This is just a cumulative of how many times every individual has visited the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| We are now breaking that out, that data out this year to find out are we having the same person multiple times, multiple ERs, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1644)|
| 0:27:33| I mean, that would obviously be good data too if you need to get a social worker or a case manager working on them if you see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| Yes, sir. We are starting to examine that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| Okay, all right. So you're pulling that data out this year and you may be able to look back – when you get to January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| we'll be able to look back at the past quarter and if you see people who need any extra help, is that kind of the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| Correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| So that will probably be something next quarter when Dr. Buchanan comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| When you all are here, I'll probably ask that question and say, hey, how's it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| If that's fair, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| All right, cool. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| So the other piece of paper that you have in front of you is data from Cherokee Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| and we asked them to tell us about visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| And so the top line, patient with office visits, those are individuals who had a visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| And the second line is what we would call a duplicated visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| So that's – people might go more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| If you have hypertension, you know that you see your doctor more than one time a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| If you have diabetes, you see your doctor more than one time a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| If you have a chronic condition and then you get sick, you go see your doctor again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| So those are just multiple visits by the same person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| You ask for the top diagnoses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| We have the top ten on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| No surprise, hypertension is in the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| It's in the top for the general population as well, so that's not surprising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| And diabetes is right below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| And, again, those two share top billing for everybody across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| And then when we look at prescriptions, we can see that prescriptions continue to be dispensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| at a relatively similar rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| If you do the math, it's about four to five prescriptions per person based on the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| that had prescriptions during that quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| So we haven't seen, again, any caps on prescriptions or enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| We'll continue to work with our partners at Cherokee to address any efficiencies that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| and, again, look at our data and address efficiencies such as addressing the social determinants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| or the drivers of health that keep people going back to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Any questions for Dr. Freeman from Cherokee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| And if there's anything else you all would like to see in this quarterly report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| just shoot me an email and we'll look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| The way we're collecting the data and organizing the data now is relatively new to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1798)|
| 0:30:05| I know that sounds a little bit crazy, but we went from big, giant spreadsheets of written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| handwritten stuff to finally transitioning to electronic databases that we can search with some limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| So that's a great presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| Dr. McKenna, I would ask if you could get a copy of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| I see a light from Commissioner Carringer to the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| I've already written notes on mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| But if you could get an electronic or email a copy to the clerk's office so that it can be part of the records for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| Have you got a copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| She's got a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| She's got the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| She's got a PowerPoint, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| That doesn't have Cherokee's report, so I can send that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| You have a paper copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| You want the electronic one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| She's got Cherokee's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| Then we'll cover there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Commissioner Carringer's got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Well, first I just want to thank you, Dr. Buchanan and Cherokee, for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| This was a discussion item that we wanted to make sure that we let the citizens of Knox County know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| that all of us as county commissioners took this past budget to heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| and we wanted to make sure we were staying up on it because of the cut that was being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| So we wanted to make sure that we were all doing the correct thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| and keeping track on it to make sure we're being responsible to our citizens out there that need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1877)|
| 0:31:25| And I do like the changing of the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| I think that was a very positive move on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| So I just wanted to thank you all very much for coming tonight and presenting this to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| and then just to ask if Cherokee, if there's anything that you would like to say to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| or for the community to know or any of that, I would like to give you a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1905)|
| 0:31:59| I'm Dennis Freeman, Cherokee CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| Well, we appreciate the added attention to the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| You know, this is a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| You know, it wasn't easy to take the cut, I can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| You know, we've operated at a deficit over the first quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| and about 30 percent of it is probably attributed to this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| We haven't limited enrollment, and I think you can see from some of the data that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| some of the referrals, you know, some of the pharmacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| we've really looked really, really hard at trying to control the cost every way we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| We've limited some of the staff costs, so we've cut the administrative cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| So we've really, really worked hard to try to stay within the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| So I appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Dr. McKenna to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Sorry, just one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| Give credit to Commissioner Schoonmaker for asking us to change the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| He did do that a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| In addition to that, getting this volume, I know it looks simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| but probably not January is when we're going to be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| We'll probably need a month to do the data gathering and get the final bills in and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| So February is more likely when we'll be able to bring another report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| Okay, what I'll do, I'll look to Commissioner Carringer and Drusilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| if you all could kind of just make a little pencil note to invite Dr. McKenna back in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| Because I'd be surprised if it's not up some because the holidays bring on a lot of other issues and also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2012)|
| 0:33:42| But thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| We want to make sure that everybody is being held accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| and that we're providing the best that we can for our citizens in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2027)|
| 0:33:55| Okay, Madam Clerk, moving on to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Next item, I think we're at 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| Or 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Yes, item 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| It's resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| It is approving an extension of agreement for sale and purchase between Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| and Marble Alley Development LLC for Marble Alley's purchase of 13 parcels of real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| collectively known as the State Street property to extend the due diligence period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| for up to three consecutive 12-month periods for the remaining five parcels for Marble Alley to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Gill with a second from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| I know Commissioner Skinmaker's line is already on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| I'd like to ask Matt Myers if he could come down to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| and basically just verify some information that I was able to ascertain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2086)|
| 0:34:57| In looking at this, Marble Alley was first established in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| You can just say yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| 2009, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| And then they purchased part of the county-owned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| There's a balance of five tracts that face State Street starting at the corner of Union and going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2111)|
| 0:35:19| I guess, is that north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| North along State Street up to the Marble Alley development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| And the developer was given the rights to have a two-year contract to delay purchasing the property for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2128)|
| 0:35:38| They got another two-year extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Say yes if I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| They got a third two-year extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| They've gotten a fourth two-year extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| And in 2017, this body gave them another two-year extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| So a total of ten years, Knox County's been holding this property for the developer to purchase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2154)|
| 0:36:02| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| That's a fair statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| But in the original option contract, there were two additional option periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| That I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| So Knox County's been sitting on this, our own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| We've been holding it now for ten years waiting for a developer to purchase it from Knox County at a predetermined rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2180)|
| 0:36:28| Now, based on the contract, they've had to pay a $15,000 a year option for us to give them that opportunity to purchase it at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2188)|
| 0:36:42| I guess my question is, after ten years, I would think, and this is if you look at the contract that was just handed to you by procurement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2202)|
| 0:36:54| the county's sitting on a million dollars' worth of real estate that in ten years the developer can't purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| or whatever hasn't seen the need to purchase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| So I guess my question is, after ten years, you know, if you can't do it in ten years, why we want to give them another three years to extend this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2226)|
| 0:37:16| I mean, this is not on the tax rolls right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| The contract ends December 31st of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| I say we need to just stop this contract come January, put it out for bid, and let somebody else buy this property development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2246)|
| 0:37:35| and let's get it on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| I mean, after ten years, if you can't get financing to buy five parcels of property, I mean, I don't know what the reason is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2257)|
| 0:37:44| but does anybody see any logic in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| Why would you want to just continue, continue, continue to delay on property that we own that we need to turn over for development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| We've got a few lights that came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| I saw Commissioner Anders' light come on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Or was it Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Miss Gill was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Commissioner Gill, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Buzz is here if we need additional questions, observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| Buzz Goss of Marble Alley, if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Here's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| John had proposed a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Commissioner Anders' light came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| I'm going to allow Commissioner Anders to respond, and then we'll have Buzz come down and talk to this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| if that sounds appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| So go ahead, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Well, I wanted to, I didn't see Buzz in the back, but I wanted to give a little historical on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| I mean, if you look at the dates that we went into contract in 2009 and knew what the property looked like prior to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2309)|
| 0:38:37| and seen the finished product on the park that we've already dealt with on, this is not a simple task in a downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2317)|
| 0:38:46| And I don't, Buzz can speak to it if he chooses to, but this was, 2009 was kind of a dismal economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2326)|
| 0:38:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| And what has already come out of the ground over there has been very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| And I think the concept plan has changed a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| The needs downtown have changed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| And so I think it's, you know, if you're going to cut them off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| I think it's fair to give them a little bit more extension to say, hey, January, you see, I know it's a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| but if you're going to terminate or not choose to not approve an extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| I think giving them an opportunity to figure out what that final concept is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| But the history of this spot, what we have now versus what we had in 2009 is quite impressive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| and nobody else downtown has done new from the ground building like he has done down there in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| and brought that many people down there in a new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| So I can, Buzz has done a great job down there, and I'm in favor of supporting this extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2383)|
| 0:39:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| I'll go ahead and call on Buzz if you'd like to go ahead and approach and kind of give us an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| And when you approach the podium, if you could just please formally state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Buzz Goss, 110 West Summit Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| May I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| The podium is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you've raised some reasonable concerns, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| To give you the history of this, this really did start in 2009 when we were in the depths of the recession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| when there was nothing really available to get anything done in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| And so it took quite a while to get the first phase done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| And what we see down there now was it's hard to really believe that today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| but at the time it was a game changer in Knoxville because to get a deal like that done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| took equity from places like Washington, D.C., and Tulsa, Oklahoma, and California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| but also get lenders to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| You know, downtown Knoxville was the market to believe in and to bet on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| And so we got that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| And while we started construction on that in 2014, we really didn't finish it until 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| And at that time, what that project created was it proved a market, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2467)|
| 0:41:14| It said, hey, listen, Knoxville is a market that you can trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| Downtown Knoxville is a market that you should invest in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| Well, since that time, there's been a number of things that have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| One, construction costs have gone through the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| Two, we've had some other competing properties come online, or not come online but be announced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| And so we had to negotiate, right, and navigate those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| For instance, right now we have two things that are getting ready to come out of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| That's Supreme Court site with Rick Dover and his group, Bristol out of Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| and Lee Birch and Daniel Smith who are doing the stockyard lofts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| Well, I still face the problem of convincing, you know, lenders from different markets that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2512)|
| 0:41:59| hey, we can absorb all these units coming online at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| Well, we can't, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| It's not a question of can we fill them up, but we can't fill them up all at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| So that caused me and my investors to sort of look at, okay, when did it make sense to get started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| The other thing that's going on is we're the best site in downtown Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2537)|
| 0:42:25| to help facilitate the development above the State Street parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| And I've spoken to a few of the commissioners about this in the recent past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| And so it made sense also to wait until we saw who was going to be the next administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| And I've had conversations with my current mayor-elect about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| And so we have bigger plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| Marble Alley is not just a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| It's a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| You know, the history of Marble Alley is that, well, the history in downtown is alleys had names, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| And Marble Alley was a neighborhood because that alley had a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| And it has a great history to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| And what we're really trying to do is create a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| And it just takes time to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| So reasonable concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| Without the context and the history, I think you've expressed your opinion, and it's a reasonable opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2591)|
| 0:43:19| But I think if you know the history, then perhaps it's worth giving us a little more time to try to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| By the way, we haven't asked for it for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| You know, the current building down there pays $83,000 a year in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| Well, before that, it paid zero, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| And thus far, I've written checks personally for $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| And then we paid another $2.2 million, I think, on the property that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| So we put a lot of money back in the coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| But, again, your concern is reasonable, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| But I hope you understand where we're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| And it's not that we're trying to take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| It just takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| These things are big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| They're complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| It takes a lot to navigate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| Do you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| And I just wanted to acknowledge the work that Matt Myers put into this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| and the corrections and observations that were made through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| And I just need to acknowledge that and the work out of our own legal department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| And we appreciate the capacity building that exists on the forefront when Marble Alleys began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| And I think we believe the level of saturation for downtown really is fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| And what we have not, what we forgot is what downtown looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| See, I think what we have forgotten is the level of development in the last 15 years that have occurred to build a better city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2683)|
| 0:44:54| And we appreciate the work that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| I'll go back to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| And then we've got Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you spoke earlier, so I do want to, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| But go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| Mr. Goloski, do you tell me what was the total investment in Marble Alley, the section that's been developed to date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| The Marble Alley lofts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| We invested $36 million and change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| And you said that that produces about $83,000 in annual taxes currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| Currently, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| And you purchased the land during that option agreement for $2.2 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| I don't remember the exact number, but it was north of $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| But that was inside that $36 million total investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| How many projects have you been involved in either as the developer, the architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| or the primary designer in downtown, in the sort of core CBID downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2746)|
| 0:45:54| North of 2 million square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| And how many projects roughly is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| Twenty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| I mean, Marble Alley is the largest, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| But it's not the only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| We also have the Sturkey Building with Lee Birch and a number of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| Well, I want to thank you for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| I want to lend my support for this extension for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| One, I have a lot of context here in the sense of what downtown used to be like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| Like Commissioner Gill said, I was the second resident of the Sturkey Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| and I've known Mr. Goss for close to 15, 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| And it was a ghost town, and you could shoot a cannon through downtown most days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| and never hit anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| And it takes a lot to take a lot of risk, to take a lot of leaps of faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| and to risk a lot of capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| I also developed a building downtown, the Ely Building at Church Street and Market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| and everything I thought about downtown development took three or four times as long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| just to restore a historic building, much less build one out of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| And it does take a long, long time to do these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| and I think we have a partner in development here with a 20-year-plus track record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2828)|
| 0:47:15| with a lot of projects under the belt, a lot of investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| and a visionary that has helped really transform our downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| bring tax dollars to the table, bring residents to the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| And we ought to give a little leeway there before we start thinking about new partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| We have a plan, we have somebody with a plan, and we have somebody with a vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| and we ought to give them a little leeway to understand that capital and risk takes time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| and vision takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| And it's okay to have a little bit more time, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Well, thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| I'd like to add, perhaps, that I moved downtown in 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| I bought my first building in 1992.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| So I have been doing this a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| But I'm also not just in downtown, but I'm within a mile of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| I own an apartment complex in South Knoxville that I bought in 2007, absolute worst time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| But what's nice about that is that South Knoxville has become a very desirable neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| but you can get a two-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath unit from me over there for $875,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| Downtown's expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| But it's hard to provide that kind of housing in downtown because it's so expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| Hey, Buzz, if you don't mind, I'm going to recognize Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Mr. Giles, this is taxpayer's money we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| This property's worth a million dollars that we could probably sell to some other developer downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2912)|
| 0:48:40| My concern is that three years is, you know, what could happen to you in three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| and we're sitting on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| and who's to say in three years you're not going to come back and ask for another three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| Well, we could make this the third and final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| Well, we can put that in the contract that it's the third and final one, and I'll support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| But right now I wouldn't support it because you keep coming back asking and asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| and I appreciate what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| But who's to know in three years we're going to have new commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| Some of us will be new commissioners maybe or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| but, you know, it's to the point of when are we going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| And if you're willing to put that in contract that this will be your last three-year extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| I'm willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| You know, I could have said six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| I could have said 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| I just know how fungible the process is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| I mean, it's expensive these days to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| Well, I'd like to amend the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| It takes a lot of equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| This next deal will cost the same as the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| Amend the motion to no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| So you've amended or have you actually made a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| I'm sorry, substitute motion for no recommendation so we can discuss Mr. Goss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2987)|
| 0:49:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| Goss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| Goss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| G-O-S-S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| G-O-S-S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| It is Goss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| He has agreed to say this would be his final three-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| So Commissioner Daley has amended the first motion was a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| The second substitute motion you proposed is to send forward with no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| just so if the commissioner wanted to either research or get more information for next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| or the possibility of him making a change to that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| I'm just resetting your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| Is that agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| I think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| I need a second on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| So I have a second from Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| Can we, on the motion that you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| I know we have the substitute motion, but then we're going to, as I recognized you as the second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| I'll let you talk to it, but then I've also got to get to Commissioner Smith and then back to Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| And then on this new paperwork, it's a two-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| The new that they just put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| Isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Am I reading that the right way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| For 2021?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| It's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| The resolution says three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| No, not the resolution which you were handed by the purchasing department prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| Oh, I didn't get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| It's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| It says I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| Is that three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| Then I'm reading it too fast here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| It's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| So it's three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| That motion is now on the floor, but I still want to continue the discussion before we get to the vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| Excuse that substitute motion, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| We have a developer, one of the first to believe in our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| One of the first to bring a big project to our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| I think it is unwise to try to move this into the unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| I think given time, Buzz will do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| He was one of the first to believe in our downtown, and he was one of the first people to make our downtown start to turn into what it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3117)|
| 0:52:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| I echo what Randy just said, so we're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| Commissioner Schoonmaker, back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| I don't think there's any question on your development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| What you've done down there has been phenomenal because that property was originally supposed to be a justice center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| The jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| But I guess my question is, when you came to us in 2015, excuse me, 2017, and asked for an extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3149)|
| 0:52:39| if you really didn't think that was going to be a viable deal, why didn't you just say, can you just give me five more years at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3159)|
| 0:52:46| Do you see where the perception is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| It's like you're just stringing us along, and it's, you know, they've added on to the State Street parking garage now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| That property there can be used for something in generating revenue for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| And that's just the whole point of this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| So I hope we can do some more due diligence and discuss this again next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3185)|
| 0:53:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Is there any other discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| Once again, restate what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| There was a substitute motion made with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| I just wanted to, in clarity, if this motion fails, we fall back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| I was about to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| If this motion fails, the motion that will be on the table is the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| which I believe was first and seconded by Commissioner Gill and Smith, and that one would then be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| I have one other question on this property, and I don't know if Matt can answer this or Risk Management can answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| but because we own the property now, those five separate parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| if there's something, an accident that happens on that property right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| has Knox County been liable for anything that happens on those five parcels and has been for these past few years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3239)|
| 0:54:08| I would obviously defer to Risk Management on that, but I believe that would be the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3248)|

| 0:55:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| Before I announce the results, does any of the commissioners wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3318)|
| 0:55:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| The noes have it on an eight to two vote, so we are now back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| That was before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| We had not yet voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| There is an opportunity for additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| Just to confirm, Mr. Law Director and Risk Management, that if someone does get hurt for $15,000 a year, we are going to be liable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3340)|
| 0:55:50| We will be liable for any property that Knox County owns for as long as they own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| Right now or in the future or whatever, yes, we will be liable for Knox County's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3363)|
| 0:56:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| The motion before us was first by Commissioner Gill, second by Commissioner Spitz, which was for approval of R-19-11902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3368)|
| 0:56:17| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| Could we have another roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| Just two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Just two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Then the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| I proclaim the ayes to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| No need for a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| Item number 34, resolution 903, to recommend that the Knox County schools consider requiring the installation of bidirectional amplifiers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3398)|
| 0:56:48| BDAs, in all new Knox County schools during construction and the testing of all existing schools for compliant radio communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3408)|
| 0:56:56| and providing for the installation of BDAs in all schools where compliance is not currently met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| I'm going to look to Commissioner Biggs on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| He's the one who brought this to us before I even asked for a motion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| If you could kind of tell us a little bit about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| It's almost a discussion item slash kind of thing, if you could kind of tell us about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| So, basically, do you want to know what a BDA is, or do you just want to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| Yeah, if you could kind of, what is a BDA, what's the history on this thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| It's also potentially maybe awkward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| It's not quite the right word, but I guess we're trying to send a message to the schools that we take this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| We know for a fact that legally we cannot direct the school board to do exactly what they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3458)|
| 0:57:44| but this might send a message that it would be perceived favorably on our end, especially as it relates to funding and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| So, if you could kind of clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| With three new schools on the horizon, I thought that it would be good if I brought this before the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| that some of the schools may not be as compliant in Knox County that we would like for them to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| and this is just to make everyone aware that we would like for the BDAs to be implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| because to put it in layman's terms, if you have Wi-Fi at your house and you're downstairs or upstairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3487)|
| 0:58:14| and you can't get that signal when you're on another level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| you have a little booster box that a lot of people plug into their outlet at home, and it lets you get signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3497)|
| 0:58:24| What this is, is basically whenever we're having emergency communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| whether it's the Knox County Sheriff's Office, rural metro, priority ambulance, whatever that may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| if there's something going on in an emergency situation at that school and they can't get communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| a BDA would basically give them the ability to get those communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3518)|
| 0:58:45| I tried to kind of show, I hope everyone read the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| the reason we're not getting adequate communications is because of the weatherproofing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3529)|
| 0:58:57| and things of that nature that's over our windows don't allow it to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| So I hope that was it. I'll have more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| Well, I think when Commissioner Biggs called me to say, hey, I wanted to add this item to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| I guess what I summed up, once again, Hugh terms are even lower than layman's terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3550)|
| 0:59:16| So I said, it's my understanding that we kind of had unintended consequences of some of the weatherproofing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| that we've done to the windows, which blocks some of these signals from getting outside of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| And these BDAs would basically help kind of push important signal out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| that might not have gotten through the windows in so many other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| And just for example, we have a BDA here located on the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| I've talked with Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| There's ways of installation that it would not void the warranty to our roofs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| There's ways to put them in that it really, you almost wouldn't even know it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| It's not a very large system, but it would benefit us greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| In our new schools, you know, I think it's a good idea to implement those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| Okay, I'll look to Commissioner Anders who probably knows something or two about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| Yeah, so the BDAs, I mean, I'll give you an example, and it can be costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| I mean, there's no question, but as you move forward in building large buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| so Covenant Health and Children's Hospital expansions are getting BDAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| All of UT's buildings are getting BDAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| And it's partially due to the insulation, the density of the buildings, the metal, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| But it's also due to the digital radio systems and the digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| Everything has went from analog to digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| And those signals are not as strong in the basements and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| So I think it's, this is a non-binding resolution asking the school system to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| And hopefully that we could possibly look at grant funding, research grant funding for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| Because it's a serious public safety issue if fire EMS or police can't get in and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3648)|
| 1:00:56| communication in and out of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| And so this is just kind of forward thinking on pre-construction, at the pre-construction time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| to invest whatever it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| You know, if you go to some schools like a Bell-Morris that's smaller, less dense, older windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| probably wouldn't require a BDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| But if you go out to a Hardin Valley or a Gibbs Middle School, it may have complications with that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3674)|
| 1:01:22| So this is a non-binding resolution asking the schools to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| And because we obviously can't tell them what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| But it can be a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| And the new construction, like I said, going on downtown, there's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| hundreds of thousands of dollars being invested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| So if it's important to them, it should be important to us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| And then isn't Motorola the primary company that builds these units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| There's multiple companies that build them, but Motorola is who we have our radio system with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| But you would have to RFP it and put it out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| It's a substantial investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| But I would imagine that there's more BDA vendors than just Motorola.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Well, do we need to have any kind of added verbiage that says whatever the company is that provides these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3724)|
| 1:02:13| that it is 100% compatible with our new radio system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| It will be a P25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| It would have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| But this is just a non-binding resolution asking schools to consider BDAs, essentially, is all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| But it's doing it pre-construction since we got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| But it's a thought that needs to be considered as we build these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| Yeah, Mr. Oaks, would you like to go ahead and weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3761)|
| 1:02:50| Yeah, I just wanted to share a point of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| And I'm sure some of you already know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| The BDAs and distributed antenna systems are part of the international building code that this body adopted in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3776)|
| 1:03:06| And so we're required to consider those in all new construction, and we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| As a matter of fact, we installed BDA in the Enskip Elementary School when we did the addition over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3791)|
| 1:03:18| even though it was not required under the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| So we're already looking at it and moving in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| We do need to do an analysis of the entire system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| And, you know, from what I understand, that will probably be the least expensive part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| But we'll look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| And I think as we look at it and go forward, it will be a multiyear process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| It won't be something that can happen overnight just because of the expense of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| Thank you, Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| Is there any additional discussion on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| We have not had an official motion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| So I'll look to Commissioner Biggs to make the motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| Second from Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| Item number 35 is Ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| It's amending the Knox County Code Appendix A zoning, Article 2, Section 2.20, specific terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| Article 5, Section 5.38.03, uses permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| and Article 4 to add a new Section 4.106 standards for the use on review approval of microbreweries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3864)|
| 1:04:31| in the CN neighborhood commercial district and subsection 4.106.01 minimum requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3871)|
| 1:04:39| to define microbreweries and identify them as a use subject to use on review approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| in the CN neighborhood commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| This amends Ordinance 0-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3887)|
| 1:04:54| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| The proper motion would be to send forward no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| Send forward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| Make a motion to send forward that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| So we have a motion from Commissioner Anders and a second I heard over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| I couldn't tell if that was Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| So we have a proper motion and a second to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| Is anybody here from the staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| I don't see if Gerald is over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Well, I also want to be clear, and I really appreciate the commission following my direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| I was very clear in the forum that as it relates to this legislation around microbreweries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| that we were not to have any samples here at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| You say we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| Yeah, I was talking about the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| It would go well with the pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| And John may know the answer to this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| So this is just in neighborhood commercial, and I'm assuming this is for a certain purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| but wouldn't it make sense to have the conversation about the same microbreweries in shopping centers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| Because, like, if these big boxes go out of business, and we've run into it with churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| at Epitow, One Life Church was right next to a Mexican restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| We went through a big issue because there was a daycare in the shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| and we may have to fix it on something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| But, you know, if a guy owns a shopping center and a daycare moves in, it restricts a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| And so we really need to look at our shopping center ordinance to make sure that we can put in a store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| that sells on-premise beer in a shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| But this may not fit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| I was hoping Gerald was here to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| I guess what we can do when we come up to actually get a vote next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| I'll talk to him next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| So, yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| Yeah, I was hoping he'd be here, too, because I had some questions about it, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| as it pertains to what is currently usable in commercial, neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| and are bars allowed in neighborhood commercial zonings right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| Because, in essence, if it's an on-premise microbrewery, that's what you're opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| Go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| That was the direction I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| And I know the church in South Knoxville that is becoming a brewery that's off of Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| is that still coming to that vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| So that's what I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| It's rezoned already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| I think this motion has been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| It's properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| Item number 36 has already been heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| We're on item 37, discussion item regarding the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| We'll have some discussion, but as I thought rolling into this meeting, it will be a little bit more of just a telling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| as opposed to just a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| If you look at the way our charter is set up in terms of determining how we will do the charter review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4058)|
| 1:07:44| that will start next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| In the attachment that we posted to the forum, it shows that we need to have this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| I think the board was constituted, which basically means formed prior to January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4071)|
| 1:07:57| So that means that we will need to vote on that committee at the December Board of Commissioners meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4077)|
| 1:08:04| There's also a few little moving parts to this that you need to be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| Whoever you nominate to serve on that committee, the election commission will probably have to do a verification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4089)|
| 1:08:16| to just make sure that they're living in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| So what I'm going to respectfully request is if it would be possible to get your names you'd like to submit to Drusilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4100)|
| 1:08:30| probably it would be, frankly, wonderful if you get it one week before the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| That way, I'll give you about three weeks or so, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| so that we can submit those names to the election commission to make sure that they're all clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4117)|
| 1:08:44| And then the first meeting, we'll look at statute and I'll look to the way it's been done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| We'll probably have to start getting that rolling in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| But our main step right now is get the meeting formed before January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4131)|
| 1:08:58| So that's my telling part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| Now I'll get back to the discussion part, which is I'll look to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| I'll let John go here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| Did I have to be a registered voter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| John's question was did I have to be a registered voter, and I looked, so, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| That was the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Yeah, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| So, all right, go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| I believe on this commission, Brad and I are the only ones that sat on the charter review last time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4160)|
| 1:09:27| And if you'll remember, Brad, there was a problem with us getting started and getting voted because we didn't have a full panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4167)|
| 1:09:35| So it's very important to start looking now to find somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| and you need to make sure they're going to make a commitment because it was a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4179)|
| 1:09:46| And find good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| What would you say time-wise, day-wise, just so we can tell some people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| I believe we met weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| I think we met, I was going to say a couple of, I thought it was every other Wednesday or something for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| For a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| And a lot of it just depends upon how much you want to do to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| There was several large issues that were on charter review last time, the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| There was term limits, actually setting and defining those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| And there was actually so much that we had to break it down into two election cycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| We did the primary, we broke it down to just basically wordsmithing and cleaning up language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4222)|
| 1:10:29| and then left the heavy issues for the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| I'm not sure it's going to be anywhere as long as that, but you never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4232)|
| 1:10:40| I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| Does that committee, I don't know if it was perfectly clear in the statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| but is a chairman of that committee elected by the body itself to help organize and schedule the meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| And as you all saw, and I'm also saying this for the public that may be watching tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| the mayor gets to make appointments as well as each commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| And unfortunately, I was about to get over to you guys, each commissioner that represents a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| For example, Commissioner Jay and Commissioner Biggs will not be able to make an appointment to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| Each one of us will get one appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| And then the mayor, I believe, does the mayor get nine appointments as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| He gets one for each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| So you have 27 people on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| Bear in mind, they cannot be an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| Can there be a county employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| Can there be a county employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| Question for the law director if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| Where Larson lives, I guess, in the fourth, Justin lives in the seventh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| Could they serve in those seats if Q does not want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| I don't think elected officials can serve in those seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| I'm talking about as the commissioner for that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| They live in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| I understand, but there is a commissioner for that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| They have their district, which are seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| I was trying to unhook Q there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| No, it's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| It's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| I'm all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| Did I say no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| Yeah, just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| So originally the Charter Review Committee was when there were 19 county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| And then we dropped to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| So the last time you guys did it, the at-larges didn't participate at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4334)|
| 1:12:20| And then the mayor then selects an individual from each one of the county commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4340)|
| 1:12:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| Well, and frankly, and of course I'm going to preface this by saying this could be something for that review committee to even look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4350)|
| 1:12:37| is the actual process of charter review is another thing that could be reviewed during charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| I know that's a little bit of a chicken-and-the-egg thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| but if through that process of reviewing the charter and updating it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| if that committee comes up with some ideas on how it might be more efficient than having a 27-person committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4368)|
| 1:12:56| then that's something that could be considered as well, to your point, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| That was a long time ago, but I do believe that topic did come up during charter review last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| I guess that's perfectly clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| Drusilla, are you good with those names and knowing that as soon as they start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| they could probably hopefully will start coming in this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| and making sure we get them over to the election commission to verify all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| Does that sound like a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| I'm going to strike that one off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| Yes, I'm sorry, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| But could somebody lay out what the process would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| Where do they meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Do they get the initial charter documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| I mean, I'm going to look to Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Andrews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| who served on that committee the last time around, and if you've got to tell you what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| take a couple of minutes now, because part of this, we're all going to be twisting the arms of our constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4429)|
| 1:13:55| to serve on this, and if you guys could sort of share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| I mean, you just mentioned that we met almost weekly, but how long was the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| And I guess the question I have, if this committee comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| what election cycle would something actually appear on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| Because I guess that cycle, you've got a November presidential election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| and then you've probably got a primary, I guess, in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| But if you all could go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| Randy and then Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| Well, we all met in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| Every seat on this dais was full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| And it was Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| I think it was Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| It can be whenever you want it to be, but it was Wednesdays because nobody else used the building at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| And it was months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| It was three or four months, maybe longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| And I would imagine we can't get anything done for the March ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| Timing-wise, it would probably almost be impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| So you're looking at the August and November elections, that you could put those on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| So, I mean, it's going to be a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| It's not, you know, you've got to figure out what people want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| That's the first step, is what do you want to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| Do we have existing documents from the last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| Minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| We have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| Yeah, you've got them, but they're long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| I mean, we're here two or three hours at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| That commitment I need to make sure people understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| And the charter is online, the current charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| It is, yeah, but I just want to make sure that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| So is there, to ask my question, so it's possible that any submissions that the committee makes a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4515)|
| 1:15:23| that could either appear on the August or November election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| So either or, not necessarily has to be August or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| It's not mandated in the charter to say which election it has to appear in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| And you don't have to work that long either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| You can get done in May, but it just goes with the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| And there's timing issues, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| It's got to be done so long before the election to get printed and reviewed by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| So there's timing issues, too, that we have to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| And I'm not sure who chairs the first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| Is it the law department until the chairman's elected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| Or is it the county clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| I would recommend the clerk because we advise the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| But the first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| I don't know that it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| You elect a chairman, and then from there you set your times and the agenda and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4569)|
| 1:16:17| It's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| So are you going to check the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| I'll redo the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| It's your first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| If you could bring that scoop to next Monday's meeting, that would be awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| I guess everybody, is that clear as mud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| We'll move on to the next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| And that is, I think that's item 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| Regarding the resolution for the Big Ears Festival funding through Arts and Cultural Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| I wanted to bring this to the body based on a conversation I had recently with Kim Bumpus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| If you all remember, last year we brought a resolution to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| I think I brought it up initially like a discussion item based on some feedback from Commissioner Daley and some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| We ended up doing a formal performance contract with Big Ears that was managed through a visit in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4621)|
| 1:17:10| Kim has suggested that it might be more appropriate to manage that type of contract through the Arts and Cultural Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| And I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| But before I brought anything formally to this body, I wanted to at least kind of give you all a heads up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| to see if that's something that this body would entertain to do a similar kind of contract around Big Ears that we did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| But instead of having Visit Knoxville do it, have the Arts and Cultural Alliance help manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| So go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| So last year we appropriated, what was it, $60,000, I believe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| No, I think it was $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| You're at $25,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| Yeah, it was $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| Oh, got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Okay, so it was a total of $60,000 they were looking for maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| Okay, so then we did in this current budget, we did appropriate the same amount then, the $25,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| No, this I think would be a separate appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| I think when we went through the budget process, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| they did not realize that Big Ears was actually transitioning from Visit Knoxville over to Arts and Cultural Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4689)|
| 1:18:17| so it will require a separate contract or separate appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| And then is there some deal with them for their 2020?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| Did I read something in the paper about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| You know what, you were thinking of the Blooms one I think got canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Oh, got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| Yeah, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| I couldn't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| Yeah, the Rhythm and Blooms I think I saw with the lawsuit just got canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Yeah, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| That's it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| So I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| So we didn't, at this point, they've gotten nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| Did you ask finance if they have $25,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| I know Chris has been in the loop on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| I would like to find out from the finance director if he could bring us this information next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4742)|
| 1:19:09| Is there any portion of the hotel motel tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| Does the city have a layer of hotel motel tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| They do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| Well, just tell me next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| And how much the city appropriates for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| This is a very important festival for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| From what I understand, this is one of the highest booked motel weekends and weeks for downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4768)|
| 1:19:36| So I look forward to talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| Go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| Does this change the allocation total for the Arts and Cultural Alliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| It would probably increase the total appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| So, because it wasn't a part of this, so that's what I'm. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| Yeah, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| I guess as we move to look at the total amount for big years, would that be factored into this resolution or is this. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4794)|
| 1:20:01| Probably next year's cycle, but for right now, I think it was one of those things that when they applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| I don't think we realized that it was. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| I think their intent was to keep things simple, to just join the Arts and Cultural Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| because it sort of lined up a little closer with their mission, but I know it was coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| I didn't even realize it myself that those were going to be separate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| and it probably made sense just to sort of make sure that we set up a separate contract for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| There's a similar one, but I'll bring some more information to you all that was similar to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| and I'll get more information for you all that Knox Heritage had done some work for Visit Knoxville as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| with downtown maps and those sort of things, but I'll have some more information for you guys for next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| or as we roll into December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| Go ahead, Commissioner Skinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| Your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| I think that's it for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| All right, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| Item 39, discussion item regarding Western Avenue and Oak Ridge Highway Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4856)|
| 1:21:03| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| My light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| I just had a question that came to mind about the previous resolution we were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4868)|
| 1:21:16| or item, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| So if you're a candidate for office, would you be able to be on the Charter Review Committee as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| I guess meeting the way the – all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| Here I'm going to give you a slow but intentional explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| I guess it depends on how long that committee meets because we've just discussed that it's potential that the vote on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4895)|
| 1:21:44| be in next November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| And if that is the case, you know, then you could see this cycle hopefully not last that long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| but it could – hypothetically speaking, it could go through August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| And then if you are a candidate running for office and maybe you win an election in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4915)|
| 1:22:01| that would be –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| You're not official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| You can't go – well, number one, you're not official until you're sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| Number two, it can't go that far because of the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Because of the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| Technically speaking, you probably could because by the time you are elected or not elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4931)|
| 1:22:17| the committee should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| At least I'll look to the law department to verify that, but that's kind of my take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| The reason I was asking is because if you don't have any opposition in the general and you're – I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| you win your primary, you're basically going to be that elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| The Lord lets you live long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| So you could sway your decision on Charter Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| Bud, have you got a take on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4959)|
| 1:22:40| But you're not technically elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| You have to be a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| You're not sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| You'd have to just be a – ultimately, the fact that you're running for office shouldn't have anything to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| That's all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| Just popped up in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| Just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| On that note, we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| I have spoken with Director Green, and he's going to set up a meeting with Councilwoman Singh to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4982)|
| 1:23:10| and try to get the city to go in on this because there are two sections of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| There is the 640 to basically Shod Road, which is in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| and then from Shod Road on out into Brad's District and Carnes to Solway that I really want to get looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| We have studied a lot of roads in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| A lot of corridor studies, a lot of mobility studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| and we've never really taken a look at Western Avenue from 640 out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5014)|
| 1:23:41| I may be wrong about this, and correct me if I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| but once the section from downtown is done into 640,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| it is the only corridor, I think, that you can walk from this building to the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| which is pretty amazing that the mobility is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| And you also look at the fact that this body and the county has committed to the Shod Road extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| That's another huge road project coming through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| Throw on top of that the fact that there's actually vacant land there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| It is something that if we actually put a study together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| we might be able to motivate people to develop that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5055)|
| 1:24:20| But I would really appreciate it if you all would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| I've supported, I think, 99% of all the studies we've ever done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| If you would support Brad and my desire to have this looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5067)|
| 1:24:34| and I will do my best to meet with my SEMA, city council person, to get the city to participate too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5074)|
| 1:24:43| because I think we need to look at that whole section all the way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| But thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| I've made the executive decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| The discussion regarding information from TCCA, we're going to definitely move that to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| So that leaves us, and I hope everybody is in a foul mood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5099)|
| 1:25:08| I'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| This is our last item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| But Commissioner Smith, we'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| It's 6.30 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| We're looking good on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| But I know Commissioner Smith wanted to bring up the discussion of backyard poultry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| Everybody is joking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| But it's ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| It doesn't look like a goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| Well, let's go straight from the commission to the friar here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| We'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| I have not completely digested the Tennessee law on resources pertaining to the definition of agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| I kind of wanted tonight just to get ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| I have spoken with the law department a couple times on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| And I want everybody to be sure and understand, I'm not here to be the chicken Nazi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| But from what I'm understanding, Bud, tell me what have we got so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5157)|
| 1:26:04| I'm going to have Daniel bring this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| I've had Daniel research this in depth for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| And he is a bigger expert on it than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| So I'm going to have Daniel give you a little short presentation on how the chickens apply to the agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5172)|
| 1:26:18| Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5178)|
| 1:26:24| Thank you, members of the commission, Law Director Daniel Sanders, 400 Main Street, Suite 612, Deputy Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5184)|
| 1:26:32| I have had several conversations with Commissioner Smith about regulation of backyard poultry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5192)|
| 1:26:39| I thought it best to just give you the bottom line up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| The county has no real authority to regulate the keeping of chickens or other kinds of poultry within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5202)|
| 1:26:51| And I'll sort of go into the why about that and let you formulate your questions in the stand for questions after I sort of explained it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5211)|
| 1:27:03| So the county's authority to regulate activity within the jurisdiction is known as the police power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5223)|
| 1:27:10| And the police power involves the regulation of health and safety and morals and general welfare of the people that live in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5230)|
| 1:27:20| When Tennessee courts determine the scope of county and local police power, they look to Dillon's Rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5240)|
| 1:27:29| And Dillon's Rule is a rule of statutory construction that dictates a strict and narrow construction of your authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5249)|
| 1:27:37| as a county commissioner or a county to regulate activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| Dillon's Rule jurisdictions can be contrasted with home rule jurisdictions where local authority is construed broadly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5261)|
| 1:27:52| So the county is a charter form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| Charter forms of government enjoy the ability to pass ordinances that regulate purely county affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5275)|
| 1:28:03| However, those ordinances can't be in conflict with the general law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| The general law dealing with county authorities contained in Title V, Chapter 1, Part 1 of the Tennessee Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5289)|
| 1:28:16| those statutes enable counties to make contracts, to pass health and building codes, to borrow money, sell property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5296)|
| 1:28:24| and deal with various other things that you deal with month in and month out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5304)|
| 1:28:31| However broad those powers may be, they place special limitations on your ability to regulate agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5311)|
| 1:28:38| Tennessee Code Annotated 5-1, Section 118 provides that counties have no power to prohibit or regulate normal agricultural activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5318)|
| 1:28:50| Additionally, under Tennessee Code Annotated 5-1, Section 122, counties have no power to regulate buildings used primarily for agricultural purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5330)|
| 1:29:03| The General Assembly went on, being the intent of the General Assembly that the powers granted to counties by this part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5343)|
| 1:29:09| should not be used to inhibit normal agricultural activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| Now those are the general powers that a county has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| A separate area of authority that counties use to regulate land use, and you're well familiar with this, is the area of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5358)|
| 1:29:28| So the County Zoning Authority is set out in Title 13, Chapter 7, Part 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5368)|
| 1:29:36| and it's subject to similar limitations on agricultural regulations as we found in Title V.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5376)|
| 1:29:44| Tennessee Code Annotated 13-7-114 provides in part that this part shall not be construed as authorizing the requirement of building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5384)|
| 1:29:53| nor providing for any regulation of the erection, construction, or reconstruction of any building or other structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5393)|
| 1:30:00| on lands now devoted to agricultural uses or which here and after may be used for agricultural purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5400)|
| 1:30:07| Nor shall this chapter be construed as limiting or affecting in any way controlling the agricultural uses of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5407)|
| 1:30:15| And now that is extremely broad, where you find an agricultural use on land, you can't use your zoning authority to regulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5415)|
| 1:30:23| Now, I've talked about what your authority is in general terms, and it generally doesn't involve regulation of agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5423)|
| 1:30:33| Agriculture is defined in the Tennessee Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| It's defined identically in Tennessee Code Annotated Title 1, Chapter 3, Section 105, and Title 43, Chapter 1, Section 113.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5437)|
| 1:30:59| And under both of those sections, agriculture means the lands, buildings, and machinery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| used in the commercial production of farm products and nursery stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| the activity carried on in connection with the commercial production of farm products and nursery stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5468)|
| 1:31:14| and the recreational and educational activities used on land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5474)|
| 1:31:19| on land used for the commercial production of nursery products and nursery stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5479)|
| 1:31:24| and then even entertainment activities conducted in conjunction with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| but secondary to the commercial production of farm products and nursery stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| Farm products and nursery stock is further defined as the forage and sod crops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5494)|
| 1:31:42| grains and feed crops, dairy and dairy products, poultry and poultry products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5502)|
| 1:31:50| livestock, including breeding and grazing, fruits, vegetables, flowers, and on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| Things that you would normally consider agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| So, to wrap it up, chickens and other kinds of poultry are specifically included in the definition of agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5518)|
| 1:32:08| and therefore they are beyond the general authority that the county has to regulate activity through the police power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5528)|
| 1:32:16| and specifically beyond the authority of the county to regulate through the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| So, for these reasons, we don't have any authority to regulate the keeping of chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5541)|
| 1:32:28| or other kinds of poultry within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| Okay. Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| Well, even on, I understand ag land, I get that, but in a subdivision that's, you know, LDR, MDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5554)|
| 1:32:42| you're saying that the county can't do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| Well, the statute is pretty clear, and it's contained right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| Okay. So, how does the city do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| Well, the city has a totally separate area of authority for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| Their zoning authority comes from Title 13, Chapter 7, Part 2, and ours is Part 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5577)|
| 1:33:09| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| All right. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| How does this coincide with neighborhoods that would have covenants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5594)|
| 1:33:20| So, the covenants, we've talked about that in zoning session before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| Covenants are private agreements that are enforceable between private parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| The county really has no dog in that fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| So, how does someone enforce a covenant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| They would take their neighbor to court and file an action to enforce the covenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5617)|
| 1:33:42| If all the elements of the covenant are present, then the court will enjoin the person who violates the covenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5622)|
| 1:33:53| Okay. Commissioner Smith, I'll go back to you, and then I may even have a question for you, Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| Okay. I would say at some point there is some health issues and noise regulations that would take place in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5638)|
| 1:34:06| From what the law director's office is telling me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| unless you have restricted covenants in place that are still enforced or deed restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5649)|
| 1:34:16| and deed restrictions a lot of times have run for a set amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| and if your association is not still together to renew those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| they lapse that anybody can have as many chickens in their backyard in a subdivision as they wish and roosters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5663)|
| 1:34:35| That's not at all what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| You said we couldn't regulate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| Well, the county commission can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| There is the law of nuisance that exists at common law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| and if you have too many chickens in your backyard or too many of any other kind of farm product or nursery stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5690)|
| 1:34:58| it may create a nuisance condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| That's another private area of law that one neighbor can enforce against the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| This is the context where the Right to Farm Act often comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| The Right to Farm Act provides that where these agricultural activities occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| they're presumed not to be a nuisance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| and the law creates a rebuttable presumption that whatever you're doing on your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| if it's a normal agricultural activity, that that's not going to be a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| Is there a threshold for what constitutes agricultural activities such as $1,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5730)|
| 1:35:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| I guess my only question, I was trying to get ready for the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| I was looking at the last time we discussed the Tennessee Right to Farm Act was about three or four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5743)|
| 1:35:50| We were talking about venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| It was a really interesting discussion from a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| The only word that looked over my past notes, and I had one word that stuck out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| and that word was commercial, which was in the Tennessee Right to Farm Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| And the only area when it looks at, say, this chicken conversation that is before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5767)|
| 1:36:13| is the potential to what Commissioner Smith's point is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| if you had a hobbyist chicken person who had chickens in the backyard as a hobby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| who was not selling eggs, who was really not engaged in any commercial enterprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| would that apply just because the word in the Tennessee Right to Farm Act in multiple areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| seems to be the commercial production of farm and agriculture-related products?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| There is not a threshold to commercial activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5796)|
| 1:36:42| And, you know, I would –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| Is there anywhere in TCA where you can see a definition between hobbyist and commercial production| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5804)|
| 1:36:51| if someone's not engaged in the buying and selling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| No, the word commercial is not defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| It would be – a court would construe that term broadly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| just like the term agriculture is construed broadly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| That term has been through the ringer in the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| Well, that's why you've got a very clear definition of agriculture in the Tennessee Right to Farm Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| I mean, it's gone through it, and that's why we have a very clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| correct me if I'm wrong, definition of agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| So let's say that the county tried to regulate backyard chickens or poultry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5837)|
| 1:37:23| a sign that said eggs for sale probably would be construed as commercial activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5843)|
| 1:37:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| And even in other contexts, courts have construed activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5852)|
| 1:37:39| that doesn't even propose an exchange as affecting commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5859)|
| 1:37:45| I could very easily see a situation where a person raises eggs for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5865)|
| 1:37:53| or chickens for themselves, and that might be considered commerce because it affects commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| That person then doesn't have to go out and purchase eggs on the market or chickens on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5878)|
| 1:38:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| Any other questions on this discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| Is there anything in the statutes that state that the primary use of the property has to be agriculture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5891)|
| 1:38:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| Well, I'll take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| With respect to the entertainment venues, that has to be secondary to the agricultural enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5907)|
| 1:38:35| But if you're attempting to regulate the agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| which is the commercial production of farm products or nursery stock, that is in itself agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5919)|
| 1:38:47| It doesn't have to be the primary activity on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5927)|
| 1:38:54| A house in a subdivision where the primary activity is residential home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| would be trumped by selling a couple eggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| Under the Tennessee Code, it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| Chairman Austin, I would ask you to reach out to your connections in the agricultural industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5953)|
| 1:39:21| and I'd like to read over this Tennessee law on resources pertaining to the definition of agriculture a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5961)|
| 1:39:29| Like I said, I'm not wanting to be the chicken Nazi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| I just think that there is anything that's not regulated and wide open has the ability to turn into a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5972)|
| 1:39:42| And reasonable, you know, what the city has passed seems to be fairly reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5982)|
| 1:39:48| to allow people to raise their own eggs without bringing up the possibility of somebody having 50 chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5988)|
| 1:39:54| and roosters in their backyard in a small neighborhood on a third acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=5994)|
| 1:40:01| I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| So, yeah, I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| So that we can come back next week with further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| Where we're hung in this is the definitions for the jurisdiction the city has versus the jurisdiction the county has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6013)|
| 1:40:20| If we want to have the same jurisdiction the city has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| that's a state representative issue that they can change the state code to where we can do what the city does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| but right now we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| And in that conversation, something that I did not realize that Commissioner Anders brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6032)|
| 1:40:39| their zoning and our zoning come from two different things, yet we have one combined zoning entity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6039)|
| 1:40:49| And that particular board comes from a third one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| where you have a regional planning commission versus a local planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| Thank you, Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Seeing no additional chicken discussion, all joking aside, it is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6063)|
| 1:41:10| And everybody knows I'm passionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| My wife puts the culture in agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| So it's an important topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| So anyhow, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| And, Madam Clerk, I'm not seeing any additional items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| We're going to move the last discussion item forward to next week's BOC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| And do we have a motion for dismissal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| Any announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| Before you adjourn the meeting, I just want to commend our soon-to-be Eagle Scout for sitting through the entire meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6096)|
| 1:41:43| And well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| And your friendly neighborhood at-large commissioners over here would like to offer anybody a piece of pizza on the way out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| That sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| Maybe we can free you a piece of pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191112?start=6113)|
