| 0:11:10| And which item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| Number 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| Okay, that one will be heard at its normally scheduled time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=673)|
| 0:11:21| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Hi, Rob A. Monday, 902 Kermit Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=682)|
| 0:11:30| For item 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Item 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| Yes, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Lisa Kerr, 8657 Ball Camp Pike, number 18, Santa Investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=701)|
| 0:11:50| Just 18 or did you have another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Did you just say 18 or did you have another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Okay, 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| All right, that will be also heard at its regularly scheduled time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| Motion to hear consent with the exception of items 29, 12, and 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, a second by Commissioner Clancy to hear consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| Motion to approve consent with the exception of 29, 12, and 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, a second by Commissioner Clancy to approve consent list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=753)|
| 0:12:40| We're going to start today's meeting with agenda number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=760)|
| 0:12:48| This is closure of public right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| The applicant is Aaron M. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| The right of way to be closed is an unnamed alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| The location is between South 21st Street and 22nd Street, south of Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=778)|
| 0:13:06| The applicant's reason for closure is the intended development plans to utilize the entire block as part of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=786)|
| 0:13:17| The applicant states that the concept would create a scenario where the alley would no longer be necessary for access to any of the parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=797)|
| 0:13:25| The development would also create one lot out of the existing parcels and the abandoned alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| Staff recommendation is to deny the closure of the unnamed alley south of Cumberland Avenue between South 21st and 22nd Streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=811)|
| 0:13:40| as it is an active alley that provides connectivity in an area of high congestion with several one-way streets and restricted turning options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=820)|
| 0:13:48| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| Sir, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| My name is Aaron Gray with Folger McIndoe and Associates representing 10330 Hardin Valley Road, Suite 201, representing the ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=836)|
| 0:14:04| They have requested that we could postpone for 30 days on this to the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=844)|
| 0:14:13| Motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy and a second by Commissioner Smith to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Is there any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| We'll see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| Next is agenda item number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| This is rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| The applicant is James S. Monday, Robert A. Monday Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| The location is the north side of Valgro Road, east of Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| Approximate size of the tract is 2.82 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| Present zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| Zoning requested is LI, light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| Existing land use is light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| And the proposed use is light industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| Staff recommendation is to approve EC Employment Center zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| since LI and I zones were replaced by the EC zone in the rural area of the growth policy plan after it was updated in 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=909)|
| 0:15:20| allowing for additional public review and standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| The applicant requested LI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| Sir, would you like to address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| And did you write down your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| I'll be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| The clock won't start until you're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=942)|
| 0:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| Yes, and go ahead and state your name and address one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| Robert Aaron Monday, 902 Kermit Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Okay, well, thank you very much for the time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| The reason we're asking for a rezoning here is because we've had an industrial building that has been in existence for a very, very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=972)|
| 0:16:24| And I became the manager of this property a little over, I guess, a year ago now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| and we have been working very hard to make improvements in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| And we've made a lot of progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| I could spend a lot of time talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| But particularly what needs to happen right now is we have a parcel that is obviously in industrial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1000)|
| 0:16:47| and has been that way for decades, but it's zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| This has created a huge problem for us because any tenant that we want to put in there, if we can't grow something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| then that tenant is technically not allowed to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| And so that's been a real hardship, and that's what has prompted us to approach this forum to get it changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1022)|
| 0:17:13| And the staff recommendation for this is Employment Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| We reached out to the brokerage community to talk about Employment Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| and here's the feedback that we got from our broker that we use in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| They said quite clearly that, frankly, the brokerage community doesn't know very much about Employment Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| and neither do many of the potential tenants because there's only one building in Knox County that has Employment Center zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1053)|
| 0:17:42| All the rest are vacant parcels that have yet to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| There are three areas in Knox County that have Employment Center zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| Those are the Midway Business Park, not built, the Carnes Valley Business Park, not built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1069)|
| 0:17:57| and then two parcels that are in this general vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| Of those two parcels, one is not built, one is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| Recently we had the experience of our neighbor, Jackie Stanley, Stanley Fencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| coming and trying to build on the unbuilt parcel with Employment Center zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| He purchased the parcel about a year ago, and he sold the parcel last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| The reason he sold the parcel is he found it very, very difficult to do what he needed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| So he has now exited that investment, and nothing is going to happen on that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| We're concerned about the restrictions that Employment Center zoning is going to impose on our existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1109)|
| 0:18:37| Unfortunately, I didn't pick our starting point on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| That was done decades ago, quite frankly, before I was even born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| So we're requesting the light industrial zoning for a very practical reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| That's what the sector plan says it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| That's what the current use is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| We feel that it is pretty obvious that this is a light industrial use and that it should be a light industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1135)|
| 0:19:07| Just a little bit further south, there's the light industrial zoning that has been that way for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1147)|
| 0:19:18| This parcel is a stone's throw from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| So for all the reasons that I just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| we feel that it is very important to have light industrial zoning instead of Employment Center zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| We think that Employment Center zoning is wonderfully designed for new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| but unfortunately for an existing building to have that as the starting point is going to create challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| and operational headaches for us in the future that, frankly, we've already been dealing with, just in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| So that's the reason why we're coming and approaching the body here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1188)|
| 0:19:56| and asking for them to consider light industrial instead of Employment Center zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Ms. Albertson, this is your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Give us a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| So as was read in the staff report recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| the reason we considered the Employment Center zone over the light industrial zone is that the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| does not permit consideration of the light industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| This area falls within the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| It is near the Sevier County line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| It's not too far from Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| The property is serviced by Valgro Road, which is a local road up to a certain point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1234)|
| 0:20:41| but then it turns into a private joint permanent easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| The infrastructure out to this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| although industrial activities have occurred out here for quite a long time, the infrastructure is lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1248)|
| 0:20:56| We know that the Camel Tent facility was out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| and the light industrial zoning that you do see depicted on the map in the general area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| happened before the adoption of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| So it's put staff in a difficult position to be able to make any sort of recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| for anything in the rural area other than the Employment Center zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| If you look at the list of uses that are allowed in the Employment Center zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| there's quite a number of uses that would also be allowed in the light industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1283)|
| 0:21:31| everything from construction and contracting to manufacturing, wholesale trade, transportation and warehousing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| finance and insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| The NAICS codes are all in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| In fact, I would say that the EC zone has the most comprehensive list of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| explicitly stated of all the industrial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| The area regulations would be a bit of a challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1310)|
| 0:21:57| but as Mr. Munday said, this building is already constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| So the standards for some of the EC zone would only kick into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| if there were to be major alterations or changes to the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| So given the limited infrastructure that's in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| the fact that we would not be able to see a plan associated with any sort of alteration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1336)|
| 0:22:25| or expansion of the existing light industrial use out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| staff feels that the EC zone is the more appropriate zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| because it would give us the opportunity to see a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| So just to clarify, because of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| the light industrial is not even an available zoning option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| It explicitly states that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| Under Section, let's see, 3.2 of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1375)|
| 0:23:05| it said that by the February 1st of 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| MPC shall deliver a recommended text of a new planned business and industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| And upon enactment of that zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| these new zones shall be replaced, including planned commercial, light industrial, and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| And this is within the rural area of the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| I was just wanting to ask the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| are there specific areas of this zone that, is it a setback issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| Is there impervious area restrictions outside storage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| I mean, I'm sympathetic to what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| I'm just curious if there are specific aspects of EC that are problematic that you know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1425)|
| 0:23:53| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| So you mentioned one of the major issues, which is setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| Just visually looking at what's on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| you can see that we are sitting right on the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| and that's how it has been for, I'm going to say, actually four or five decades now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| On the setbacks in EC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| The existing building would be considered grandfathered use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| and they would not have to comply with those setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| And as Ms. Albertson said, the only time the setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| those standards would come into play would be if there were a major alteration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| And typically the standard is that you can continue the noncompliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| in a straight line in the plains that could extend the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| as long as it did not increase the setback violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| So there are pretty generous opportunities for expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| for use of the existing building and for expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| even though it is nonconforming under the setback standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| I've dealt with this kind of stuff before where you have a newer zone that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| this zone is suitable for use in areas meeting locational standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1502)|
| 0:25:09| for industrial parks and technology-based development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| I wish there was a way we could help this situation with Light Industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| If we're just not allowed to, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| But I do sympathize with his situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| and I'm not convinced that EC is the right zoning for there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| I think it's a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| There are some limitations of the EC zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| but the important thing to remember is, as Ms. Albertson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| the limited infrastructure in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| The EC zone, the major benefit of this from the staff standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| is that it does require plan review by this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| to ensure that there's not a use in there that would go in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| that would generate traffic that can't be accommodated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| by the limited road infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| a use that would have an adverse impact on the surrounding agricultural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| This is in a rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| so we feel that it's within the parameters of what we can recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| It provides opportunities for the use of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| but provides some protection for the community as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| and the future users, because if a use goes in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| and they start having challenges with trucking or other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| it doesn't benefit anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| No, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| I think Gerald responded to my initial concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| I know you said that EC has the most comprehensive list of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| What do you lose by the difference between EC and LI?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| What can't you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| I would say that's a pretty tough question to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| I think the LI zone was written so long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| probably even before the NICS standards for business classifications existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| So I could just read off a few of things that are allowed in the LI industrial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| to let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| It goes through warehousing, manufacturing, retail sales, processing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| wholesale, yard sales, wireless communication facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| There are a lot of things, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| that aren't explicitly listed in here that are explicitly listed in the employment center zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| So I would say there's less ambiguity with the EC zone than there is with the LI zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| But all those things you just read off, those are available to be done in an EC zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| That's what the EC zone was designed for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| basically just to be a plan zone that allows industrial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| in areas where infrastructure may be limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| so we get the opportunity to review a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| So basically what we're dealing with is a perception of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| from a marketing standpoint, which we're really not allowed to opine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1689)|
| 0:28:16| That's a tough one because logically it looks like, just from the map and from common sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| it looks like LI would be a logical zone for that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1702)|
| 0:28:29| It's being used that way now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| It's contiguous with other LI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| The only thing we lose is the review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| I'm tempted to go ahead and motion for LI, but the review process is what sticks me there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1723)|
| 0:28:54| I just think that even though the stigma of EC has not been embraced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1734)|
| 0:29:03| in the commercial real estate world yet, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| I think the review process is enough to get me past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| So I'd like to make a motion that we approve EC employment zone for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1752)|
| 0:29:20| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| We do have several other lights on that we'll hear from more commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Liz, on an existing building, will the Planning Commission have the opportunity to review the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1769)|
| 0:29:36| or just the actual, if it's a new project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| It would just be if it's a new project, if there's some sort of major renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| like Gerald mentioned earlier that has to go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| So if Mr. Munday leased the building to a manufacturing operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| we would not necessarily review that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| That's correct if it's under EC, if they can accommodate that use in that structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1798)|
| 0:30:05| I guess I'm not seeing a real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| I can understand when it's agriculture that's an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| and your EC designation, I don't see the real hardship here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| Is it okay that I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| In our experience, if there is any ambiguity, typically that's going to trigger a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1822)|
| 0:30:29| So if there's any room for interpretation, it seems that we probably will be going through the review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1829)|
| 0:30:37| which we would welcome, but it brings another challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| In this one property over, we have an example of someone who just abandoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| trying to get something done in the EC zone, and so that challenge is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| Let's remember, we're talking about the second building in Knox County to get this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| It is still very much experimental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| No one in the commercial real estate community who's not doing development, that's different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| but everyone who's doing brokerage of existing buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| that's not aware of this zoning because it hasn't come up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| And so we're very much an experimental territory with an area that's been industrial for 100 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| with a building that's been in existence for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| One of the reasons the EC has not been used a great deal is because it is in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| It's not a location where there are a lot of industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| The few opportunities that have been taken of that have been primarily by the development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| for the Carnes Business Park in Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| It's not that zone that is applied in areas where large businesses are typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1895)|
| 0:31:43| or industries are looking to locate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Driving down Valgro Road, I can think of a number of reasons why this property is difficult to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| It's not near major transportation corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| It's in the middle of a very rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| There are a number of challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| I would not place all the challenge on the EC zoning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| The challenges are certainly real,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| and I can't imagine how difficult it must be to develop this property in its location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| but I would not blame it entirely on the EC zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| Commissioner Smith, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| Yeah, is there landscaping requirements, a landscape plan in this submittal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| Not in the submittal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| There are some in the EC, as I remember, and it's been a while since I've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| The Planning Commission can, as part of the plan review, require landscape requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| Mr. Mundy, I'm looking for a hardship to sympathize with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| Other than marketing, which I believe you could market it as light industrial uses permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1970)|
| 0:32:57| and other than an additional review, convince me there's another hardship there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1977)|
| 0:33:05| because it sure seems like you're able to do what you want to do under EC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1985)|
| 0:33:13| So this is not a new building, not by any stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| It's been there for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| And so at some point, just taking a hypothetical situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| we're going to have a tenant who says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| we like this 55,000-square-foot building, but we need this one thing changed about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| And then we're going to come back here, and we're going to try to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| And when we have the Employment Center zoning, it's not going to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| and we're going to lose that tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| So unless they're content with the building that's there, which is a great building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| but it only works for a certain segment of potential users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| And so if we don't thread the needle with that potential user| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| who is not going to try to modify the building in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| then I think we're going to run into challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| But it's my understanding you can modify the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| you just can't worsen the condition, basically the non-conforming structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2043)|
| 0:34:10| If they did an addition to the building, that addition would come through for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| But internal modifications, maintenance, which the building appears to need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2054)|
| 0:34:21| other activities to the existing building that did not extend the footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| would not come before this for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| Mr. Hilde, to use a very real example, we need more bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| And we've got a concrete slab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| We have a very small bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| We have one bathroom, which means that the building cannot be shared among two tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| You can't find a 25,000-square-foot tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| and a 30,000-square-foot tenant to fill the space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| because they have to share a bathroom, and that's created issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| So we need to add a bathroom, and we don't want to break the slab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| Where are we going to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| We're going to try to put it on the outside of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| So that's a very real example of something that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| We want to spend the money, we want to upgrade the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| but ECU zoning is going to get in our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| I must be the only one confused because I thought you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| You just couldn't worsen the nonconforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| And that's one of the challenges of having zoning interpretations by another department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| If I'm requested to make an interpretation of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| it would be such a minor addition that it would not require review by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2128)|
| 0:35:36| In addition to an existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| Is Peter Ahrens here to weigh in on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| He's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| It would be Max Lemons and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| And I have to admit the county is getting very good at calling me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| for input on interpretations every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| Mr. Hill, you're not the only one that's confused because I'm sitting over here confused as I can be as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| I'm still not sure I'm clear on what, I mean, we read off what was allowed in light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| What I'm trying to figure out is what's not allowed in EC that is allowed in light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| What are we restricting this existing property to that it wouldn't be under light industrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2183)|
| 0:36:31| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| I'm trying to get a feel for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| I think light industrial allows consideration of yard sales and rummage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| There's another very real example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| It's storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| Outside storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| Inside storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| Liz, keep me honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| I believe inside storage is not allowed in EC zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| Outdoor storage is allowed in EC zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| It is subject to some requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| As it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| And let's see, in light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| But indoor storage like the ones that U-Haul is building all around East Tennessee right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| Self-storage facilities are allowed in the light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| Are they allowed in EC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| And under EC, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| Wouldn't that be considered warehousing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| I mean, inside storage is warehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| That's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| You're saying that's not allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| No, that is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| Warehousing and storage is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| It would be an interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| We'd be coming to interpret that, wouldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| Not if it's permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| But it's not explicitly permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| I mean, that's, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| Is it allowed in EC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| Or is it a use unreviewed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| Under the permitted uses, there's a point in here that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| other uses of the same general character as those listed in the section under permitted uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| and deemed appropriate by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| It's basically the major difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| EC is very wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| With that provision, the planning commission has the ability to allow pretty much any use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| The key here, and I think Mr. Mundy has addressed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| is that in EC there is a plan review requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| Sometimes for uses, if there's a use that's not specifically identified in the EC zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| this commission has the opportunity to review that use to see if it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| I'm trying to understand what the difference in permitted uses in EC and permitted uses in LI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| EC is broader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| It's broader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| It permits a broader range of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| And there is, just for a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| under one of the subsections for transportation and warehousing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| it does explicitly say warehousing and storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| Is allowed or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| Is allowed in the EC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| Mr. Mundy, you've owned the property for how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| So I need to parse this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| James S. Mundy is the owner of the property, and I'm the manager, so it's not me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| But he has owned the property since the early 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| And it's been zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| So I think we're improving the situation going with EC versus agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| I think if there's an issue with leasing the property and getting in a prospective tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| the EC designation is going to be much easier than the agriculture designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| And from what I'm hearing from staff is that there's very little difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| between EC uses allowed versus industrial, late industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| I'm with everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| We'd like to see this work out, but I don't still see the big issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| So I'll agree with you that moving off of agricultural is greatly needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| and is an improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| But now is the time to make the right decision for the property, to set it up for success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| And it needs help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| And we're trying very hard on our side to help it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| We're doing what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| But what we're working with right now is a difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| And so that's kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| I agree with you that the agricultural zoning needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| This is something that has needed to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| But now is our time to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| And I think it's really important that we address it the right way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| because what we do might not be able to change in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| And so this is what we're going to be living with for a very, very long time in all likelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2476)|
| 0:41:24| Commissioner Roth, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| I think I just want to reiterate what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| And I'm not saying I disagree with going with EC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| But what I'm hearing, what I think I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| is that both of these zones, LI and EC, are relatively similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| I still don't think I have a grasp on what's different other than that EC requires a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2505)|
| 0:41:54| And the review only kicks in when there's something that's not a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| There are two times the review could kick in with the existing building if there's a use proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| and it's not explicitly enumerated in the zoning classification, the list of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| And this commission has the ability to approve that use upon request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| finding that it fits in the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| The other time that the commission would review would be if there's an addition to the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| a significant addition to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| What is significant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| That would be my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| That's something that would generate more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| It's not based totally on the size but the impact of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| Something like a bathroom, I would argue with county codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| that that is not something that would require a review by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| So you said if the building was going to be used for something that was not permitted in the EC zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2567)|
| 0:42:53| what's it used for now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| Vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Currently it's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Currently it's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| What was it last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| Yeah, what was it last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| It was a welding and machine shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| Is that allowed in the EC zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| Would there have to be a review for that use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| Not for that use, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| But to be clear, that welding shop took a small portion of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| That was not the right tenant for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| They took a small portion of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| They paid rent that was probably one-fifth of what would be considered a market rent for that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| Those are our proceeds to reinvest in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| and the infrastructure that everyone is talking about needs to be upgraded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| Mr. Mundy, I hear what you're saying, and I'm certainly sympathetic to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| and I want you to be able to use your property for what it needs to be used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| and what it should be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| But I'm just not hearing anything here under EC that you wouldn't be allowed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2625)|
| 0:43:53| I mean, unless you want to land airplanes on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| you'd have to come to commission and get approval for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| But I don't hear anything different here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| than between the two that would be prohibitive for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| So we need to lease our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| We need parking places for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| We don't have enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| There's another issue that's just staring us in the face the very next time we have to lease this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| So explain to the commission what under EC would prevent you from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| Well, and please keep me honest because I'm not an expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| But what I can say about it is that we don't have enough existing parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| so we would like more parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| That's going to be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| It's also going to need landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| Well, we don't have enough room for landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| because this property, when it was built, EC didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| Nobody made room for that, and we can't create the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| And even though the parcel looks like it extends on what is the east side of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| the right side of the picture we're all looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| there is a huge difference in topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| It goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| And so the vast majority of that is not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| The small area of flat land that we do have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| it needs to all be parking in order for any sort of employees to be able to work in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| if it's actually being used most productively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| And so we're going to be back for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| and we're going to be talking about landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| and can we put landscaping down the hill in the woods, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| Director Green, I would like to hear some clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| Are we talking about would it be a major renovation that would trigger that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| or is it I guess the use could trigger it, and then being nonconforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| we're basically boiling it down to setbacks, landscape buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| It seems to be the material differences in these two zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| The meeting setbacks would come into play under either LI or EC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| So that is off the table, in my opinion, because that's an issue to address in each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| Landscaping maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| The gully may serve as the buffer between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| I don't see the topo there, but if there's a gully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| that could serve as the buffer between any use in the adjacent agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2787)|
| 0:46:34| Again, a plan review will come in if there's a use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| that's not specifically identified in the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| and the owner requests that the commission consider that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| The other would be a significant addition to the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| not renovation of the existing building, but significant addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| I just want to make a quick point of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| that there is also a landscaping requirement in the light industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| So along all property lines adjacent to residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| which would include agricultural areas, ornamental vegetation shall be provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| which will reach a minimum height of 15 feet at maturity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| and provide cover within one foot of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| So there is a landscaping standard in LI as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| Yeah, I think that narrows it even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| The difference is LI, there are two significant items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| One is that LI is not permitted in the rural area under the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| The other is that a plan is required at some times in the EC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| And staff, again, feels this is an appropriate place for a plan to be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| because of the challenges with infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| and the fact that this property is bordered on several sides by agricultural land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| and there needs to be some consideration of the impact of any uses on that agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| Mr. Green, would parking require a review by the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| I would work with the codes review and push to have that in administrative review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| Would parking require additional landscaping buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| It depends on the amount of parking required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| but looking at that it looks like if they keep the existing landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| as shown on the agricultural, that would likely meet the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| And Liz has the correct information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Also, there is a landscaping requirement in off-street parking under the light industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| So parking areas shall contain 500 square feet of landscaping for every 20,000 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2911)|
| 0:48:38| or a fraction thereof of paved parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| For each 5,000 square feet of parking area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| trees are required that have to reach 40-foot height at maturity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| So just as a point of information, there's also landscaping required in off-street parking under LI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| Yeah, I'm wondering if light industrial is not allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| why are we talking about light industrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| Because that's what the applicant requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| Well, I understand that, but if it's a fact that we can't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2953)|
| 0:49:19| then it seems to me that the applicant has a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| He can accept this, or he can say, no, I'd rather you just deny it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| and walk away from it and think of something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| But if we can't do light industrial, it seems to me we're just talking in circles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2974)|
| 0:49:43| I agree, and if there is not any other pressing questions or comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| I'd like to go ahead and vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| We do have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| Yeah, could you read the motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| We do have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, second by Commissioner Buston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| to approve the EC Employment Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| Excuse me, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| Since he didn't ask for this zone and we just recommended it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| do you want us to vote on this, or do you want to request a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| That's negotiating with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Well, I know, but I'm saying, would you like to know if he would rather have a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| I mean, he asked for something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| and we're recommending something other than what he requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| Would you like to make any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| Yeah, so, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| Regarding the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| page 8 says it should be periodically reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| and, if warranted by changed conditions, amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| This review should occur every three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| beginning with the third anniversary of the effective date of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| And I switched to the effective date of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| We've heard that argument many times over the past four or five years I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| The growth policy plan has not been updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| It's not a decision of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| The decision before this commission now is whether to approve the motion that was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| or to deny that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| If the applicant does not like that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| he has the opportunity to request another zone before the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| because they are the determining body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| or he can withdraw the request prior to its consideration by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3073)|
| 0:51:28| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| So, are we supposed to vote on this EC or LI?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| Since we changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| The chair has called for a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| The commission can vote to approve or to deny that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| If the motion is denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| there is an opportunity for another motion to take another action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| Could the applicant just withdraw before we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| I mean, if he chose not to want this zone on his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| that's what I'm trying to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| He doesn't have to take it to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| We can say EC, and if he doesn't want EC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| he can withdraw it between now and the time it actually is put into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| If he doesn't want it, we'll recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| Or he can make his case to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| Which, at that point, he can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| never mind, I don't want any zoning on us, leave it agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| Or he can say, okay, EC's fine, and we can go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| So, Madam Chair, call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| And Commissioner Roth, your light's on, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| Okay, so the motion is to approve EC Employment Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| The motion was made by Commissioner Clancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| and seconded by Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| And I think that you understand that your next step is at county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| Thank you to everyone for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| Next on our agenda is item number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| Applicant is Sheila Proffitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| The location is the north side of Mineral Springs Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| east of Whittlesprings Road and North Broadway Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| Present zoning is O1, which is office, medical and related services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| and RP1, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| The zoning requested is O office in the city's new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3213)|
| 0:53:40| The existing land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| Proposed use is a community center for neighborhood use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| Staff recommendation is to deny office district zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| because it does not meet the location criteria for office zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| based on the sector plan's description of that criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| and because it is not compatible with the adjacent residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| and could have a potential negative impact on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| I'm representing Ms. Proffitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| Sir, would you like to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| I'll go first to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| I have signed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| My name is Matthew Higdon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| I reside at 2811 Mineral Springs Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| which is adjacent to this property there to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| I also hold an easement across the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| which gives me the only vehicle access I have to my garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| and to the rear of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| I'm here to ask that you deny this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| I appreciate earlier this year the recognition by planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| in the recode and actual process that the past zoning has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| inconsistent at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| and I strongly support the new zone for low-density residential use here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| I'm also pleased that the recommendation today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| and the staff support stands by this recode zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| and that they request that you deny this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| My neighbors and I are strongly we completely agree with the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3319)|
| 0:55:26| We do not believe that the request meets the location requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| and we feel that there will be negative effects upon us if this is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| As you can see on the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| an office zone would be situated on a lot between my house and my neighbor's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| It would be the only office lot on the north side of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| where there are 13 residences that have been there for 70 years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| My home is almost 95 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| Because it sits mid-block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| we believe that a zone there would split the character of our street in half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| creating two separate residential-type zones there on that side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| I've been looking at zoning maps on KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| and there is nothing like this in the city and in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| We're just asking for some consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| and that the same consideration provided elsewhere is provided here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| One point I'd like to make, across the street on the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| and I'm not sure it's in the staff report—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| across the street on the large office zone property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| the approved use of that in the future is for residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| Last year, the Planning Commission approved the Helen Ross McNabb Center request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| to use that for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| While at the time they didn't rezone that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| the use, the future use, would be more consistent with a residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| and it would make this proposal less consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| It would effectively isolate the proposed office lot at 2736| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| from office areas that are closer down there to Whittle Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| Also mentioned in the staff report, which I can attest to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| is the steepness of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| There are other problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| The steepness creates some stormwater issues that would have to be overcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| The easement that I hold actually crosses the property from the east to the west side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3441)|
| 0:57:30| and I'm not the only holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| There are several members, several residents that hold that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| That's an additional issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| The road is very narrow at this point of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| and the fact that it's on a dead end is also problematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| from the perspective of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| We don't even have a turnaround spot on the street there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| We do not support this new community center idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3467)|
| 0:57:54| We fear that it could perhaps even create worse impacts to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| than a typical day-use office-type development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| And, well, frankly, there's been a lot of uncertainty in this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| that I can attest to for a number of years, and we have not known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| I think this is probably the third idea that's been flown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| and we would just sort of like some certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| We don't know how this would affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| As a case in point, as an example, parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| Adjoining neighbors would not know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| or do not know whether parking would be beside us and behind us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| or on a hill slope above us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| I'm in a situation where the zone could create the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| that the only access I have to my garage is through an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| or community center parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| And so I believe that this is the kind of conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| that our plans and our zoning ordinances are intended to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| That's why I was pleased with the recode Knoxville map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| The low-density residential zoning resolves these conflicts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| provides residents some certainty, some predictability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| And so I ask again, I appreciate the work of the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| I ask that you accept their recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| and consider the wishes of residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| on Mineral Springs Avenue and please deny the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| Thank you, Mr. Hickin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| You timed that really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| You had 18 seconds left, and you can reserve that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| Sir, if you haven't already, please write down your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| I have signed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| My name is Dan Crum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| Could you pull the microphone down a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| I already signed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| My name is Dan Crum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| I live at 1919 Emma Lane in Maryville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| I'm an investing partner with Ms. Proffitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| She could not be here today because she's ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| The plan was to create some kind of a multi-venue type community facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3592)|
| 0:59:59| Ms. Proffitt has been looking at years for quite some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| to figure out how she can take advantage of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| and to help the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| Once we met, I came up with the idea of a community craft center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3609)|
| 1:00:16| slash educational multi-purpose venue that would include woodworking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3616)|
| 1:00:23| maybe expand it later on in the future to ceramics, painting, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3623)|
| 1:00:29| We have one gentleman has reached out to Ms. Proffitt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| has also looked at using this as a meditation place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| to do health meditation and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| Our interest is partly because of the history of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| It's Mineral Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| Mineral Springs dates back to the resort for a long history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| It's something we wanted to incorporate into this venue to bring back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| or at least make sure that that history is not lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| We look at the hillside as value to the venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| because there's a green space that we want to keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| I know at this time both lots, the lot above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| and there's an easement on the lower property to get up to that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| We're only looking at a facility probably about 8,000 square feet, tops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| which would accommodate any kind of venues or events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| that other organizations might want to share,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| including AA, weddings, graduation parties, or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3692)|
| 1:01:39| We also look at it as a venue that can support the East Tennessee Woodworkers Guild,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3699)|
| 1:01:46| youth groups, 4-H, scouting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| in encouraging more education in crafts such as woodworking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| These are skills that are no longer taught in high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| A lot of schools have shut down their shops, and that's disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| As an avid woodworker myself, there's very few places I can go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| to improve my skills, bring in the experts to show us finishing techniques| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3728)|
| 1:02:14| or joinery techniques or even marquetry, which is almost a lost art within itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3734)|
| 1:02:20| These are things we'd like to bring and offer to the community and to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| as a place or a home for them to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| Right now, East Tennessee Woodworkers Guild meets at many different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| They've had festivals or shows at the Knoxville Festival downtown at Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| where they've also allowed people to buy the projects that they created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| and demonstrated at the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| This is just another place where we can actually give a home to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| One of our goals is to bring in the experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| like the people who write articles for Wood magazine, Fine Woodworking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| and have them come in and do demonstrations, presentations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| and possibly even a hands-on teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| and then have people be able to go into a working woodshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| provided they've gone through the proper safety training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| to go in and actually spend a couple hours with that person over their shoulder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| to help them improve their own skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| Woodworkers never stop learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| Anybody in any kind of arts and craft never stops learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| I think this is a location where we can incorporate all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| Yes, is there some water drainage problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| I would not doubt that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| But at the same token, proper development of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| might address some of those drainage problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| That's one of the things that we would have to address and look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| We'd have to follow all the Knoxville code to protect that hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| and to make sure that we're not risking the environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| or what it takes for the city of Knoxville to meet their requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| This is something that Sheila and I don't have a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| We expect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| And we think it's necessary to maintain the integrity of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| including the integrity of the neighbor's properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| We're not looking at being a detriment to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| You have the section across the street from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| that covers about 50% of our entrance, which is an O1 designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3863)|
| 1:04:31| That is going to be for elderly living, senior living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| These are people who have time on their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| Here's a center they can go and spend time at and do stuff, crafts or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| There's nothing reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| We're trying to support everybody in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| This is an open venue that we will use for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| We're not going to restrict it, and that's what we're trying to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| is try to create a multipurpose facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| Is it O is the right choice? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| When we looked at this and applied the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| we only saw the O designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| Now there's three O designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| And speaking to Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| Thank you very much, Mr. Crum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Your time is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| That's all right. That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| Once again, the monthly statement that if it's rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3923)|
| 1:05:30| the use permitted in that zoning district would be permitted, so we can't rely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| And further note, some of the uses Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| Crum mentioned is desiring on that property would not be permitted in the office designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| So if it is rezoned, I would ask that he and Miss profit work closely with the staff to identify permitted uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3942)|
| 1:05:49| and make sure that the uses that they make of the property want to make of the property are indeed permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3949)|
| 1:05:57| Before we go to commission, did you have anything you'd like to add about this particular case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| Just to kind of piggyback on what Gerald was talking about, the woodworking in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| woodworking as a craft into furniture making and the presentations of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| that would be under the vocational uses in the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| which is only allowed in neighborhood commercial and commercial uses that are more intense than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| In terms of the ceramics and the other crafts, those would fall under arts and fitness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| The way that it is listed in the zoning ordinance, those are allowed in the office in the office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| However, just looking at the location criteria for what allows office uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| I'm sure Mr. Higdon was saying this particular property doesn't meet those location criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| which is the relatively flat sites. The use of office is a transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| which it wouldn't be in this case as it's situated between two residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| and being the fact that it's the only office zone north of that street and situated farther away from a collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| So we don't feel like it meets the location criteria, which is why we're recommending the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| Thank you. Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Crumb, I admire your vision. I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4026)|
| 1:07:12| You're right, woodworkers never start learning, stop learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4032)|
| 1:07:21| And this is speaking Mr. Clancy as a woodworker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| I would love to see something like that in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| I just really am not convinced that this piece of property is the right place for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4049)|
| 1:07:36| Traffic challenges to the grade and slope, I'm just not sure, and the road is very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4056)|
| 1:07:46| I was concerned years and years ago when they put the physical therapy place in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| I was concerned that that would be an issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| But I'm just not convinced that this is a good fit for your vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| I applaud your vision. I think Knoxville needs something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| but I'm just not sure this is the right place for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| Commissioner Hooten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| I hope nobody holds this against me, but I'm thinking like Art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| And so much to where I would make a motion that we deny this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4099)|
| 1:08:26| because it's not consistent with the location criteria for office zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| based on the sector plan description of that criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| because it's not compatible with adjacent residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| and could have a negative impact on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4115)|

| 1:08:39| We have a motion by Commissioner Hooten, a second by Commissioner Clancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| to deny office district zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4122)|

| 1:09:50| The existing land use is RR Rural Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| The proposed use is the extension of residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| The density proposed is one to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4199)|

| 1:10:12| amending the Northwest County Sector Plan to LDR Low Density Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| and HP Hillside Protection land use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| due to trends in population growth in the sector per attached resolution, Exhibit A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| and approve PR Planned Residential up to four dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| which is consistent with the requested LDR Low Density Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| sector plan designation and the surrounding zoning subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| Of note, the applicant requested up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4244)|

| 1:10:50| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| Have you already written down your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| No, ma'am, but I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| Drew Statton, PO Box 11315, Knoxville, Tennessee 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| And we respectfully request the approval of staff's recommendation on both these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| And if you'll go ahead and write down your name and address while we take this to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| I'd like to make a motion that we approve Adoption Resolution 12B19SP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| amending the Northwest County Sector Plan to LDR Low Density Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| and HP Hillside Protection land use designations due to the trends in population growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| in the sector per the Attached Resolution Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| And, Ms. Albertson, thank you very much for including the reason for making the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| That is very helpful for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| Of course, as a commissioner, if you have a difference of opinion as far as what the reasoning is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| you can always change that, but I think this is a recommendation by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| And thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| So we have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| to adopt the resolution amending the Northwest County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| Motion to approve planned residential up to four dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| which is consistent with the requested LDR Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| to approve the PR planned residential up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| I see no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| And we're on to agenda number 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| The applicant is Randy Gennard, CAFE International LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| The location is the east side of Beverly Road, east of the terminus of Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| north of I-640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| Approximate size of the tract is 80.37 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| Present zoning is I-Industrial, RB-General Residential, and F-Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| The zoning requested is PR planned residential and F-Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| Existing land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| Proposed use is 210 attached dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| The density proposed is 3.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| And the staff recommendation is to approve PR planned residential zoning with a density of 2.53 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4413)|
| 1:13:42| because it is consistent with the North City Sector Plan's LDR designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4422)|
| 1:13:48| and because the proposed development meets the intent of the PR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Mr. King, would you like to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| Don't start your clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| I want the opposition to go first, but I'd like to do a little bit of introducing some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| In connection with this matter, we have Mr. Gennard, the developer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| We have Mr. Fulgen with the engineering company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| Ms. Eisenberg, who's a real estate broker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| And then we have, as our consultant, Mike Rousseau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4465)|
| 1:14:33| We're in agreement generally with the staff recommendation, except for how the acreage is calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| I'll talk about that in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| I want to yield now, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| I think it would probably be good to have the staff report early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4488)|
| 1:14:54| because I think it may deal with a number of issues that are going to be raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| And then let the opponents go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| Ms. Portier, do you agree with that assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| that you would like to make a presentation before you hear from the opposition or the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| Actually, I was having trouble understanding Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| so I was just consulting with Mike to see what it was he was disagreeing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| So if someone could let me know what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| He said you should go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| He suggested that we hear a staff report before the opposition or him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| And I just wanted to say, do you agree with that assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| I'm happy to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| So staff's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| The following measures to increase safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| and preserve sensitive land on the steep slopes and along the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| First is to eliminate the two clusters of units closest to the entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| That would be seven units total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| It's units 1 through 4 and 208 through 210.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| Extend the boulevard to increase safety at the development entry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| in lieu of a second access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| The length of the boulevard would be determined during the development review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| Grading of steep slopes shall be kept to a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| and development shall not occur in the floodplains or the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| Staff report includes a description of the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| The site contains land in a FEMA floodway and floodplains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| There's both 500 and 100 years on the northern portion of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| and there's a steep slope in the hillside and ridgetop protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| on the southern portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| If the rezoning is approved as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| the property as proposed would become a cluster development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| with 210 lots contained in the central portion of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| between the floodplains and the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| And that's Exhibit A, your contextual images and your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| The development will leave the southeastern portion of the site largely undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| The undisturbed area is planned to begin approximately 12 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| from the lots proposed on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| The applicant is donating 16 acres of land and the floodplain to Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| And a letter from Legacy Parks accepting the land was submitted as part of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| It's actually a negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| The development will not encompass the FEMA floodway or floodplains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| and will leave these areas undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| As proposed, the development will provide a deep buffer of existing vegetation on the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| leading up to the single-family detached homes to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| There is a walking trail proposed for the perimeter of the remaining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| As proposed, the lot lines are situated approximately 50 feet farther| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| from the hillside protection area on the southeastern side of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| than the previous site plan which was submitted in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| The development will utilize permeable pavers for the internal roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| There were neighborhood concerns about flooding and about the bridge that we received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| that you all are familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| I don't know, did the applicant, did you need me to go on or is that, did you just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| I'll add just a bit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| I think that was a thorough description of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| Again, the reminder that we can't rely on a plan submitted now at the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4678)|
| 1:18:04| because the rezoning plan residential would allow anything that this commission approves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4684)|
| 1:18:11| upon submittal of the development concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| Staff did try to write conditions that would ensure, to the extent we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| at the rezoning stage that the development of the property would comply with the plan that's submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| The PR zoning is designed to accommodate both interesting approaches and interesting properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4705)|
| 1:18:34| and this is certainly an interesting and challenging property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| The developer and the information they submitted did submit a plan that meets the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4717)|
| 1:18:45| certainly meets and in many cases exceeds the intent of the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| The burden if this property is rezoned is again placed on the staff, the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| and the developer to follow through with the development plan that's been presented at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| Again, we can't rely totally on that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| They are moving in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| They have provided the documentation with regard to working with Legacy Parks to protect the floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4746)|
| 1:19:14| not just the floodway but the floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| and as stated at the Planning Commission's agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| development of the floodplain is permitted if structures are elevated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| This goes beyond what the flood regulations require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| They have committed to protecting the steeper portions of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| That will have to be made a part of the plan review and approval if the rezoning is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4772)|
| 1:19:41| Again, I caution you and everyone that we can't rely totally on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| but if the commission does agree and recommend rezoning of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| and the City Council approves that rezoning, the burden is, again, upon us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| on us to ensure that the plan and the commitments made by the developer to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| and to us are implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| I just want to check with the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| Did you want to speak before we hear from the opposition and from the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| Let's go to the opposition first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| Well, it's up to the applicant, but you want to hear from them before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| Yeah, I'd like to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| Okay, because I know you had your lights on, or you would have had your light on if your light was working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| I believe opposition, the applicant had asked for you to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| And did you write down your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| My name is Charles Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| I'm the attorney for the many residents and neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| that are going to be adversely impacted by this development if the rezoning is granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4846)|
| 1:20:53| My family and I also live in the same neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| We live at 4801 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| Some of the neighborhoods that are opposing this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| include Alice Bell Spring Hill neighborhood, Fountain City Town Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| the Oakwood Lincoln neighborhood, Tazewell Pike Beverly Station neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| and the Fairmont Emeryland neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| And to understand why so many residents, so many neighborhoods and associations oppose this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4876)|
| 1:21:22| it's important to look back at the history of this rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| because it's been around a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| This rezoning request started back in March 2018, almost two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| At that time, before the March 2018 MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4894)|
| 1:21:40| the MPC staff made a recommendation that the rezoning be limited to one unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4900)|
| 1:21:49| because of all these problems that we're going to talk about in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4909)|
| 1:21:55| One unit per acre, and that went to the MPC meeting in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| And what's interesting is at that MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| and we've got the recording of what took place there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| what's interesting is some of the comments made by commissioners at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| For example, I've written some down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| One commissioner said, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| This is the worst piece of undeveloped property that has ever come before the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4932)|
| 1:22:18| Another commissioner said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| There are severe constraints on this property, flooding and slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| And then a third commissioner said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| When you talk about rough properties, this is about as rough as any I have ever seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| Everyone recognized from the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| that this was a terrible piece of property to be developed as a residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| Notwithstanding, the MPC did not follow its staff's recommendation of one unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4959)|
| 1:22:46| and you went ahead and rezoned it PR with a density of 2.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| When it came before the county commission in June of 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| over 200 of my neighbors showed up at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| It was a long, drawn-out meeting. It went past midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| But after all of the arguments and the yelling and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| finally the county commission made a motion to grant the PR change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| but limit it to 100 units, which works out about 1.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=4992)|
| 1:23:20| The motion was second, and then immediately the developer ran forward and withdrew his motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5000)|
| 1:23:26| because obviously he saw the writing on the wall and he knew it was going to be granted at 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| The developer then waited 18 months to refile, and he waited until December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| I assume because he thought by doing it now with the holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| there'd be less opposition, but that's not going to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| The reason that so many people oppose this has been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| It has to do with the slope, the floodplain, the soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| This is built on a ridge. There's a floodplain below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| Water's going to run off, increase flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| Beverly Road has a tiny bridge there that only one vehicle at a time can come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5036)|
| 1:24:02| I heard it mentioned that you're going to let them use roadways made out of permeable pavers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| but if you look at the soil report, which has been submitted to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| there's four kinds of soil there, and three of them are unsuitable for any development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| because water cannot be absorbed into the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| So it doesn't matter whether you put pavers or not, water's going to run off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| But the biggest problem is Beverly Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| There's some photographs that we submitted to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| and if you'll look at them, about two or three times a year, Beverly Road floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| If you look at the photographs dated in February of 2019, this is a typical flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| and right there is where the entrance to the development's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| It only has one entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| I understand that you're going to require them to use a boulevard-type entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| but there's only going to be one entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| and what that means is two or three times a year this development's going to be isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| If someone has a medical emergency, no ambulance is going to be able to get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| If someone's house catches on fire, no fire truck's going to get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| If someone has to pick the kids up at school, they're not going to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| That's the reason that my clients oppose this so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5106)|
| 1:25:11| I've heard people talk about, well, the developer should be complimented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| for trying to do something with such a bad piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| and yes, maybe he should, but with all respect, it's like putting lipstick on a pig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| It's still a pig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| There are some developments that should never be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| or some pieces of property that should never be developed residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| But my clients are willing, as a compromise, to allow this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| if the MPC will go back to its original staff recommendation of March 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5135)|
| 1:25:41| and limit it to one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| Thank you, Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| Can we hear from the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5148)|
| 1:25:58| Mr. King, are you going to be the only one speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| I understand you have other folks there available as resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| but are you going to be the only one speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| So far as I know, unless some question is asked that they know the answer to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| then I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5171)|
| 1:26:12| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| So you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| Needless to say, there's a lot to respond, but I'm going to try to limit mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| You do need to name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| I'm going to limit mine as best as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| John King, Post Office Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5187)|
| 1:26:35| We've heard about all the problems in dressing up a pig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| If that's what you've got to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| and you need to put the best face on that pig, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| That's what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| It's taken some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| Our proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| and the staff's recommended approval results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| in the least amount of land disturbance possible to do a development on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5216)|
| 1:27:04| It will be very minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| We have the utilities available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| Now they will be concentrated in so far as their use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| which will result in a lower or less energy consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5235)|
| 1:27:21| You get preservation of open space with the inclusion of legacy parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5241)|
| 1:27:32| We have no adverse impact on the creek and the flooding issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| There will be some detention, and by use of detention and infiltration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5258)|
| 1:27:46| the engineering people tell me, Mr. Fulgham is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| that that will result in reducing peak flow on this property and or to the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5271)|
| 1:28:01| We're installing and including walking trail and other amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| We will be protecting the hillside and ridgetops, according to your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5286)|
| 1:28:12| We'll have the least effect on the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| of any residential development that exists in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| The student yield is estimated to be five in number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| The schools are there to provide that service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| but that five does not represent a net addition of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| I see no problem with that whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| The schools are there and include private schools availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| This assures reasonable residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| and this body's opportunity to review the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| Rezoning is consistent with the adopted sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| We have to meet stormwater requirements and the engineering requirements by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5338)|
| 1:29:05| We have to come back to this body with a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| and have it approved that will assure protection under the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5350)|
| 1:29:16| and ridgetop stipulations and no development in the FEMA floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5356)|
| 1:29:24| Our development plan will also include possible recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5364)|
| 1:29:31| regarding mitigation of the traffic issues identified by that traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5371)|
| 1:29:37| They will be, again, made part of the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| at the time we come forward with a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| We have shown to our adversaries and to members of this body the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5385)|
| 1:29:51| and the outline of it that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| I think we also submitted that material to staff in connection with their analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5394)|
| 1:30:03| We do all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| The last point would be we do that in an attempt to get rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5408)|
| 1:30:16| that will eliminate the industrial and the high-density apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5416)|
| 1:30:26| that would otherwise be the only development to occur on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| We asked for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| The only thing we differ with staff on is we don't have a full survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5434)|
| 1:30:40| to get the total number of acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| For that reason, we've asked for a motion, and we are asking for a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| for rezoning to PR at three-and-a-half units to the acre but no more than 210 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5449)|
| 1:31:01| Recommendation, we lose seven units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| We'd like an opportunity to maybe capture those back by moving those units somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5465)|
| 1:31:12| We'll come to you with a concept plan on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| but we would prefer a motion that says three-and-a-half units to the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| subject to a maximum number of units on this property of 210| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| because we've got this possible issue about how many acres there are actually there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5487)|
| 1:31:33| That's my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| And we have zero time remaining for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| You did time that very well, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| Mr. Green, this looks like a perfect project for the planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5507)|
| 1:31:55| New ordinance that the County Commission is moving forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| It would be an appropriate location for application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| I guess I'm not opposed to the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| but my concern is we have a letter from the Urban Wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5526)|
| 1:32:12| and not the Urban Wilderness but Carol Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| It's not exactly what I call fixed in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| It's very open, so it's not clear it's going to actually occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5540)|
| 1:32:30| I guess I would like to see if we could move this thing forward to a planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| and maybe delay this for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5555)|
| 1:32:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| Commissioner Quinn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| Do you want to reflect to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| That would make the applicant willing to agree to that review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5567)|
| 1:32:56| but staff would be willing to work with the applicant on that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| so directed by the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| Okay, I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| That's a whole other process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| and they'd have to go through the application process again, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| I'm going to make a motion that we approve PR plan residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| with a density of 3.5 dwelling units an acre, not to exceed 210 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5606)|
| 1:33:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| a second by Commissioner Roth to approve the planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5618)|
| 1:33:44| with a density of 3.5, not to exceed 210 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| We still do have other commissioners that would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| How do you get 3.5 and limit it to 210?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5634)|
| 1:34:06| Why 3.5 when probably 2.7 would do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| Well, it depends on, and staff has done a calculation on slope and floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| It depends on what that number comes out to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| Without an accurate survey, I guess there's some ambiguity there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| which is why I made my motion to 3.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| so that it gives the developer the best opportunity to make use of what Landy can make use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5671)|
| 1:34:38| and still get the amenities that we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5678)|
| 1:34:46| I understand that, but I don't see where tying 210 to 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5686)|
| 1:34:56| 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| If you look at the slope analysis and what they say the developable land is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| 210 comes out to about 3.47| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| based on what they used as calculations on slope and floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5710)|
| 1:35:18| 2.73 won't get it if that calculation changes any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5718)|
| 1:35:24| and depending on what the calculation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| And there's also, as Mr. King said, a question about the actual acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| We're depending on the tax maps now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| I'll try to interpret his request as that they want, apparently to make the project viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5738)|
| 1:35:46| they need 210 units, so they want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| And so maybe if it helps to clarify things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| maybe Commissioner Clancy would amend his motion to just say not to exceed 210 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5754)|
| 1:36:01| If that helps Commissioner Graf, I'm just trying to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| But we have to put some type of density in there, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| We do not have to include a density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| You can do the number of units, I think, according to our esteemed counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| I'll amend my motion to state that approved PR plan residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5779)|
| 1:36:25| not to exceed 210 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| 210 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| 210 dwelling units total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| Totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| We're going to have skyscrapers here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| Commissioner Roth, I believe you were the second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| Are you in agreement with that modification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| I'll amend my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| I had a question about the 3.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| and I'm still trying to think about the 210 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| Looking at with the staff recommendation, how many units was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5826)|
| 1:37:12| With the staff recommendation, it was 203, and that was eliminating, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5832)|
| 1:37:19| we're doing what we tell you not to do, relying upon a plan that was submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| but the plan that was submitted had units near the front that would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| Some of them were in what we considered to be a low spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| and also it prevented the extension of the boulevard to the extent that we would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| in order to provide assurance for a safer entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5859)|
| 1:37:45| I will say that I'm not as opposed to the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| considering the fact that this plan is staying totally out of the flood zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| even though they have the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| even though we're not supposed to be paying attention to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| I think if it comes back to us with something very similar to what we're seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| that that looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| Again, I put the burden upon us, the staff and the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| the developer and the community, if this is approved at City County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5886)|
| 1:38:11| that as we review that development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| that we're very cognizant of the commitments that have been made by the development team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| and the concerns expressed here and the promises made to make sure that those are made real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5900)|
| 1:38:26| by the development plan for the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| Just quickly, I would be totally opposed to 210 if it comes back and it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| I do have a question for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| I was wondering, is this going to be a phased development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| like a Phase I, a Phase II, a Phase III?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5925)|
| 1:38:58| In answer to your question, we anticipate it's probably going to be a phased project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| It's sort of long and down the center of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| so we expect in all probability it will be phased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| I see no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| We do have a motion on the table by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| to approve planned residential zoning not to exceed a total of 210 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5965)|
| 1:39:34| because it is consistent with the North City Sector Plan, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5974)|
| 1:39:39| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| We look forward to seeing this concept plan when you have it next time we're seeing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5985)|
| 1:39:57| Commission, is it time for recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| We're going to take a 15-minute recess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| and I'm sorry for those that are sitting there waiting for your agenda item to come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| but we do have a few more items on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| and we're going to take a 15-minute recess until, what is it, 3.09?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6011)|
| 1:40:20| 3.24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| 3.24, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| And I might even give you an extra minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6025)|
| 1:40:33| We'll go ahead and get started again with agenda item number 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| This is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| The applicant is Masonic Investments, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| The location is the north side of Ball Camp Pike, east of Middlebrook Pike intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6045)|
| 1:40:52| Approximate size of the tract is 4.25 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| The present zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| The zoning requested is P.R., planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| Existing land use is R.R., rural residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| and the proposed use is single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| The density proposed is one to five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| and the staff recommendation is to approve P.R., planned residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| up to five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| which is consistent with the sector plan designation of LDR for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6088)|
| 1:41:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| Drew Statton, PO Box 11315, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| I would just like to mention that we respectfully request the approval of staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| So did you ‑‑ okay, you obviously just did yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| Okay, ma'am, you can come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6113)|
| 1:42:01| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| I'm Lisa Kerr, and my address is 8657 Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6123)|
| 1:42:10| I'm opposing for this planned residential for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| The fact that I do live on Ball Camp Pike for the past 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| nothing has been developed from where I live to Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6139)|
| 1:42:26| Traffic on Ball Camp Pike is getting ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| We have an elementary school just right there on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| My children went to that school, but I did not have any kind of busing system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6154)|
| 1:42:41| so if my car broke down, I had to rely on neighbors or friends to take my kids to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6161)|
| 1:42:49| Another issue with this property, this was actually my mamaw's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| We didn't know this land was going for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| My aunt lives out in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| She didn't tell anybody about this property going for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| We saw the for sale went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| The house already had a bid on the day before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| so nobody really knew that this property was going for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| When I called the real estate agent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| they told me that they were planning to put this as a planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| and my fight for this is we can't really support any kind of residential going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6201)|
| 1:43:28| on that area of Ball Camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| and the fact that even yesterday, the EMS and fire department were trying to get by through a two-lane road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6210)|
| 1:43:39| very highly congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| Comes 7 to 9 o'clock, and then comes 3.30, 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| That railroad track comes, or the train,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| that traffic can be backed up all the way off from Middlebrook, even lower road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6231)|
| 1:44:00| With any kind of development going on there, the traffic is just going to get a lot more dense and worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6240)|
| 1:44:08| I, myself, pray to God every time I try to turn left on from Ball Camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| most of the time I have to turn right because the traffic itself is dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| The other day when I went to the properties to check it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| just to try to get out of the property to turn left was a hassle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| It took me a good five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| I don't see how they're going to put a planned residential in here when the traffic is completely densed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6270)|
| 1:44:38| I don't know what else to say, but this is what I'm arguing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| Just stay close because some of the commissioners may have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| I want to make a motion to approve PR planned residential up to five dwellings per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6293)|
| 1:45:00| consistent with the sector plan designation of LDR for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, a second by Commissioner Clancy to approve the planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6305)|
| 1:45:11| We do have some lights on and I also have some questions, so we are not going to vote on this quite yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6311)|
| 1:45:17| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| Lisa, I hear what you're saying and I live out there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| I live right beside this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| Unfortunately, I'm not opposed to developing this property because I think it makes sense with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6329)|
| 1:45:38| and the plans that are in place, but also I'd like to hear from county engineering about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6338)|
| 1:45:48| for the last couple of years we've been saying that ball camp is going to be widened from Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| all the way to Schott Road and it was supposed to start a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| Do we have any idea of an update on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| They promised a road 17 years ago and actually that property was paid off too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| Yeah, I feel your pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| I've been there 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| Aaron Fritz with the traffic engineering is going to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6374)|
| 1:46:22| Unfortunately, Commissioner Roth, I'm probably going to tell you the same thing again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6382)|
| 1:46:27| We've ran into some environmental issues where we actually have to own some certain pieces of drainage easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6387)|
| 1:46:32| where we had drainage easements prior to, but we are still looking to get all of that 100% sorted out in the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6392)|
| 1:46:40| and hopefully bid it for construction probably late spring, summer of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| Okay, so looking to start another year and a half or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| Probably less than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| We'll actually be out there turning dirt, but I don't know how many miles the project is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6411)|
| 1:46:57| so when they actually start construction on this area, it's kind of all up for grabs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| because we're suspecting it'll take probably three years to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| Ms. Carr, one thing else I'd like to say to you is unfortunately in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| most of Knox County roads are not wide enough for development to take place in most people's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6432)|
| 1:47:21| but unfortunately if we ruled on it, if we didn't, if we just stopped development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| because the roads weren't wide enough or we thought there was too much traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| there wouldn't be any development at all, so I'll support this motion for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| I think it is difficult when we're told that things are going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6455)|
| 1:47:42| or infrastructure is going to be changing and we make some of our decisions based on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| and then it doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| People in the community are promised this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| 17 years, did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| Yes, it was promised 17 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| And Mamaw was hoping to see this thing go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| She has died and we've not seen no road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| Even my neighbor has passed away seeing no road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| I'm afraid I will be passing away with no road, or my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| And that is, talk to your commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6493)|
| 1:48:20| Okay, we do have a motion on the table by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| a second by Commissioner Clancy to approve this at up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6503)|
| 1:48:29| I see no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| And I do hope that the county will come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| Three years, is that what I heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| That things will start happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| Dirt will be moved in the spring and three years, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| So hang around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| Next on the agenda is item number 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| This is a concept used on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| The Highlands at Copeland, FKA Copeland Heights, SD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| Phase 2, Primos Land Company, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6549)|
| 1:49:15| The location is the east side of East Copeland Drive, north side of Greenwell Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6555)|
| 1:49:21| west side of Pedigo Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| The zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| The existing land use is vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| The proposed use is detached residential lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| The number of lots is 148.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| There are three subdivision variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| Staff recommendation, there will be three motions, three votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6581)|
| 1:49:45| Staff recommendation is to approve variances one through three because topographic constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6585)|
| 1:49:51| and site conditions restrict compliance with subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| Also to approve the concept plan subject to nine conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| and also to approve the request for up to 148 detached dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6604)|
| 1:50:12| and a reduction of the peripheral setback to 25 foot for lots 79 through 100 subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6612)|
| 1:50:21| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| Applicant, would you like to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| Opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| My name is Johnny Temple and I live at 1324 Grand Colony Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| which is directly across from the main entrance to phase two of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| I'm not here, I'm not specifically opposed to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| We certainly understand it has been rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| I do, I am here with some concerns that I would like to express to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6654)|
| 1:51:02| I have sent photographs to Mike Reynolds on staff addressing some of these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6662)|
| 1:51:09| First of all, we feel that the property was posted for this hearing improperly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6669)|
| 1:51:15| The public notice sign was put on East Copeland Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| which is a very secondary road on the backside of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6677)|
| 1:51:23| It's my understanding that requirements are that the property be posted on the most highly trafficked road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6683)|
| 1:51:32| which would be Pedigo Road or at least Greenwell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| The sign was moved to Pedigo Road just a few days ago from its prior location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6696)|
| 1:51:45| If it had been posted there originally, then probably there potentially would be more people here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6705)|
| 1:51:53| But moving on beyond that point, phase one is currently under development now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6713)|
| 1:52:01| It's down at the other end of the property from what's shown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6721)|
| 1:52:07| I guess it would be down on the west, northwest end maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6727)|
| 1:52:12| One of my concerns is that it was our understanding that the property would have to have screening on Pedigo Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6732)|
| 1:52:19| when the rezoning hearing took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| I had sent Mike a photograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| The houses that have been built along Pedigo Road, there appears to be no screening to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6747)|
| 1:52:33| One of the houses has built a fence right up to the property line on Pedigo Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6753)|
| 1:52:39| It appeared to me that the right-of-way line and the fence line are just a few feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6759)|
| 1:52:47| Looking at phase two, going back and looking at what's already occurred in phase one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| we are very concerned that screening has not taken place per development requirements, planning commission requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6773)|
| 1:53:02| I want to make sure that that is in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| I understand that there are bonds in place, but it's a little unclear to me when they might be exercised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6785)|
| 1:53:11| if the developer does not fulfill the requirements of this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6791)|
| 1:53:21| Moving on to phase two, we certainly are concerned that that has not happened in phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6801)|
| 1:53:29| We understood that sidewalks and perhaps a greenway would be installed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6809)|
| 1:53:36| Currently, to date, there have been no sidewalks that I can see that have been installed in phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6816)|
| 1:53:43| Just a point of clarification, I understand that certain things are done at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6823)|
| 1:53:49| and not during process of the construction process, but we just want to note those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6829)|
| 1:53:57| Also, at the intersection of Pedigo and Greenwell Road, it's a very bad intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6837)|
| 1:54:06| There is a fence line that runs east to west right at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| There's been numerous traffic accidents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| It's my understanding that the developer will possibly remove that fence line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6854)|
| 1:54:20| and try to improve visibility at that intersection to minimize the potential for hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6860)|
| 1:54:27| My wife has had a wreck right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| People just don't seem to recognize the stop signs from the north and south specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6869)|
| 1:54:41| Again, I'm not here opposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| I know it's been rezoned, but we do want to make sure that as part of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6884)|
| 1:54:50| that the subdivision regulations are adhered to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| and I would like to see if the developer would validate if and when those things will take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6895)|
| 1:55:05| Thank you, Mr. Temple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| Mr. Sanderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| I'll sign in in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| I completely respect Mr. Temple's concerns and do have a kind of answer or solution for each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6919)|
| 1:55:27| The screening and this landscape buffer is a new thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| I don't know when Knox County actually adopted it, but I think we might be the first one to actually enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6931)|
| 1:55:37| We have every intention of installing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| The delay right now is we're putting yards in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| and as we finish the yards and we get the final grade of these yards done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| we will go back and install this right-of-way or this landscape buffer inside the landscape easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6946)|
| 1:55:53| There is a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| They have to go through the HOA approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| We made sure that the landscape buffer or future landscape buffer that's going to be installed is outside the fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6957)|
| 1:56:05| so we will be installing that landscape buffer on the outside of the fence in between Pedigree and the fence line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6965)|
| 1:56:11| So the screening is going to happen, not to just make excuses, but just weather and bad time for planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6971)|
| 1:56:17| and just putting final grade and swells and drainage and everything on the development has limited us as far as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6977)|
| 1:56:23| you know, shaping a landscape buffer how we'd actually want to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| We know this is a requirement, and we will make sure this happens along with Phase 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6988)|
| 1:56:33| We'll install it, weather permitting, final grade, and certain other things, but, yes, it will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| Sidewalks we install as we pour driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| They're only on one side of the road, so we currently have built out one side of the road that does not have installed sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7001)|
| 1:56:48| and the other side will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| We're currently coming back down that road and installing sidewalks as we pour the driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7009)|
| 1:56:55| The intersection at Pedigo and Greenwell, that will be an area of a detention pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7015)|
| 1:57:02| and all that will have to be cleared, lowered, installed properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| So, yes, that should improve, and obviously we'll work with Knox County to make sure sight of distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| and there's no other impeding traffic problems there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| I think that's covered everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| Again, I appreciate his coming forth and holding developers accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| Y'all know our family's been doing this for a long time, and we want to continue to do it for generations to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7043)|
| 1:57:30| I'll save the rest of my time and thank y'all for y'all's time and service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| and ask for y'all to approve this subdivision per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7060)|
| 1:57:41| Mr. Temple, I just want to make sure you were able to hear everything that Mr. Sanderson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| because he did address all your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| Yes, I was, and as long as that is actually fulfilled as an end result, then, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7069)|
| 1:57:57| And I'm certain, too, while you're here, you can exchange contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| Mr. Sanderson, I've noticed, is very good about answering questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| and staying in contact with the people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| Yes, I'd like to make a motion that we approve variances 1 through 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| because the topographic constraints and site conditions restrict compliance with subdivision regs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7096)|
| 1:58:22| and proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to approve the variances 1 through 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7108)|
| 1:58:34| Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| I was looking over the landscape buffering, and maybe we've mentioned it in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7121)|
| 1:58:47| but this one happens to mention the exact number of plants being planted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7127)|
| 1:58:52| and there's a total of 12 plants within 100 feet, and most of those plants are shrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7132)|
| 1:58:59| So it gives a distance between shrubs of about seven to eight feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| That's pretty sparse buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7143)|
| 1:59:08| Ms. Green, would you care to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| It's on Item 5 on the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| I suppose the only way I can address it is you're correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| and I'll let Mr. Reynolds provide additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| Yeah, so it requires two evergreen trees, two deciduous trees, and eight shrubs per 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| It's not meant to provide necessarily a complete screen from a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| but it is supposed to provide some type of landscape treatment along the edge of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7174)|
| 1:59:39| and they can cluster to some degree with that landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| so if they want to do something a little bit more interesting in one portion of the site, they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7182)|
| 1:59:47| It's just a matter of just trying to at least give them some parameters to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7187)|
| 1:59:52| We were mentioning shrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| It could be a dwarf nandina, which grows to about a foot wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7193)|
| 1:59:58| or an azalea, which gets to two to three feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| Commissioner Crowder, could you pull down your mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| It's just I have a problem with eight shrubs, watch shrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| As I was saying, if you planted dwarf nandinas, they get about a foot wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7209)|
| 2:00:16| I agree with the gentleman who spoke earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| If we're going to buffer something, it needs to be with more than eight shrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7219)|
| 2:00:27| One thing we can do, maybe we can work with Mr. Sanderson if he's willing to address the landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7227)|
| 2:00:36| and we can also work with Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| and even take some advice from the city's arborist with regard to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7239)|
| 2:00:45| I know the city has a recommended species list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| and maybe we can look at that and have that applicable to the county also in cases like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7248)|
| 2:00:56| which would, I think, address your concerns about dwarf nandinas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7256)|
| 2:01:01| as opposed to something that would work better in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| Mr. Temple, did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| Well, I think there's a difference between landscaping and screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7266)|
| 2:01:12| I think they can be two completely different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| I think landscaping can be nandinas or maybe a couple of evergreens every 20 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7276)|
| 2:01:24| combined with some low-level vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| But in my opinion, screening is something where you potentially would have evergreens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7287)|
| 2:01:35| that would grow to a height of 20 feet within two to three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7295)|
| 2:01:40| that would physically provide a visual barrier between a roadway and whatever you're trying to screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7300)|
| 2:01:49| Otherwise, what is the purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| There really is no purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| It makes it kind of look nicer when you have a few nandinas scattered along a ditch bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7314)|
| 2:02:00| But what is the real purpose if screening is the intent of the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7320)|
| 2:02:05| And this wasn't screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7325)|
| 2:02:06| It was, as Mr. Reynolds said, to create a landscaping area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| with a combination of evergreen trees and deciduous and some shrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7329)|
| 2:02:15| Based on Commissioner Crowder's comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7335)|
| 2:02:18| I do think we need to work on a recommended species list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7338)|
| 2:02:21| But it's to create just something a bit nicer and with that variety of landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7341)|
| 2:02:27| something that's more suitable for various habitat for birds or even small animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7347)|
| 2:02:33| and also to prevent what I see with those evergreen screens that one pest gets in or a bagworm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7353)|
| 2:02:42| and you've got a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| With the variety, it does not lend itself to being decimated by one disease or one pest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7364)|
| 2:02:53| Again, we're not trying to screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| We're trying to create a more pleasant landscaped area between the road and the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7375)|
| 2:03:03| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| I'm not necessarily saying I disagree that that's kind of sparse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| but in the past we've just simply said we required a landscape buffer and left it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7397)|
| 2:03:23| I don't remember us ever getting real specific about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7403)|
| 2:03:27| except for the fact they have to have a plan for us to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7407)|
| 2:03:33| when did we start saying how many trees and how many bushes per hundred feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| This was in phase one of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| The same landscaping requirements in there, so that's why it was carried into phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7419)|
| 2:03:46| With the phase one project, they did come in right after we implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7426)|
| 2:03:54| the new standard for double frontage lots where you have 150-foot depth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7434)|
| 2:03:58| or we had a staff policy where if you created a 25-foot common area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7438)|
| 2:04:05| then we considered that a separation is no longer double frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7445)|
| 2:04:09| With their project, it didn't work to have the 25-foot common area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| so we came up with an alternative solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| which was a 15-foot landscape easement that went across the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| In exchange for that, we just had a landscape treatment specified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7462)|
| 2:04:29| because if you have a 25-foot common area, there is technically no landscape requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7469)|
| 2:04:34| It's just you have a 25-foot common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7476)|
| 2:04:41| Okay, we do have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| a second by Commissioner Phillips to approve the variances one through three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| Commissioner Crowder? Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7489)|
| 2:04:54| I see no other lights on. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7494)|

| 2:07:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| We're on agenda item number 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7649)|
| 2:07:46| I don't see what to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7666)|
| 2:07:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| It is a final plat, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| I'll let.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7674)|
| 2:07:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| Here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7677)|
| 2:07:58| This is the application fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| Application fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| It's a subdivision on, near Phillips Avenue that a request for a variance in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7684)|
| 2:08:10| for a reduction in the right-of-way at the intersection of reduction from zero feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7690)|
| 2:08:19| or from 25 feet to zero feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| and the staff recommendation, based on the recommendation from engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| is for approval of the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| The applicant can provide the justification for the variance request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7708)|
| 2:08:37| The applicant present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| And engineering is also here to provide additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| And there is opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| Sir, do you want to go first or hear from the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| I'll speak first, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7730)|
| 2:08:51| My name is Greg Huddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| My address is 133 West Jackson Avenue in Knoxville, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7733)|
| 2:08:59| I'm representing Urban Cottages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| I'm one of the partners in that company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| So I think, and I'd love some clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| I think we are just addressing the variance to go from 25 feet of a turning radius to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7748)|
| 2:09:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7756)|
| 2:09:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7757)|
| 2:09:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| So that was, because of the subdivision request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| that was an automatic requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7763)|
| 2:09:28| And so we talked with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| The city engineering department agreed that that would not be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7772)|
| 2:09:36| And as you see, has agreed that zero would be adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| The neighborhood is a small-scale neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| that the roads would never really have that type of turning radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| So we then made the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7787)|
| 2:09:51| And if we're just dealing with the request for the turning radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| that's really all I have to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7798)|
| 2:09:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| Patty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7801)|
| 2:10:10| And did you already write down your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7810)|
| 2:10:17| Actually, I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| Your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7819)|
| 2:10:20| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| Patricia Berrier, 807 Phillips Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7821)|
| 2:10:26| This variance request to go from 25 foot to zero, my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7826)|
| 2:10:35| because the lot hasn't been divided yet into four lots yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7835)|
| 2:10:44| This would be the beginning of a process to get this small lot split in four lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7844)|
| 2:10:53| We, as a neighborhood, there are actually a few of us that are opposed to any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7853)|
| 2:11:02| high-density residential, which is what this would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7862)|
| 2:11:07| SW1 is a low-density single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7867)|
| 2:11:10| This lot originally had one house and a garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7870)|
| 2:11:13| allowing the variance for the lot would drastically harm the only four blocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7873)|
| 2:11:18| that are designated single-family in SW1 to future high-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7878)|
| 2:11:26| Allowing this variance to go to zero would, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7886)|
| 2:11:32| allow someone to possibly subdivide the lot and put more density in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7892)|
| 2:11:45| It's only four blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| We're single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| We have major issues with parking, traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7909)|
| 2:11:55| especially because of Severe Avenue becoming developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7915)|
| 2:12:02| So SW1, where this lot is, and it's not even a half an acre lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7922)|
| 2:12:11| the potential to increase density if it goes to a zero footage with radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7931)|
| 2:12:23| it would really create hardship not only on what we fought for for SW1 as a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7943)|
| 2:12:32| It just would be detrimental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| The school is across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7954)|
| 2:12:38| There's a lot of issues with the buses, parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7958)|
| 2:12:42| There is no parking, extra parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7962)|
| 2:12:49| I know that my neighbors, the Davises, Graham Beyer, Jenny MacArthur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7969)|
| 2:12:58| a lot of us are opposed to this here, and I believe there was an e-mail sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7978)|
| 2:13:05| I actually have an e-mail from Graham and from Sharon Clark and David Clark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7985)|
| 2:13:11| that they would be very willing to fight this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| This, to me, is just the beginning of trying to get this single-family lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=7996)|
| 2:13:22| or single-house lot increased for a higher density within the lowest density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8002)|
| 2:13:31| of the South Waterfront plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8011)|
| 2:13:34| There are seven districts, and District 1 is literally low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8014)|
| 2:13:47| And that's all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| But we oppose it, several of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8030)|
| 2:13:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8034)|
| 2:13:55| Sir, yes, you're more than welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8037)|
| 2:14:01| I guess the question on the radius was wondering if I should get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8041)|
| 2:14:07| other attributes of the lot, and since it was brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8047)|
| 2:14:10| I'll just briefly say that the SW1 in its documentation actually says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8050)|
| 2:14:17| and I quote, suggested building types include detached houses, cottages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| duplex houses, attached townhouses, and row houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8060)|
| 2:14:26| As an architect and a land planner, we actually felt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| though we could develop this lot as attached townhouses and row houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8069)|
| 2:14:34| we felt like the character of the neighborhood was more in keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8074)|
| 2:14:37| if we develop it with single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| So that's why we're doing small cottages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| We feel like it completely fits in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| It's actually what is stated in the SW1 form-based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8085)|
| 2:14:50| and we're meeting all the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| With the parking, we'll have to meet requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8092)|
| 2:14:54| Aesthetics, we'll have to meet requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8094)|
| 2:14:56| So that's just a little bit of response into the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8096)|
| 2:15:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8101)|
| 2:15:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8102)|
| 2:15:04| What is the minimum lot size in SW1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8104)|
| 2:15:13| The SW1, like the South Waterfront District in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8113)|
| 2:15:16| has maximum standards typically versus minimum standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| so there is no minimum lot size per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| There's lot coverage standards and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8122)|
| 2:15:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8128)|
| 2:15:30| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| Motion to approve final plat per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8131)|
| 2:15:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| a second by Commissioner Phillips to approve the final plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8139)|
| 2:15:42| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8142)|
| 2:15:46| And just kind of a little bit more of a clarification on final plats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| for those in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| We have very little leeway with regards to what we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8152)|
| 2:16:00| and cannot approve on final plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| The plat has been reviewed by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8163)|
| 2:16:07| and meets the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| and so we have very little leeway with regards to making any kind of denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8170)|
| 2:16:16| of any staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8176)|
| 2:16:20| Am I stating that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| Well, in the absence there being requests for a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| but in this case there is a request for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8186)|
| 2:16:28| Ordinarily, and what your chair is referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| is state statute limitation on final plats doesn't allow a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8191)|
| 2:16:36| They have to be acted on within a relatively short period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8196)|
| 2:16:40| from the time they're filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| and so you can't postpone in order to get things straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| But you do have the ability to deny a plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| even if it's in compliance with, let me back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8209)|
| 2:16:54| if a plat comes to you that is in compliance with the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8214)|
| 2:16:59| then you are pretty much obligated to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8219)|
| 2:17:02| In this instance, they're asking for a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8222)|
| 2:17:04| which indicates, which is evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| that it doesn't comply with the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| So you have the authority in this instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| because they've asked for a variance, to deny the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| and then in hand that you could deny the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8234)|
| 2:17:19| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| Yeah, I just hope that before we vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8243)|
| 2:17:27| that we realize the lot sizes are 36 by 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8247)|
| 2:17:33| And when you put a house on that, I mean, 36 by 50 is right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8253)|
| 2:17:40| We're looking at it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| I think as Mr. Reynolds said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| there is no minimum lot size in the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8267)|
| 2:17:51| and whether that was a wise thing or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| is something we're not asked to opine on at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8274)|
| 2:18:01| There is a requirement for a 30% coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| and that will be the challenge for the architect and developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8284)|
| 2:18:07| on a basically 1,500 square foot lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| 30% is 500 square feet, or less than 500 square feet of coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8290)|
| 2:18:20| and that's a pretty small footprint for a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8300)|
| 2:18:24| That's their challenge is that the developers and architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8304)|
| 2:18:27| if the plat is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| Commissioner Eason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| Oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Graf, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| Well, yeah, but we don't have to approve it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8315)|
| 2:18:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8319)|
| 2:18:40| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| Commissioner Eason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| I like the idea of small cottages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| I think there's probably a good demand for small cottages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| But I have a question for staff about the South Waterfront SW1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8329)|
| 2:18:54| How many dwelling units per acre are allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8334)|
| 2:18:58| or is that not applicable on SW1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8338)|
| 2:19:04| I don't think there is no density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| Again, it's an interesting code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8347)|
| 2:19:15| Just for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| the reason we brought this in front of the board for a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| was primarily because the 25-foot turning radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| is kind of contrary to city planning standards in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8363)|
| 2:19:29| and I think that's why engineering approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| We don't have a problem dividing this into four with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| It's just a matter of the city would never use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| and it didn't really make much sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| Like, basically, us to give a turning radius back to the city to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8380)|
| 2:19:45| when the city's not going to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| We're going to put in sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8387)|
| 2:19:48| We're going to develop this whole parcel into an urban parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8388)|
| 2:19:52| So, again, we didn't apply for it because we didn't meet the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8392)|
| 2:19:58| We applied for it because we thought the 25-foot turning radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| didn't make any sense, quite frankly, in this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| whether that matters to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| So, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8406)|
| 2:20:07| you don't need the variance to go forward with your plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| Well, so we basically, if you see the top left of that parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8410)|
| 2:20:15| it would take a turning radius of 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| So definitely a building on 7R1 gets a lot more creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8417)|
| 2:20:22| if that turning radius is 25 feet, but it's still possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8422)|
| 2:20:28| And so, again, the idea was we're not breaking any rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8428)|
| 2:20:31| We're still adhering to the SW1 guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| And you're also planning to put sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8435)|
| 2:20:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8438)|
| 2:20:41| This doesn't affect the actual roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| It's just the dedication of right of way at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| So the roadway radius is not going to change, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8447)|
| 2:20:54| I'm pining on the appropriateness of various standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8454)|
| 2:20:59| Having suburban standards in an urban area is challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8459)|
| 2:21:04| and, you know, 25-foot turning radius at street intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8464)|
| 2:21:08| is a very suburban standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| So that's something that maybe engineering could look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8470)|
| 2:21:14| and give Curtis a bit more to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8474)|
| 2:21:18| to look at urban standards for streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8478)|
| 2:21:22| We have received requests to revise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| and revisit the South Waterfront Code and some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8487)|
| 2:21:32| I think this area has brought up some very legitimate concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8492)|
| 2:21:37| Those are things that should be looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8497)|
| 2:21:40| in a revisit of the South Waterfront Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8500)|
| 2:21:45| We do have a motion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| This is good discussion and I think some education, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8507)|
| 2:21:51| as far as some of the form-based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| that was put in place for the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| I didn't realize some of the things that I heard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8517)|
| 2:22:03| So we do have a motion by Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8523)|
| 2:22:07| I believe it was a second by Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8527)|
| 2:22:09| to approve the variance on this final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8529)|
| 2:22:15| I see no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8539)|
| 2:22:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8542)|
| 2:22:24| We have one opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| Thank you. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8546)|
| 2:22:29| Just as a quick follow-up to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| you notice you only had one final plat on your agenda this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8551)|
| 2:22:36| That's because with staff approval of final plats now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| the only time you'll see a final plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| is when there is a variance request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8561)|
| 2:22:44| I wonder if we might consider moving this up in the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8564)|
| 2:22:48| as they used to be, I think, second or third,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8568)|
| 2:22:51| maybe consider moving this up because it seems like this is almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| they're very rarely commented on, but when they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8575)|
| 2:23:00| someone has said to sit through a very long meeting sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| If we move something else, move this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| and put something else at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8586)|
| 2:23:08| somebody else will have to sit through the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8588)|
| 2:23:11| I understand, but typically there's not as much comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| on the final plats as some of the other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| Madam Chair, I have a quick comment about something today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| Gerald, you'll probably be able to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| Number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8606)|
| 2:23:28| Number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| It was on consent originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8610)|
| 2:23:33| and the person that made the submittal took it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8613)|
| 2:23:39| My question is how did it end up on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| when what he actually requested, we changed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| We changed what he actually asked for and then put it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| Because we did not hear from him before with regard to whether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| and we send those recommendations to the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8634)|
| 2:23:59| and when we don't hear from them, better or worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8639)|
| 2:24:04| we take that as a sign of agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| Mr. Mundy likes talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8648)|
| 2:24:13| and he has talked to staff quite a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8653)|
| 2:24:17| and he saw this as an opportunity for a different audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8657)|
| 2:24:20| to review his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8660)|
| 2:24:24| I was just curious because obviously it was controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| because he was here and we argued about it for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| Unless we hear from the applicant and we think they agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8670)|
| 2:24:34| but we do provide that opportunity for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8674)|
| 2:24:36| and let them know that they don't want it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| I was going to make a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| Can you pull down your microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| That was a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8686)|
| 2:24:48| Let's hear your joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8688)|
| 2:24:49| On those small lots we'll have Dwarf, Nandina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| and also Dwarf Junipers to have evergreens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8691)|
| 2:24:55| We'll make a motion that we dwarf this meeting into adjournment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8695)|
| 2:25:02| We have one more agenda item, and we have a big, adoring audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8702)|
| 2:25:09| but I am going to turn this over to our election committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| As you all know, during the November meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| the nominating committee recommended that Commissioner Toker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8718)|
| 2:25:22| be elected chair for calendar year 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8722)|
| 2:25:26| In addition to Commissioner, Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8726)|
| 2:25:30| was nominated from the floor for office of chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8730)|
| 2:25:38| He had told me earlier that he wanted his name removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| so I'm just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| Thank you, Dick, for nominating me, seconded by Commissioner Hale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| I respectfully decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8747)|
| 2:25:50| Janice has done an admirable job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8750)|
| 2:25:52| and I think at least another year would be appropriate for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8752)|
| 2:25:57| Thank you, but I will decline at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| The records show that Commissioner Phillips would like his name removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8764)|
| 2:26:07| from the list of candidates for chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8767)|
| 2:26:10| Now I will also entertain any additional nominees from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8770)|
| 2:26:19| Do I have a motion that nomination cease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| Motion that nomination cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8783)|
| 2:26:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8784)|
| 2:26:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8785)|
| 2:26:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8786)|
| 2:26:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| Without objection, the vote will be taken by a show of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| So all in favor of Commissioner Toker for chair for calendar year 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8795)|
| 2:26:40| please raise your hand and keep it up, and please don't vote twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8800)|
| 2:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8809)|
| 2:26:50| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| Congratulations, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| So moving on to Vice Chair, during the November meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8814)|

| 2:27:01| Vice Chair for calendar year 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191212?start=8821)|
