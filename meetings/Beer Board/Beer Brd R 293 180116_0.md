| 0:00:59| And I appreciate you all coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| No doubt, maybe Mr. Stair is having a baby tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| Who knows? Maybe that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| I would like to correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| He can never have a baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| Sorry for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| They closed the Market Street Federal Courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=74)|
| 0:01:17| It's duly noted that you were late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=77)|
| 0:01:19| That's all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| No, I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| Anyway, we've got an agenda in front of us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| Do I have a motion to approve the minutes from the last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| Motion is second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Any opposed say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Okay, so we have a few things on the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| When I call your name and the business applying for the permit, come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| Speak into the microphone and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| Applicants who are approved pending final documentation need to bring the completed documentation to the business tax office during regular business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=104)|
| 0:01:53| Applicants who have their permit approved tonight can pick up their permit at the end of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| And beer board members, if any application is deferred, please pass your package to Mrs. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| We'll use it again next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| So the first one up is Khalid Ameed, applicant, First Stop Discount Tobacco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=126)|
| 0:02:23| I'm the one that applied for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| Khalid Ameed is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| My address is 124 East Springdale Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Mr. Cower, Sergeant Cower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| However, owner Ameed admitted to one of my officers that he did not fill out the application himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=157)|
| 0:02:46| nor did he get it notarized that his brother filled it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| Also, he answered yes to question number eight, where he had a beer permit in New York City suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=172)|
| 0:03:03| Mr. Frost, what are our options with that tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| One option would be to allow the owner to re-complete or re-fill out the paperwork himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=188)|
| 0:03:20| and have it properly notarized, give them the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=200)|
| 0:03:28| So it can be denied or it can be postponed for a new application to be filled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| Is that our two options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Do you have a comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| Well, his brother has power of attorney over him, I guess, for, like, some of the business decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| So that's why we had the paper notarized while we were here because he lives in New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| So instead of him coming down here to just have one paper notarized, it was a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| because I actually had the paper notarized under my name and turned it in, but it was the wrong paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| So we then took it to the notary public, and where his brother has legal statements of power of attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| we had the paper notarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Sergeant Coward, were you provided a copy of that power of attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| No, I was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| I mean, because we just took care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| I mean, I can bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| I mean, I can get a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| Or we can postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| So in light of this, can we make a motion to postpone until we get the proper documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| to support the power of attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| I would suggest, if it's going to be postponed, that the owner actually fill out the paperwork himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=275)|
| 0:04:43| He sign it and have it notarized and not have a power of attorney that might be from another state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=283)|
| 0:04:55| Be direct would be my suggestion, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| If that is the motion, I will second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| So postpone it for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| Would 30 days be enough time for you guys to complete new paperwork or have him come and fill it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=307)|
| 0:05:16| Yes, that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Which paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Was it just the one affidavit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| Is it the one I most recently turned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| I'm not really sure which one it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| The beer permit application itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| Just the whole application again just to make sure everything is correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| He needs to fill it out and have it notarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| And it doesn't have to be notarized in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| You can send it to him in New York and he can have it notarized there, but he needs the original back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Yes, that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Question, Mr. Stare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| So what is, I'm sorry, what's going on with his affidavit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| This is not his signature and it was notarized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| Is that what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Yes, that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=358)|
| 0:06:05| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| Do we know what the suspended permit was for in New York?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| He said that he operated, I believe, a grocery store in New York| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| and an employee of his received three tickets and the permit was suspended there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=381)|
| 0:06:33| So you have an option to postpone it, is what you proposed, or deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| The difference is that on a denial, then they start all over with the fees and the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| In this case, what you're giving him is an opportunity to resubmit the paperwork signed and notarized by the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=406)|
| 0:06:55| without having to repay the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| That's essentially what's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| Your motion is to postpone it and give them time to resubmit the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| When he received the three citations, he was actually here opening this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| when the employee received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| And what he did, he was given the option to pay a $1,000 fine and then wait seven months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| but instead he just paid the fine and forfeited his beer permit up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| So he doesn't even have beer in the store up there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| But he has an obligation on the application to disclose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| I was just letting you know on that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| He just had an obligation to disclose that on the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| So there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| Did we get a second on that to postpone it for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| You all agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| So all those in favor of postponing this for 30 days say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| So it's postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| You'll need to get a new application from this day and then send it out and have it notarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| Do I get it today or do I need to get it downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| Get it online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| You'll have to come during regular business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| During regular business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| What's the date for the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| It's the 27th of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| It's the 27th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| How appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| It's about time, Tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| It seemed appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=490)|

| 0:15:52| That's what we said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Our options are to continue to extend it and postpone it or let it die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| So that's kind of your options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| So, yes, Ms. Rauner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| So, sir, you said your contractors or you're waiting on your contractors to do the work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| Well, our contractors all lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| They're lined up to do the work or they did it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| To do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| But we've had just small issues with, like, getting our permit to do the work with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| They wanted me to go ahead and get, like, an architect and an engineer to draw up, like, our parking lot and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| Right, submit plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Yeah, and we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| And with our engineer, it took, like, two months for everything to even get submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| And now it's taken each time that we've submitted this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| approved part of it or failed part of it, it's taken a month between each one of those steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| So it's just taken a lot longer than it really should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| So if we let it die, it starts all over again in terms of the costs of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Where are you in the process right now, and how long do you anticipate before you would be complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| Well, we thought we would be by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| I mean, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| What do you feel is realistic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| I know it's hard to ask for another 90 days, but I really would like to have it done, and I'll have to come back in here for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| How many things are left to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| You've got building inspections, fire, and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| You don't have your health department approvals yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Because they can't come in until we get, I reckon, all of our taps and stuff like that set up for him to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1053)|
| 0:17:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| So you haven't done your finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| That's basically where we're at is our parking lot and just the finishing stuff on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| So you're, I'm guessing, in the dark here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| I mean, you're past studs, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| You've got walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| What really caused this to take longer is we're turning a really old house, residential, into non-ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1077)|
| 0:18:05| So we had to go through quite a bit of work to get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| And now that it's being turned to commercial from where it was at is why we're having to go to these extra steps with the engineer and the architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1091)|
| 0:18:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| But you've got all your zoning cleared, all those hurdles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| So you feel it's 90 days, not 30, not 60, but 90?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| Probably so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| So I'll make a motion to extend for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1118)|
| 0:18:47| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| Of course, if they get this done, they can pick up their permit at any time if they get it done before 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| He doesn't have to come back if he's done and gets all his reports and he gets in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1136)|
| 0:19:04| I've got a motion to extend it 90 days and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| Extended for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| I hope you get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Yeah, me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| I'm sure you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Thanks for coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1165)|

| 0:19:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| Subject to final documentation on September 26th meeting, registered mail was sent December 6th, returned unclaimed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| no one appeared at the December 19th meeting, and we gave you a 30-day extension in your absence to today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1193)|
| 0:20:01| Where are you now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| I still need another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| We're still not done with construction quite yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| I love Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| And Ryder, it's in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Whoever I am, woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| Thinking Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| I wish you were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| I was focused on the other one at the moment, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| So you're thinking you need another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| Where are you in the process specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| We're almost about done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| We just need a bunch of inspections and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| And you feel confident that 30 days is going to make it happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| Are you sure you don't need 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| I'll take 60, just to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| I mean, do you want to do this again in 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| 60 is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| 60 sounds a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| I'll make a motion that we postpone for 60 days pending completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| I'll make a motion to postpone it for 60 days and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| Extend for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Sir, I would say that if we do send you a registered mail, that you return it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| That's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| It's important to show up for these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| If you're not done and this will be back on our agenda in 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| you can't be assured that it's always going to get extended in your absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| That's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| I'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| You need to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Hopefully we'll get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| In 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Next up, Geysers Brewing, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| I have it drawn there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| It's been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| It's been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| I like the name and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| I think they plan to refile later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| It was extending for so long that they felt like they needed to let it die| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| and they will refile closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| Is that the last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Are they withdrawing both of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| Just the manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| They picked up the manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| They withdraw the ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| So they've been released for the manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| They've been released for the manufacturing, so they're good there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| They just haven't figured out the serving yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| They don't have their building ready for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| Sorry, I wasn't clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180116?start=1363)|
