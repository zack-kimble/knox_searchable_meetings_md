| 0:05:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| Thank you for having me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| My name is Erin Downey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| I live at 6918 Westerly Winds, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| The reason that I'm here is twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| I want to first introduce myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| I am the Regional Director for Rural Metro in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| I came in as an addition to the current team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| As you know, Chief Harnish was standing in my role for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| and with the changing health care world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| we needed a critical focus on the solutions that we're going to provide to the pre-hospital health care environment here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=362)|
| 0:06:11| So a little bit about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| I believe my role as the Regional Director with Rural Metro is to serve the people that actually do the real work out in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=374)|
| 0:06:22| I have 22 years of pre-hospital health care experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| and with a keen focus on public-private partnerships and identifying the specific needs of each community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=385)|
| 0:06:36| In 2012, after several visits to Knoxville, I fell in love with the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| and so I moved up here to make Knoxville my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| I obtained my MBA from the University of Tennessee last year to infuse a little orange in my blood because I did come from Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=406)|
| 0:06:55| I wanted to tell you a little bit about the 2014 accomplishments that we have made at Rural Metro in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=415)|
| 0:07:02| We've invested about $3.5 million into new technology and new software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| It's part of the new CAD that we're working on getting up and running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| as well as two unique pieces of software that will help us manage our system better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| We put into place 60 new ambulances in Knox County in 2014, with an additional nine ambulances scheduled for 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=436)|
| 0:07:27| We have a total fleet in East Tennessee to support all disaster responses or operations of 90 ambulances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=447)|
| 0:07:36| One of the things I wanted to speak directly to is our financial strength, some of the things that we've done as a company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| Although we're very strong in Knox County, we also have a large national presence behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| We have recently done some things to ensure a strong financial future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| We have outsourced our billing functions, renegotiated several contracts with key entities across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=472)|
| 0:08:01| and we have worked to renegotiate favorable agreements with critical suppliers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=481)|
| 0:08:09| Our response time performance has met standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| Knox County sets a 90% at 10 minute standard across the county, which we have met month over month, year over year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=492)|
| 0:08:21| We also have an administrative office in West Knox where we allow Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| State of Tennessee Health Department, as well as many others to utilize that location for meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| It's a large training facility, and we're happy to give back to Knox County in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| In addition, we do provide several opportunities for training, not just internally or for other allied agencies in the EMS and fire divisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=520)|
| 0:08:53| but we offer CPR as well as advanced cardiac life support training and pediatric life support training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| as well as many other trainings at our office that we publish across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| I'm happy to answer any questions if you have any questions of me at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| You gave a number of new ambulances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| Is that an increase in vehicle number or replacement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| The 16 ambulances, we're replacing ambulances that were currently in our fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| The fleet remains the same size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| That's correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| All right, thank you, Ms. Downey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| Next on the list is Tracy Clough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| I hope I'm pronouncing that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Clough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| Sir, if we can get your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| If I mispronounce your name, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Yes, my name is Tracy Allen Clough, and I live at 457 Tammy Drive, Apartment 9, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=603)|
| 0:10:15| And I'd like to talk to you here for a few minutes today about intergovernmental state-sponsored terrorism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=615)|
| 0:10:24| that includes kidnapping, piracy, antitrust, and public mistrust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| as well as state-sponsored star chamber courts operating in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| In 1998, I was a victim of a frame and setup in the General Sessions Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| in which a private attorney I'd sued two years earlier had friends in the DA's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| and when I came to my preliminary, they manufactured and tampered with evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| and placed me in jail with an unreasonable bond of $100,000 in which the only way I could get out was to plead guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=654)|
| 0:11:03| When I got out, I went about to sue them, and I took the judge to the court of judiciary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=663)|
| 0:11:10| and she lied nearly 30 times, and when I ordered the tapes, I received 23 deleted court tapes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=670)|
| 0:11:20| to prove that she had made these inconsistent statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| When I went to file charges in the DA's office for tampering with evidence, upon exiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=685)|
| 0:11:34| they wouldn't give me a police report in the city because they said the DA and judges were their bosses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| So when I came out, I had a can of mace on me, and he asked me for ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=701)|
| 0:11:49| I told the lady, well, if they won't give me a report and the DA won't meet with me without a report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| then I'll just execute a citizen's arrest under Title 40, which I'm entitled to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| She pushed the panic button, and four Knox County officers came out and asked me for my ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=722)|
| 0:12:10| and as I was going through my pockets like you do in the court search back then, they noticed the can of mace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| They grabbed me in a headlock, threw me to the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| My tapes went up in the air, my briefcase went up in the air, and they charged me with four assaults on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=741)|
| 0:12:28| which derailed a $2,070,000 lawsuit against a private attorney as well as these tapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=748)|
| 0:12:36| I filed a grievance on the bond of the court clerk who had the care, custody, and control of the tapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=756)|
| 0:12:46| and Knox County is not transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| The county law director covered it up, and the Hartford Insurance Company covered it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=771)|
| 0:12:58| and I'm here to tell the commission today that under the Constitution, when rights, liberty, and property is taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=778)|
| 0:13:06| without due process of law, just compensation will be paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| and I'm here to receive the payment of that just compensation, $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| and I will give the committee five minutes to decide if they're going to negotiate with me on these terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=797)|
| 0:13:24| or if we will begin Operation Turn Back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| We don't have the ability to negotiate that issue with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| I would recommend you call the state attorney general's office if you can't get justice in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| As you see, what happened last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| Well, sir, I mean, we can't negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| When I went to the DA's office, I got beat up and four charges put against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| I had to defend myself on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| So it's sort of like the fox watching the hen house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Well, if you can go to the state attorney general's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| I'm holding the entire state of Tennessee responsible, the entire state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| and all properties involved commensurate to my damages of $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Good day, and thanks for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Next on the list is Xavier Presley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| Mr. Presley, your name, address, and phone number, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| Yes, my name is Xavier Presley, 1134 Glade Hill Drive, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| I'm here to complain about the school board again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| I see you people don't take it serious enough to look into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| so I'm going to just keep coming back using the five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| I wrote to the Department of Education, to the secretary in Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| I'm going to write him every week until I get some answers of why the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| won't at least address our issues as parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| My concern is West Hills Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| They put cones in front of our vehicles in the back of the school where we drop our kids off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| where we can't go in and pick our kids up at 245.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| All we want to do is get our kids and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| We don't have no interest in being in the school no considerable amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| And then I went two weeks ago on Tuesday when I found out the meeting was today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| to answer to the speech therapist about my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| She left a voice message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| I called her, and after I called, I left her a message saying to come to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| that we need to have a meeting about my daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| I went to the school that Tuesday, and I asked for Ms. Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| They said she wasn't in that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Then I asked to speak to the teacher in fifth grade, and I went down to the teacher room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| and the staff left the office unattended and followed me around like I'm a criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| There's nothing I want to steal from that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| I've been helping kids for over 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| If they want to debate about it, I went to the school that Oprah and Denzel made a movie about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| called The Great Debater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| That's a real story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| So I'm here to just let you know that I don't want nothing from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| I don't just want nothing from West Hills Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| I just want to just have a decent finish the year out and get my daughter out of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| I mean, it's sad that this principal is using her little power to intimidate the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=986)|
| 0:16:33| and trying to intimidate the parents, but it's not working with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| I don't have enough problems with this school board, and I told Dr. McIntyre, I wrote him a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| I wrote Mr. Duncan, the secretary of DC, and I'm going to continue to write him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| If it takes embarrassing them to see that we are serious about some of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| you've got so many parents at West Hills Elementary who refuse to even go up to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| to have a parent-teacher conference because the staff there is just unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| If you people don't see that, at least go there and see what some of us parents are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| We're not asking for nothing special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| And for them to follow me around like I'm a criminal in the school, that's not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| And I'm waiting on that next school board hearing to let them know just how I feel about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| Is there anybody else that would like to speak at public forum that did not sign up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1049)|
| 0:17:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| We will take just a few minutes break, and then we'll be back to conclude the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1057)|
| 0:17:48| As you guys are aware, what we'll do is we'll go ahead and kind of start at the beginning as a normal meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| and then we'll have to make a motion to suspend the rules here in just a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| to put away the meeting that we missed due to the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| So we'll go ahead and call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1085)|

| 0:18:20| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Nine members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Today's devotional is to Commissioner Sam McKenzie, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1103)|

| 0:20:44| And for the commission meeting January the 26th, motion for the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| I want to make a motion to suspend the rules that provide for commission work session on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| the Monday prior to the regularly scheduled meeting to establish a consent calendar to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| conduct commission business at this, the regularly scheduled meeting of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| I make this motion because the regularly scheduled work session was canceled this past Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| due to inclement weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| We have a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| I think the meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| It was Tuesday due to the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Or due to the holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| I'll change that in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| This requires eight affirmative votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| So it's a suspension of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| And what this will allow us to do is to do away with that work session and operate off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| this current agenda into this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Why don't we do a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1304)|

| 0:22:29| We will suspend the minutes on that meeting and we'll go into the commission meeting as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| regularly scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| I sent out a consent agenda and I think the numbers on your current printout, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1355)|
| 0:22:43| no numbers on the printout except for page numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| So on page one, resolution 101 will be deferred until next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1367)|
| 0:22:56| Page two, 110, or resolution 110 will be delayed until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1376)|
| 0:23:05| The next item not on consent will be on page five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| 208, which is from the public library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1391)|

| 0:23:34| Next item is 801 not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| It's on page eight, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| And then same on 802 on page eight is not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| It's deferred but we wanted to have a discussion about it so we're going to have a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| And the next item not on consent will be on page 10, item 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1433)|
| 0:24:03| And if it's on the agenda, if it says withdrawn at the request of sponsor, it is withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| at the request of sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| So that sets the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Pending a vote, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| Yes, I'd like to add an item to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1455)|

| 0:24:31| Ceremony Fund that will be coming here end of April, first of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1471)|

| 0:31:22| A quick question from Chris Caldwell regarding 803, which is on the unclaimed balance of accounts to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1882)|
| 0:31:40| Do you have any idea about what that figure is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Chris, can you come down from the unclaimed balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1903)|
| 0:31:53| I meant to ask you that at lunch, Chris, and I forgot it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| Do you want to know what the balance or the possible on the unclaimed is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| We really won't know until we get it back to the state. What we're doing here is the state, by statute, says every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1921)|
| 0:32:08| you've got to pass this resolution and then we will file our unclaimed property in May and then we will receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1928)|
| 0:32:17| not to get too technical, but what we file in May will be unclaimed property for the calendar year of 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1937)|
| 0:32:26| and then we'll be receiving back the amount for 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| Last year the amount was $150,000 or so and the year before it was a little more than that, it was $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| It's going to depend on what, because the amount that we turn in is just a piece, but what comes back to us is anything that is involving Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1959)|
| 0:32:48| And so it's usually around, it's going to vary, but anywhere between $50,000 and $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1968)|
| 0:32:56| It just depends, and we budget for that, but when we budget for it, it's always small because we don't want to over budget and not receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1976)|
| 0:33:04| So to give you an amount would be hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=1984)|

| 0:33:32| I just wanted to bring out, is anybody here from the libraries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| I didn't ask them to come and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2015)|

| 0:33:38| Could you come down, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2018)|
| 0:33:56| I really just wanted to recognize the work that the Foundation does for the library through some of their fundraising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| and if you want to talk about that for just a few minutes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| I'm Rita Black, 500 West Church Avenue, library director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| The Library Foundation does a fabulous job in assisting us with various programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| and of course the Saturday Stories and Songs is one that we began five years or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| and we have excellent attendance with Cedar Bluff easily being the location that consistently has the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| Sometimes we have 75 present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| Others are less, but it is well attended throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| and we are delighted that the Foundation is supporting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| and has supported that solidly from the Margaret Dixon Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| or the Margaret Dixon deposit in the Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| And as you know, she was the library children's director at the Lawson McGee Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| so it's fitting that we support children's services across the county with proceeds from those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| The Foundation is terrific, and they will be supporting another initiative that is in the quiet phase at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2097)|
| 0:35:05| but you'll be hearing a lot about that really soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| so we're delighted that they support the children's services with the Saturday Stories and Songs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| We have story times, as you know, throughout the week at most locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| but Saturdays seem to be a day that some individuals have time away from work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| and other obligations that they can attend that they might not be able to attend during the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| So we're delighted to be able to present those on Saturdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| Well, thank you for what you do, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2134)|

| 0:37:05| Hopefully he will be here in a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| And to give him a little bit more time, is there a way that we could move this to the heel of the agenda today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2231)|
| 0:37:19| We can, but that heel may not be too far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| Well, I don't mind, too, because I have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| I'll be glad to try to address them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| I mean, I'm as familiar with it, I think, as a person can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| We have gone through, you know, a lot of revisions to the marina lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| The marina lease has passed through a number of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| It has gone through Chief Rubel of the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| It has gone through Bud Armstrong, the law director, and his staff, and Daniel Sanders and David Boock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| The lease has gone through a number of changes, and it has been written and agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| And what you have before you is a negotiated lease, which I think protects the county in a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2283)|
| 0:38:12| I know this is a long-term lease, being a ten-year lease, and that may cause a lot of you pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2292)|
| 0:38:19| It may cause some heartburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| But the thing about this lease is that it may be ten years, but there is an out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| If the marina changes hands within the next ten years, the county is put on notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2309)|
| 0:38:37| and the county may, at its option, terminate the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| The county would then receive the marina fees that it has paid up to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2322)|
| 0:38:50| or from that point forward would be reimbursed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| So I think that the best way to look at it from a legal standpoint is it is a month-to-month, ten-year lease, month-to-month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2335)|
| 0:39:10| The county has an out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| If the marina changes hands, we don't want the county doing business with somebody it doesn't want to do business with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2353)|
| 0:39:21| So from that standpoint, it is a negotiated price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| The price is $700 per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| If you're not familiar with the slip at Volunteer Landing, this is a new dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| It is a dock that has just been moved into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| It is brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| It is right at the entrance where you walk to the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| It is the most convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| The lease that would have priority one attached to it on the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| It is right here downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| You can literally walk from your car and walk right to your boat, and you're on the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| That plays into the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| This is a slip that would lease for $1,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| It is the prime boat slip, as I say, downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2411)|
| 0:40:18| We want to make that available to the Knox County Sheriff's Department for its use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| We also want to make one available to the city for their use, if they so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| But the sheriff has a boat and certainly has an operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| and they can certainly use it for whatever effort, whether it's patrol or whether it's for recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| or whether it is to save someone's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| John, I don't know if you're the one to answer questions or not, but, yeah, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| as a general statement, I'm not, this may sound crass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| but I'm not really concerned about whether the city or the county person has a prime boat slip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| I mean, to me, it's more about logistics and rationale behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| I don't, I mean, if it's on Front Street, that's not of concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| So let me ask, kind of do a compare and contrast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| So we have a boat slip currently, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| What, and sheriff's folks may want to chime in on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| what makes this one better from a response standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| from an emergency preparedness and ability to get from point A to point B in terms of, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2497)|
| 0:41:48| Clearly in terms of location, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| So the one we have now, is it kind of tucked away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Is it, I'm trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| It's all the way down at the end of the dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| Okay, so just to get to the boat is the biggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| It is the, which plays into response times, which plays into really a life safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2524)|
| 0:42:12| What we have now, what the sheriff's department currently leases, is a boat at the very end of the dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2532)|
| 0:42:20| I believe, I'm not misstating this, I believe it's the least expensive slip that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2540)|
| 0:42:29| I think it's been stated it's a quarter of a mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| I have provided you with a diagram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| It should have been in color, but that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| Was that in that letter from yesterday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| And the exhibit that's attached to that letter contains a, do you have that in front of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| I've got extra copies I'll be glad to provide you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| I read it, I just didn't see the drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| Yeah, I don't have it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| It is a diagram, a color photo of the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| It showed up in my email black and white and kind of grainy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| But I do understand there were slips A through G and H has been brought in and is beside A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2586)|
| 0:43:16| So I understand the logistical part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| This would be the only slip on the west side of the store, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2610)|
| 0:43:37| According to the way I saw the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| The only kind of group slips you mean, like that new part that they brought in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| Yeah, the new part that has multiple slips in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2628)|
| 0:43:56| And, John, how much are we paying now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| Right now it is, for the slip, it's 165, which is a reduced rate from 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2640)|
| 0:44:16| The boat slip also contains a lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| So the boat is able to be suspended out of the water when it's not in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| And the current one does not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| The current one does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| It is, I believe that lift is leased from an outside agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| The marina does not provide a lift, does not provide maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| That would, it certainly, this is able to be installed at this, on this boat slip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2684)|
| 0:44:52| In addition to that, you're able to construct a storage bin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| a storage compartment on the lift itself to store your gear while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| so you don't have to carry it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| I was wondering how many emergency responses have originated from that dock location last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| That I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| Thanks, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| I hope the Sheriff wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| It's, I think the question is, it's not really about emergency responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| It's about all the functions that happen downtown that we participate in, ballgames, Boomsday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2736)|
| 0:45:43| any of those type of events we have a boat at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| So those are the events that we respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| To say that they're emergencies, they're not, but they could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| So that's why we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| Mr. Owen, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| In your presentation, you talked about two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| You talked about month to month and a 10-year lease, and you said we can get out of it at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| You can get out of it at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| My question to you is, why in the world would we pay $85,000 up front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| Because it's a reduced rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| And the reason that we can provide the reduced rate is because we can put it on the 10-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| Otherwise, it's $1,000 a month for this slip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| I mean, it's a substantial savings if you looked at it over 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| If you lease it out at $1,000 a month, it's $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2795)|
| 0:46:44| The amount seems to be a problem to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| There must be a reason that it's $84,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| Is there some other reason why they need $84,000 up front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| Well, it was a negotiated lease amount negotiated between us and the Knox County Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| It is a reduced fee for the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| Well, why isn't it five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| Why isn't it four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| The negotiation was for 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| And that started out at 10 and stayed at 10, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| It's been at 10, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| We haven't discussed five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| If we needed to discuss five, you know, if Mr. Kiger were here, he could certainly respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2840)|
| 0:47:28| But it's based on a 10-year lease, and that's savings to the county, as well as it locks it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| It locks the price in for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| And I'm not a builder, and I'm certainly not a watercraft user that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| We could build a pretty good boathouse out here behind the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| That seems kind of expensive for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| But thank you for answering my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| It is a long-term lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| How many of those other boat docks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| And this is Section H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| This is H, and it's been moved to the very walk-up portion of the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| How many of those are currently available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| That I don't know, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| How many of the other slips are available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| That Mr. Kiger would have to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| So H is actually in front of the gate that provides some security, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| H is at the closest proximity to the boathouse that is there now, which is the entrance to the dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2916)|
| 0:48:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| So there's like a tow that you get pushed in and get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| So there's a modicum of security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Of course, you can get to it from the water, but at least from walk-up traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| that's something that those other slips are provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| Commissioner, or Mr. Owens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| My question is what happens if there's a bankruptcy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| Then the lease terminates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| All of those provisions have been written into the new lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| If there's a bankruptcy, the county has an out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| But the trustee of the bankruptcy would determine if we got our money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| So there is no out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| Well, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| There's protection if the court grants protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| It would be like any other situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| I'm going to move to table this, and just in case Mr. Cogger comes into the meeting before we get done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| is that okay with everybody that we table it until the end of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| That way, if Mr. Cogger is here, there's some questions that he might want to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| You're saying without objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Yeah, if there's no objection to tabling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| We're going to table it until the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| Without objection, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| Resolution 701 is accepting donations in the total amount of $3,631.12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3009)|
| 0:50:17| and eight barrels of food collected from visitors at Knox County's Holiday Festival of Lights at Concord Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| and approving the donation of saying to the Love Kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| Doug, do you mind to come down and talk about that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| Again, this is one of those items that would normally be on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| but I think it's appropriate for Doug to kind of praise some of his employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| So, Doug, if you want to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| Doug Battelle, 2447 Sutherland Avenue, Director of Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| Chairman, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| Again, appreciate the recognizing staff employees here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| We have a great team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| We're proud of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| They do a great job all across county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| They really enjoy putting on this Holiday Festival of Lights every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| It's kind of a labor of love, and it goes to Love Kitchen, so that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| I also want to mention about a week ago we unfortunately lost a great leader in the park system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| Troy Wilson, who was our superintendent at Concord Park for about 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| and the improvements at Concord Park were a great credit to him and the pride he took in his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| So we're going to miss him and just want to pass that along to his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| Doug, you know, I appreciate all that your folks are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| and also I appreciate all the citizens that actually, you know, made this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3091)|
| 0:51:38| But, you know, I never miss an opportunity to brag on those two lovely ladies at the Love Kitchen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3098)|
| 0:51:46| and for you all to choose them is a really good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| We in the First District really appreciate you all choosing Helen and Ellen's ministry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| and that really is what it is, their ministry to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| So much luck in the future going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| I think we just enjoy taking it over to the ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| The huds are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| Thank you, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| Next item is Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| It's approving a contract for an investment-grade energy audit with Trane U.S. Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| in an amount not to exceed $226,110 for Knox County government facilities, Phase 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| Contract amount is only directed payable to Trane in the event Knox County determines not to proceed with improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3156)|
| 0:52:44| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| Commissioner Rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| As read from the caption, contract amount is only directly payable to Trane in the event Knox County determines not to proceed with improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3172)|
| 0:53:03| I wanted to clarify that a little bit by reading on the rest of that sentence that's in the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| and if Knox County determines to proceed with an energy savings performance contract with Trane for Phase 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3188)|
| 0:53:16| the amount will be incorporated in the project cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| And still yet having read that, it does not cover the fact that I think, and I want to make sure of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3199)|
| 0:53:26| if energy savings can be found, the savings will cover the cost of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3206)|
| 0:53:34| and I'm calling on Purchasing to address that to make sure that I'm in the right thought with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| Hugh Holt, Knox County Purchasing Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| The cost of the investment grade audit will be a part of the overall project cost if we decide to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3224)|
| 0:53:51| Basically what we're paying for is engineering and design services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Hugh, does this also include the units we have under PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| Some, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Specifically my swimming pool audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| I can't keep them little ladies warm out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| Electric blankets maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| The water, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Did you get your question answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| Yeah, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3272)|
| 0:54:38| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| Resolution 802 is approving the method of disposition, public auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3281)|
| 0:54:47| or negotiated sale for delinquent tax surplus properties owned by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| Approving the sale of the properties for less than taxes owed pursuant to Tennessee Code annotated subsection 67-5-2507| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3292)|
| 0:55:01| and fixing the offering price of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| Well, this was already deferred, but Commissioner Rott wanted to have a discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| This motion is to defer until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| The reason I wanted to discuss it is because there is an attachment to this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| which has those pieces of property in Knox County that have been offered for sale at the owed tax cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3321)|
| 0:55:32| and the county received no bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| These pieces of property now can be sold by auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| That's the part I want us to take attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| It can be disposed of by public auction or a negotiated sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| We need to look at the attachment, make sure we understand that for the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| and I believe the Insolvency Board will meet sometime between now and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| to bring forward this kind of motion to make sure that we act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3359)|
| 0:56:09| The delinquent tax sales are conducted by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| These surplus properties, though, I need to have this clear for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| I believe are performed by a contract auction company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| Would that be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| Mr. Holt, I'm sorry I've left you in the dark on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| The sale of surplus properties that is in this Resolution 802, this deferred until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3393)|
| 0:56:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| Talks of sales by public auction or negotiated sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| These sales are contracted, right, not performed by the trustee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| The non-negotiated sales are done through PAL auction company, and they're sold on a Web site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3414)|
| 0:57:04| Does PAL handle both of these type sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| No, we handle the negotiated sales because we determine if it falls in the negotiated sale bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3427)|
| 0:57:14| The contractor does not make that determination for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| So the addendum or the listing of these properties, that's being suggested to us, right, in a certain column on that attachment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3439)|
| 0:57:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| Will it be auctioned by PAL or negotiated by Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| And these pieces of property, if they came from a previous tax sale 12 months ago, these are pieces of property without redemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3455)|
| 0:57:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| So people need to be looking at this for the next month to make sure there's not a good deal for adjacent property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3468)|
| 0:57:56| or investment grade properties to enrich Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| That commercial is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| On behalf of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| Is there any other discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| We don't have to take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| It's already deferred in the consent, but we'll make sure that you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Resolution 904 is number one, authorizing the hiring of a lobbyist to keep the Knox County Commission apprised of proposed legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3499)|
| 0:58:29| which would affect Knox County and to lobby on behalf of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| and number two, requesting the Knox County Purchasing Division to issue a request for proposals for lobbying services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| and to submit the most responsive proposal to the commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| I make a motion that we defer it until next month, hoping Commissioner Burroughs will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3527)|
| 0:58:58| Mr. Chairman, last meeting we said we're going to decide this once and for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| The only reason I think that we should decide it is because it's a resolution that is a discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3544)|
| 0:59:12| where we can add it into the budget and negotiate it into the budget if we want to move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| But I would like for Hugh to have a discussion today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| So is there a motion to approve today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3558)|
| 0:59:26| I'll make a motion we approve to get it on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Well, he made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| He didn't get a second, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| He didn't get a second, but I'd rather hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| To which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| He has a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| Okay, let's go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| There's a motion to defer on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| We have a motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| We can discuss it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| So we can do a substitute if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| So we have a motion and a second to defer, and now we're going to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| I think Hugh, your office did a quick survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| Yes, Commissioner Brolls had asked us to do a survey through the State Purchasing Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3603)|
| 1:00:11| We put that out there, left it out about three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| We got 13 responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| I passed those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| We had nine public agencies that said they did contract for a lobbyist and four did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3618)|
| 1:00:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| So did they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| I guess you all didn't ask about finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| No, we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| We just wanted to know if that's something they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| Did you ask about the structure of any of those contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| We will do that moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| Now, it's my understanding that a lot of these agencies do not issue solicitations for these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| and they put them in what they call the professional services bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| I wouldn't recommend that because the state does not call this a professional service, and neither would I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3656)|
| 1:01:04| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| You know, when this first, well, I guess when we got rid of our lobbyists years ago, I was in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| But, you know, the more I dig into this, the more I think we need to consider having a presence in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3673)|
| 1:01:24| I guess Joe Lee gave us this write-up about all the bills that's going to be discussed and broken down by topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3684)|
| 1:01:38| We have folks that are representing us at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| They do a great job, but they're busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| And sometimes that day job isn't what's best for Knox County commission type issues to where they can't dig in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3706)|
| 1:01:54| I hear talk about the, you know, the Tennessee TCCA, whatever they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3714)|
| 1:02:02| But as I said before, they represent all counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| Urban counties are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| We are, again, like I said, try to get BEP fair and see how much support we'll get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3730)|
| 1:02:18| I don't think we'll get a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| So I think we need to consider structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| We're not going to prove it today like Brad said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| We don't have a budget or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| But I think even if we could reword this resolution to where we put together exploratory, bring back a proposal, what it's going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3750)|
| 1:02:42| I just think we need to understand that we're not getting our interests represented fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3762)|
| 1:02:51| and completely without someone there whose sole interest is putting Knox County on folks' brains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3771)|
| 1:02:59| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| I brought a handout that I gave to you all on topics that were finalized I think last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| So that was you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| That we got from the TCCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| This tells you topics to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| Is there suggestions to observe and to oppose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| Now, what else do you want from a lobbyist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| Do you want them to put bills before the House or the Senate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| Do you want them working on legislation for especially of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| If you want that, that's good for a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| But if you're just wanting general information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| I've got tons of stuff that I have got from the state that I read every week that they send to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3821)|
| 1:03:48| I think Brad Anders, Commissioner Anders, attended a meeting, what, three weeks ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| Were you in Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| Two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| Two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| Two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| There's also in these things where you have representation down there on the education, transportation, legislative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| that they have those subcommittees that you can have representation on also that you go to those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| But what do we want from a lobbyist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| Do we want a lobbyist just to have it, or is there a specific reason that we want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3853)|
| 1:04:21| Mr. McKenzie said, you know, what about the BEP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| Okay, we are a director, and our voices are heard as a directorship better than the smaller counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3865)|
| 1:04:33| You have Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga as directors on that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| So we have a voice, a strong voice down there about the BEP if that's what we want to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3879)|
| 1:04:48| But what is it we want from a lobbyist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| Is the juice worth the squeezing if we're just going to get a lobbyist just to be down there and walk the halls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| We're getting all that information now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| And Charlie Crisp is our representative on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| He's over there every day working for us, and he sends out this information every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| If you want to get on his e-mail list, he will send it to you every day just like a lobbyist would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| So if there's something more than we want in this information, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3914)|
| 1:05:20| So what do we want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| Can somebody tell me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| Well, I can tell you that once the, you know, he is representing, again, he's representing 95 counties as the lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3924)|
| 1:05:33| And I can tell you if we had strong influence through the directorship, as you say, BEP wouldn't be so dysfunctional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3933)|
| 1:05:42| BEP right now is dysfunctional, and it's because the big counties got overwhelmed in a vote of the State House and State Senate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3942)|
| 1:05:50| to the tune of our budget, about $40 million, and Sevier County, about $60 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3950)|
| 1:05:57| And so if you're to monitor these bills, I mean, we sat down, that was a meeting we went to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| We did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| We sat down with all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| But there's also the board that I sat on down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| There are counties that disagreed with part of this, and they, you know, we got into nitpicking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3971)|
| 1:06:18| well, it's good for us, but it's not good for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| And so these bills, as they go through, they go through fast, and they change fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| And the TCCA, as well as they do their job, can't monitor all amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| and as they happen on the floor, they're just gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| And once they're gone, they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| And so I think it's important that if we find bills that are important to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| and we trace the amendments that benefit or hurt us, those are the things we need a lobbyist for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=3998)|
| 1:06:45| outside of what the TCCA can provide for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| But there again, you know, you can attach something to a bill when it comes out of committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| Another legislator or senator can, as soon as it comes out of committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| he can add something to it, and it can go directly to the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| So, you know, our lobbyist, if he's not on the floor every day, he could miss it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4022)|
| 1:07:12| Then he wouldn't be a lobbyist very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| I've changed my position since this first came up because I do think we need a lobbyist in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| I think we need representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| This county is certainly big enough, deserves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| And if we're going to spend money, this is money well spent, I would think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| to have representation in the legislature looking out for our interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| not just letting us know what's coming up, but actually speaking for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| And I don't know the answer because I think we keep pushing this month after month after month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4058)|
| 1:07:45| and we might not ever get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| I might suggest that we look at a resolution where we set up a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| or someone to interview lobbyists, get some ideas of who wants to be a lobbyist for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4072)|
| 1:07:58| talk to people about it, and then come with a recommendation before the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| if we want to proceed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| I think it would have to come through an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| We would just kind of then we could evaluate it as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| but I think it would be an RFP would be the preferred method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| Is that correct for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| What I would recommend is obviously work with you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| maybe establish a committee to work with purchasing to develop a scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| And then from that scope of work, we would craft the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4110)|
| 1:08:37| And then possibly one, and I would suggest not having more than one commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| because it would require us to sunshine all the evaluation committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| and then make a vote or have the committee do their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| bring the results back here down to the full body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| and let the full commission take a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| Commissioner Busser, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| If we do decide to get, and I'm not against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| I'm just saying we've got to know what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| We've got to say, okay, this is why we're doing a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| And then once we put our RFP for it and we get applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| and they decide how do we know do we have people in place in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| that we can call and say this is the lobbyist we're choosing, what's he like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| that's on the floor, that's somebody you can trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| Do you have those people down there that can give you that information back on the lobbyist we hire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4173)|
| 1:09:41| Now, I was with the home builders for 30-something years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| and I was down there quite a bit in lobbying end of it, and you've got to know who you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| You have some that are very, very good, and there's a lot of them down there on the floor that are very, very bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4190)|
| 1:09:57| So you've got to have somebody down there that you can trust, that you can ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| this is the person we're choosing, how are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| And do we have that person down there that we can trust that will give us the proper answer of who we choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4207)|
| 1:10:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| I want to make a substitute motion to ask you to craft an RFP of some scope for a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4217)|
| 1:10:29| I don't know if, I guess it would be me and Hugh, and go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| You got an opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| I just think before we put out an RFP, we as a commission need to decide how we want to pay this person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| what type of structure of work they're going to be doing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| That way we can put out an RFP that's actually representative of what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| That's why I'm trying to figure out how to get that crafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4253)|
| 1:11:00| What's the best method of crafting an RFP with commissioner input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4260)|
| 1:11:06| I think at some level we need to have some kind of vote to say that we support the effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| and that I think will incentivize those lobbyists out there that they're not going to put together this big proposal just because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4272)|
| 1:11:20| I think that's a step that we're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| No guarantees in life, but we're interested in doing that and getting an affirmative vote if that's what this body wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4283)|
| 1:11:31| Then, like you say, just appointing a person to develop that RFP and maybe bring the RFP back to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4291)|
| 1:11:41| Is that out of order, Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| No, we can bring just the structure of the RFP itself back here for your blessing before we issue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4306)|
| 1:11:54| The finance director, Chris Caldwell, mentioned something, which we do quite often as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| is doing a blind selection where the evaluation committee has no idea who the proposers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4319)|
| 1:12:08| They just see their credentials, their work, and some people who are familiar with them could figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| But it levels the playing field a little bit more, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| So just food for thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| Hugh, would you be able to have an RFP brought before us for the next work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| Not an RFP, but a draft RFP that we can work through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| Yeah, working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| The question was asked, how do we know who we pick is worth anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4358)|
| 1:12:45| What's wrong with the people we elect who represent us down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| Some of those have been down there long enough to know who knows where the body's buried and who doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4370)|
| 1:12:57| You're assuming there are bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| So to me, if I was wanting to know if this person would represent Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| I would look for the representatives from Knox County and say, hey, yeah, he's done a good job for such and such and so and so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4387)|
| 1:13:15| Or, you know, he blew this out of the water and took their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| So I would, you know, I think there would be the go-to people to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| We could accomplish those things through client references.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| Obviously, and through the proposal process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| we reserve the right to consider all pertinent information that goes along with the transaction itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4413)|
| 1:13:40| We'll look at the company's resources, their past history in delivering these services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| their approach to delivering these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| There's a multitude of criteria out there that we can benchmark to measure these guys against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4427)|
| 1:13:54| I want to make a substitute motion to have Hugh bring a draft RFP to the next work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| to have a discussion as a discussion item and then potentially a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| Is that OK with you, Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| Does that sound workable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| Very workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| We have a motion and a second for Hugh to bring back an RFP working document that we can go through on work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| and exchange ideas out in the public there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| Everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| Yeah, let's move back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| Mr. Kiger has been able to arrive, so we'll go ahead and bring that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4483)|
| 1:14:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| I know a few of you had some questions that probably only Mr. Kiger can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| Here he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| Sam, did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| Somebody asked questions about the current slip availability in that unit, H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| Yeah, I need your name and address for the record, Mr. Kiger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| David Kiger, 1100 Fox Road, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4517)|
| 1:15:24| So is this H, is this an existing structure currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| What do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| This new dock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| I don't know if I had any questions of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| I guess in general there were questions as to the process that we came up with, you know, this prepay of $84,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4541)|
| 1:15:59| Is that something that's a normal process for when you're given a discount for a long-term lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4559)|
| 1:16:05| We have done five other ones in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| And they're all kind of different locations, different sizes, different kind of deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| But this one is probably the best location of all of the other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| And they're all between $75,000 and $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| You do know the county's not going out of business or anything like that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| I just want to put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| You know, and this isn't for you, Mr. Kiger, but, you know, I've thought some about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| And, you know, as the sheriff said, this isn't an emergency thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| So whether it's a quarter mile or eighth of a mile, I don't think that's germane to this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| So then I kind of look at, okay, well, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| Is it a lift? Is it this? Is it that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| And I really hadn't heard anything that just pushed me over the top that says that this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| this Front Street location, is something that's going to give us the bang for the buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4614)|
| 1:17:01| And that's going to, you know, for us to get to prepay this 10-year up front, I think, one, it's unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4621)|
| 1:17:10| It does what we talk about sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| It ties the hands of other commissions going forward, which we try best not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4631)|
| 1:17:17| And so I'd struggle with supporting this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4637)|
| 1:17:24| Mr. Smith, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| Just wanted to know how many other slips are available in Dock H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| Well, Dock H will be the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| That entire dock is coming online hopefully this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| We've worked out a deal to get the Sheriff's Department boat in there before it even becomes available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| But once it's online, there will be 12 slips on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| Mr. Coyle, I guess the concern I have is the long-term up front payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4667)|
| 1:17:54| If a bankruptcy happens or we're not protected as a county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| and our job is to protect as much as we can the county from any kind of liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| that seems like a long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| The price doesn't scare me over 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| It doesn't go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| And so that doesn't scare me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| But the up front payment startles me a little bit because if you go bankrupt or if something happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| if we have a catastrophic event down there and you can't recover from it, we're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| And so that's the only thing that concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| Well, and I'd like to think that John Owings has covered all of those concerns in the new lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| I can tell you if there was some sort of a financial issue, it would have happened 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| I've been down there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| Well, I'm just talking about, I mean, anything can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| Somebody can get sick and somebody, you know, the doc could dismantle and you can't get it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| I mean, there's all kinds of things that can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| And, I mean, we discussed it earlier before you got here in terms of the long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| and there's an out for the county, but it's also up to a bankruptcy trustee if it's a bankruptcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4732)|
| 1:18:58| And that's the only thing that scares me about this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| The only thing that startles me is that it's a one-time payment for a ten-year note that we don't have any guarantees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4740)|
| 1:19:09| in five years that we can get our money back if something does happen to the Marine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| Well, I certainly understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| The other deals that we did were kind of the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| They had their attorneys go through them seven ways from Sunday to make sure that they were comfortable with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| So I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| Is there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| I think we had somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| I'd like to talk to Sheriff Jones for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4769)|
| 1:19:43| Sheriff, I'd just kind of like to know, you know, what your feeling is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| Kind of sell us a little bit on it because obviously now it's a $500 a month increase to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4787)|
| 1:19:54| Is hauling gear a half a mile from parking area to your existing boat slip worth the $500 a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4794)|
| 1:20:04| There's many things that go into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| Where the boat is now is in a position at the far end of the dock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| which if you all have seen when it rains how that river flows and there are huge logs and debris that come in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4811)|
| 1:20:20| There's been a couple of times that we've gone and tried to get the boat out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| and we couldn't drop the lift because there was such a huge amount of debris around the lift and around the boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4823)|
| 1:20:31| And there's also been some damage to the boat from debris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| It is a long walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| I've gone down there and if someone had to carry diving gear and those types of things in an emergency situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4837)|
| 1:20:44| it would be strained at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| The location of where they want to give us a slip now is certainly ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4849)|
| 1:20:56| We looked at having the boat down west at a dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| We have a boat down west also that we keep down there for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| But as most of you know, the gas prices at boat dock prices are quite high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| So for us to make that 30 to 40 minute run in a boat back uptown is a huge cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4870)|
| 1:21:18| So we looked at that in determining this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| And we think the location certainly best fits our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| Why we're here before commission is because of the 10-year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| Any security issues that are pro-con being closer to the front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| Well, it is by the boathouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| It is by where a lot of the activity would be instead of being a half mile down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| We've not had any problems with security, but it certainly is being closer is where much more activity goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4903)|
| 1:21:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| There is a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| I think it was the last motion we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| Is everybody complete where they're at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4925)|

| 1:22:52| Commissioner Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4972)|

| 1:23:01| Commissioner McKenzie votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| Mr. Law Director, does the new lease, and I know that we haven't had it very long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| is there any protections that it were different than the ones that we had before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| Yes, there's protections, but the one of your concern, you really can't contract around bankruptcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| So whatever you do, whenever you do it, you're going to be kind of exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| I mean, that just goes with the territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5011)|
| 1:23:38| And we can, and we have an out within 60 days if we have a concern, or 30 days we have a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| we can walk away, get all our money back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| And what's the timeline you have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| If we have 30 days to put the county on notice of any change in ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| What about the county if they want out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| The county has 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| And so if we say we turn around, we want out, what's the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| You want out and you're refunded from that point forward, whatever that amount would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| If we change ownership year one, you're refunded nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| If we want out year three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| Refunded seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| What is the turnaround of that check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| Quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| No, what is the turnaround of that check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| Well, it's 30 days notice, 30 days notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| And we can certainly put a provision within the lease to say within 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| Is that acceptable, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5070)|
| 1:24:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| We haven't called the vote yet, and with that amendment I want to vote yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| but I want to make sure that everybody's, if we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| if we make an amendment, do we have to, what if, what's the rule there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5093)|
| 1:25:01| Well, you have an amendment to the contract or go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| you can recall the vote to include the motion for the amendment for the 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| I want to make a substitute motion that the 10 days, if the county opts out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| the owner has 10 days to refund the remainder of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| And that will be, that will make that as a motion prior to the vote being called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| So that's an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| Yes, that would be an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| Do you second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| Help me to understand this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| Are we amending the, are you interested in the 30-day window where we can walk away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| or are you more so interested in the life of the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| I want the check back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| If we walk out, I want the check back in 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| That's the only difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| That's the only difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| Who's liable for the check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| Who's liable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| Is it a corporation, the company, Mr. Kiger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| Who's going to be liable for the check to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| Volunteer Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| The company, LLC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| Let's do a voice vote and see how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5177)|

| 1:27:25| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5247)|
| 1:27:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| I think we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| Until we go to the other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| Commissioner Brown, your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| We don't have a caption or a number yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| For the $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| You ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| Chris, do you mind coming down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| Commissioner Brown is going to add a $15,000 sesquicentent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| I can't even say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| I can't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| Sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5283)|

| 1:28:11| Sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| Sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| Sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| I can't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| Celebration for the 150 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| So, has he had that discussion with you and we have money in general fund to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| It's the finale of the statewide sesquicentennial, I think is how you say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| And, you know, what I may say is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| and I don't know if we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| I asked the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| If we had some flexibility, whether it's either the general fund or the Hotel Motel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| Hotel Motel is doing really well right now, and that would be an event that would promote tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5323)|
| 1:28:50| So that does make sense, but I don't want to tie my hands in saying which spot to take it from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| So the motion would be to allocate $15,000 to be pulled from either Hotel Motel tax at preference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| but if not general fund, and we'll do that as a defined service contract through purchasing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5342)|
| 1:29:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| Yes, that would have been made, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| The commission will allow the what is your title, Calvin Chairman, President, Dictator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5353)|
| 1:29:23| Most of you all know Calvin Chappelle, who is the headmaster over at House on the Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5363)|
| 1:29:32| Mabry Hazen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| He's also, you know, this commission authorized three years ago the formation of a sesquicentennial committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5374)|
| 1:29:44| because we knew at that time that the closing ceremony would be here in Knoxville, which I'm only going to take a lot of his time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5384)|
| 1:29:54| I'd ask Calvin if he would kind of give us a little bit of an update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| and I think he may have some pass-outs to kind of give him a little bit of a schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| Now, while you're doing that, this will be the closing ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| It will be like a two-and-a-half-day event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| There will be thousands of people coming in here from all over, not only just Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| but some of you are Civil War buffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| Arthur Seymour, I'm sure, will be here for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| Are you saying he was there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| Beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| Was he there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| He was there, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| At any rate, it's going to be a big event, so Calvin, if you would, kind of give them a little bit of a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| Sure, and I may just repeat a little bit what Mike said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| The state, and for the record, Calvin Chappell, 1616 Washington Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| the state of Tennessee for each year of the 150th anniversary of the Civil War has chosen a state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5446)|
| 1:30:52| or city rather, to host its signature event, their commemorative event, because we commemorate the war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| We don't celebrate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| And Knoxville has been chosen for the last year of those commemorations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5460)|
| 1:31:06| And historically, Knoxville held 1890 and 1895 Blue and Gray Reunions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| where the veterans came back as a way of kind of moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| The African-American perspective was largely overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| And this time around, in 2015, in conjunction with the state activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| the local organizations are hosting a Blue and Gray Reunion and Freedom Jubilee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| which will host four days of events that really span a lot of different topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5488)|
| 1:31:34| but they all come together with ideas of reconciliation, remembrance, and reunion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5494)|
| 1:31:41| We're doing a lot of things in East Knoxville that specifically inform the public about the first United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| colored heavy artillery, which were African-Americans mustered here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| fought for the Union forces here in Knoxville and surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| We will have commemorative events, exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| There are some other things in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| I'm happy to talk more about the specific programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| But the $15,000 that we are requesting from the county would go specifically towards African-American programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| We'd like to bring a $5,000 exhibit from the African-American Civil War Museum in Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5531)|
| 1:32:18| Tibet Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| At the same time, in conjunction with that event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| we're unveiling records about the first United States colored heavy artillery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| So those two things dovetail together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| Another $5,000 would go to pay for a speaker to come to Haley Heritage Square to be part of the Freedom Jubilee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5549)|
| 1:32:37| which is really the celebration and commemoration of the African-Americans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| not only their participation in the war, but their struggle through that war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5563)|
| 1:32:49| And then lastly, the remaining $5,000 would go to pay for living historians, people who portray Frederick Douglass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5569)|
| 1:32:56| Harriet Tubman, possibilities of working with carpetbag theater, a lot of different activities that would occur there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5576)|
| 1:33:02| in Haley Heritage Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| The total budget for this four-day event is really about $63,000, of which we've raised about $43,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5584)|
| 1:33:13| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| Thank you, and thank you, Mr. Pell, for kind of spearheading this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5596)|
| 1:33:23| At one point, you were talking about bringing the Fisk Jubilee Singers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| Is that going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| Yeah, the Fisk Jubilee Singers are coming, and that's under the state's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| So, you know, me being a proud graduate of Fisk University, I am extremely honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| And I encourage you all to take the time out to visit all of these things, but especially that piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5616)|
| 1:33:45| So thank you again for, you know, oftentimes we, you know, history is a very unique bug and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5625)|
| 1:33:55| thing that we all kind of get passionate about at one time or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| But the African-American experience in the Civil War is extremely unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| and it's good that you all are shining a little light on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Commissioner Moran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| If I may, I'd like to go back for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| When we started out with the committee, we started with the leaders in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| who were the experts in this type of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| We had Joan Markoff from McClung Museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| I'm afraid to name them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| I'm going to miss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| But we had Cheryl Henderson from the East Tennessee Historical Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5672)|
| 1:34:39| With Calvin back here today is Steve Dean, who did all of the series with Bill Landry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5679)|
| 1:34:50| Heartland, I couldn't remember what they were, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| So these folks have been working for three years to try to get all of us together to have a fantastic event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5693)|
| 1:35:01| We're just hoping right now, keeping our fingers crossed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| if the city gets on the ball and gets the entrance to Fort Dickerson done before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| we're saying now midsummer, which they ain't going to get it for us because this is the end of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5708)|
| 1:35:13| So I'd just like to thank this committee personally for all the work that they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| The Civil War Roundtables, East Tennessee Civil War,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| every Civil War faction that we could drum up, think up, ask in has been a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5722)|
| 1:35:32| And it's coming to a good fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| Calvin has done a great job spearheading this last year of, you know, kind of putting the final acts together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5734)|
| 1:35:42| A famous playwright, David Madden, has sponsored a play that will be presented here with a $5,000 cash award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5742)|
| 1:35:51| Is that right, Calvin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| So it's a lot of good stuff and big stuff going on, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| So we've got reason to fluff our feathers and, you know, strut our stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5756)|
| 1:36:03| So this is to help out with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| That was Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| Commissioner Roth, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| I thought we had already had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| I think we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| I don't think they got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| So I just want to make sure we have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5782)|
| 1:36:28| We vote on it twice, they get double the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| What about you, Steve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5801)|
| 1:36:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Thank you, Mr. Chappelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| Thanks, Calvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| We have just discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| We've got a couple of presentations for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| So is Dr. McIntyre still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| Dr. McIntyre, he may need to call school tomorrow, so let's go ahead and get him out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5821)|
| 1:37:08| He's become that of a Twitter hero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| Commissioner Bussler had a discussion item for, he had sent an e-mail, I think, about the PLEs and the TCAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5833)|
| 1:37:19| So, Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| Dr. McIntyre, it's a pleasure to have you up here to talk about a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| And I just want to thank you for inviting me out to South Dole on the PLE, which I think is one of your initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5846)|
| 1:37:34| what you are really pushing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| And I just wanted the rest of the commission to see or understand what I saw out at South Dole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5856)|
| 1:37:43| And I would want you to explain it because I think it's something interesting that they would like to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5863)|
| 1:37:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| I'm Jim McIntyre, superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| We're at 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| And our personalized learning environment initiative or PLE initiative, as Commissioner Bussler mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5881)|
| 1:38:09| is really an important part of our future, a really important part of our strategic plan in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| Last summer, our school board adopted a five-year strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| It's entitled Excellence for Every Child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| And a significant component of that really speaks to meeting the individual learning needs of each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| and every one of our 58,000 plus students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| And in order to do that, there's a variety of strategies that we lay out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| but certainly rigorous instruction and high expectations and standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| but also thinking about how we can personalize learning for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| And so in thinking about how to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| and recognizing that resources are limited, two years ago now we did a sort of an internal competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5927)|
| 1:38:56| We identified some resources within the general fund budget and from some other sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| And we did a sort of an internal competition within the Knox County schools to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| if you had comprehensive instructional technology in your school, what would you do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| And what would that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| And how could you enhance teaching in the classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| And how can you enhance student learning if that were the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| And so we did what we called our school technology challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| And schools had to answer that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| and really think about how they would use instructional technology in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| And our teachers literally had to sign on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| They had to sign a statement that said if they got the resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| they would go to additional professional development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| that they would utilize those instructional technology resources in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| They would learn about them and continue their growth and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| So we now have 13 schools where we have what I would call comprehensive instructional technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| That means at grades 4 through 12, it's a one-to-one initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| One device for every student and one device for every teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5992)|
| 1:39:57| And that's right now for grades 4 through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| That's a laptop computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| The selection was made by our teachers for a MacBook Pro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| which is in terms of usability and durability and functionality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| was the choice that our teachers thought would be the best device for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| And then in grades K through 3, it's more of what we call a blended learning initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| which means we have significant instructional technology in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| but it's not necessarily a device for every child or a device for every teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| but more utilizing that technology in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| A couple weeks ago now, we had our personalized learning environment showcase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| where those 13 schools were able to come forward and talk about what this has meant for their schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| and the learning in their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| And I appreciate that Commissioner Bussel was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| Commissioner Brown was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| And I believe Commissioner Owenby was also there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| So thank you for attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| It was a great opportunity to really highlight the work that's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| and to really showcase what the technology can do for the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6057)|
| 1:41:03| And I think that's an important point when we're talking about personalized learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| Our personalized learning initiative, it's really not about the technology at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| It's really about what our teachers can do and what our kids can do when they have that tool in their hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6071)|
| 1:41:17| when they have that tool in their classroom and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| And Theresa Nixon, who's our Director of Instructional Technology, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| She can certainly answer questions at a more detailed level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| But I think I'll tell you two quick examples of the power of this instructional technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6087)|
| 1:41:34| First of all, Robbie Howard, who's a math teacher at South Doyle High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| was able to teach county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| and school board members a little calculus using the technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| So you can tell it's very powerful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| And our students were actually a big part of that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| and demonstrating how the technology can enhance learning and teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| And then I think the other interesting example is just this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| We've been out of school for inclement weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| And we have had, in those 13 schools, the learning continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| My son, for example, is a ninth grader at Bearden High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| And much to his chagrin, he had assignments this past week in AP Human Geography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| and in Geometry that he was expected to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| And the communication that occurs is using the technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| It's using a learning management system that we call Canvas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| And there's just this opportunity for learning to continue sort of around the clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6145)|
| 1:42:31| and around the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| Robbie Howard, again, the math teacher at South Doyle who we saw last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| sent out through Canvas videos for his AP Calculus course this past week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| because the AP Calculus exam is at a date certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| And they're not changing that because we have more snow days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| So those students are learning this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| They're getting a lecture from Mr. Howard and some homework from Mr. Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| And again, they may not be all that excited about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| but it shows the power of the technology and the ways that you can use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| I think it also just unlocks a variety of resources for our students in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6184)|
| 1:43:12| you know, just learning tools that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| And also I think it allows our teachers to be as sort of even more creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6194)|
| 1:43:21| and innovative and engaging with their instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| And so we've seen some really powerful teaching going on in our classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| where we have this technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| And we've seen some really powerful learning in our classrooms where we have this technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| And I believe this is something that we need to think about for the future of the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| I personally would like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| We have it in 13 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| I'd like to see it in all 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| But, of course, it's an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| And, of course, it requires additional resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| But I do believe it's our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| And I believe it's where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| I can't do justice to what the commissioner saw and learned at the showcase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| except to say that I think when you see it in action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| and when you see the types of learning opportunities that are opened up by this type of instructional technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6239)|
| 1:44:06| it's just very compelling and I think a great way for us to support the really what we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6246)|
| 1:44:14| we want excellence for every child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| We want to meet the individual learning needs of each and every one of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| This is an important tool in our ability to do exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| And I'm glad to take questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6264)|
| 1:44:25| And Ms. Nixon will be glad to take questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| Dr. McIntyre, one thing that I saw out there that you were talking about and when I sent a reply back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| I said there's some pros and cons to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| And one of the things I was looking at that teachers work real hard and I was wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6276)|
| 1:44:41| one of the students told me when they were walking through there, said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| you know, I could be working on my test tonight and I could send my teacher an e-mail and she could reply back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6284)|
| 1:44:52| So that teacher is working after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| And then the technology, the technology is ramping up so rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6296)|
| 1:45:04| I mean, from what we were five years ago to what we are now in technology and how it's advancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| And then you've got to have repair to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| As a commissioner, I'm not jumping on you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| But how much are we looking on the ROI when we invest in this system that you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6315)|
| 1:45:25| What is the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| What's the cost to teachers' time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| Will we burn out teachers if they're working from seven in the morning to seven at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| and teachers are getting information from kids that want more information after class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6333)|
| 1:45:39| And, you know, how is that going to affect their teaching, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| as far as investment in the money and the teachers and the technology?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| How about the repair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| How is repair going on that and how much do we need to budget for the repair on the computers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| and how much do we have to invest in new computers because the old ones will wear out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| And some kids don't always take care of their technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| I've got a grandson that has broke two iPhone 6s here lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| He thinks money just grows out of, you know, off of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| But, you know, there's things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| And so I was wondering, is that some of the cons that you have to deal with in getting this new program going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6373)|
| 1:46:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6380)|
| 1:46:21| I think those are all challenges that we need to grapple with and think through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| and develop responses to and we've been doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| I think the good news is we're not alone in this endeavor and in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| Just this past year, we were invited to join the Digital Promise Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| It's called the League of Innovative Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| and it's a very highly selective community of school districts that are trying to do some of this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6403)|
| 1:46:50| with instructional technology around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| And so it's places like Mooresville, North Carolina, that's really recognized as a leader in instructional technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6412)|
| 1:46:59| in the classroom that we are working with and learning from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| and sharing experiences with and learning best practices from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| I'll let Ms. Nixon address some of the questions that you raised, but to say a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| First of all, our teachers are working hard every day, those that have the technology and those that don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| And, you know, they're working nights and weekends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| and they're just an incredibly hardworking, dedicated, committed group of educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6441)|
| 1:47:27| And I think what I hear from some of them is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| I'd rather have a kid send me an email and I can respond in three minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| and get them right back on the right track rather than having to sort of reteach the whole lesson the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6453)|
| 1:47:40| It's more efficient in a lot of ways in terms of that communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| Is it an additional burden in some way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| Sure, but I think it's also advantageous in a lot of ways to that student's learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| and they can get them back on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| You know, Robbie Howard talks about sort of, he does, he will sometimes do a half hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6474)|
| 1:48:00| where he'll schedule a time when students can sort of chat with him online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| And he says, I can do it from the comfort of my living room, my easy chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| but that time that I invest, and I can structure when it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| and that time that I invest is incredibly valuable to student learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| and saves me time the next day in terms of my teaching that I can keep focused on the lesson that I had at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6496)|
| 1:48:23| In terms of investment, it is a significant investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| Our initial foray into this was with 11 schools, and it was about a $6 million program, if I remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6505)|
| 1:48:31| So, yeah, if you do the math out to 90 schools, it's a significant investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| But I do think there's, again, opportunities where in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| then you're probably not going to be, you know, five years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| we're probably not going to be buying hardcover textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| I mean, all of that will be digital content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| All of that will be online learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| And I think, again, we've asked our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| we've asked our teachers to meet these incredibly high standards in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| and here locally in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| And this is one tool that I feel strongly can help us, can help our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6540)|
| 1:49:05| and our teachers meet those very rigorous standards we've put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| And I'd love for Ms. Nixon to be able to react to some of the other questions that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6548)|
| 1:49:16| I'm Teresa Nixon, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| And, Commissioner Bussler, thank you for those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| We do encourage teachers to offer, as Dr. McIntyre has said, office hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| so they aren't expected to respond 24-7 at all times with their e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| Many of them do say, if you have a certain number of questions, email me by 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| And then tonight, after I put my own children to bed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| I will be happy to come online and answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| And you can continue on to be able to do your homework in an appropriate way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| Another thing you mentioned was about the responsibility of the devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| And this is a great opportunity for us when we actually do device deployment at each of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6594)|
| 1:50:01| Both students and parents go through a process where we talk about the importance of caring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6601)|
| 1:50:07| and how to care for the devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| And sometimes I watch my own nieces and nephews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| I mean, they just pick up my iPhone and just go to town and start playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| And I haven't properly instructed them on the best way to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| And so those are things that we actually work on and use it as a learning experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| including the concept of digital citizenship so that our students are responsible in the digital world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6628)|
| 1:50:35| so that in social media, which is a very hot thing for teenagers now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| they are learning to be responsible in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6640)|
| 1:50:46| While I was talking about the teachers, I worked for 34 years out of my house, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| And after a while, I didn't want to go home because I was bothered on Saturdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| and Sundays and 10, 11 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| And that's what I'm afraid some of the teachers are going to get involved in unless they put a hard line on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6660)|
| 1:51:06| It's a good thing to be able to be in contact with your teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| but the teachers also need some rest period, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| And if they're working those longer hours, well, are they going to be compensated for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| And how are they going to be compensated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| That would be another thing I would be asking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| But, you know, that's your part of the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| I'm just finding out what it may cost us down the road when you're needing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| And I know it's after school time, so you should be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| I don't want to keep you after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| But anyway, there's a couple of things I need to ask of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| Number one, the benchmarks in schools are the third and fifth grade in the elementary school levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| And I need to get from you all, since we're doing budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| maybe the TCAP scores from the third and fifth grade for the current year and previous four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6706)|
| 1:51:52| If we have that, see how we're progressing there along so we know how the schools are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| And if I could do that, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| If I could pick it up the next day or so, I'd love to get that from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| And the other thing regarding that we talked about, and like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| this is a TCA deal regarding a communication between the schools and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6728)|
| 1:52:16| In the county commission, we are entrusted with the funds and how things are used in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6736)|
| 1:52:24| And this is one issue in Knox that I'm not going to make sure we get our understanding with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6744)|
| 1:52:33| It says that if there is a problem in the school system, and I was going to get my sheet out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6753)|
| 1:52:41| It says in TCA Code 49-2-301 under Section U, it says report to the local legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6761)|
| 1:52:52| This is the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6772)|
| 1:52:53| This is the director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| It says, and I understand that you are director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| It says report to the legislative body, which is us, and the commissioner, which I think is the state commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6780)|
| 1:53:08| Whenever it appears that the director thinks that any portion of the school's funds are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6788)|
| 1:53:14| or has been or in danger of being misappropriated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| or any other way illegally disposed of are not collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6798)|
| 1:53:23| That was one of the things that needed to report to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| Let me give you the timeline of this last, say, Mr. Underwood's deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| In the paper on the 28th of October, it was reported in the paper of what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| On the 30th, there was a letter written by your office to come to us here to the county commission to report to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6816)|
| 1:53:43| But it only went to Brad Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| It was addressed to him, and this is the legislative body, from my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| And I'm not, this is my understanding of what I'd like to get from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| Is if something like that happens, report back to the legislative body, which is us, where we can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6835)|
| 1:54:01| And from, I know Brad just kind of overlooked it, but it wasn't until the 17th of the next month that I got your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6841)|
| 1:54:10| And the report was more of a news release than it was a report of what really happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6850)|
| 1:54:17| And I had people asking me, I go to the gym every morning at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6857)|
| 1:54:22| And on the morning of the 28th, I was in the gym working out, and I had people in my area asking what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6862)|
| 1:54:29| So I was waiting for a report to come back, and I never did get one until the 17th, like I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6869)|
| 1:54:34| And it was kind of a miscommunication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| But if my understanding from the TCA codes, and if I'm wrong, I can be corrected here by the law director here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6876)|
| 1:54:44| that report directly to us first, but it seemed like it was reported to the newspaper first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| And I was kind of taken aback by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| We would like, you know, our communication to be straightforward, straight to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| if something happens in there, to where we can look at it, like Mr. Underwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| and that we get the information that we need and not just kind of like a news release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6900)|
| 1:55:05| And that makes it better so we can kind of dampen the public's reaction to what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6905)|
| 1:55:11| Because I had a lot of people out in my area that was really upset that things like that were happening without oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6911)|
| 1:55:18| And, you know, with a little bit of knowledge, I could have dampened some of that, but I didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6918)|
| 1:55:24| And I would like to have it in the future, if that's all right with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| And basically that's what I wanted to talk to you about, the PLE, which is good, the TCA codes, what we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6927)|
| 1:55:37| and then I need something when we're doing budgets to see how we're progressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| So if somebody's asking for more money, if we need to get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6941)|
| 1:55:45| I can explain why we need it and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| That's why I was wanting those TCAT scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6948)|
| 1:55:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| And we're glad to provide those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| And with regard to the reporting, you know, I guess I assumed a letter to the chairman meets the statutory obligation for notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6953)|
| 1:56:02| And, you know, if it doesn't, we can certainly just CC all the members or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| That's not a problem we can't rectify for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| And certainly we don't, as you know, don't always have control over what the media reports when they report it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| And if we could just ask them to hold off on reporting anything until we can communicate it with the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| that would be terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| But I'm not sure they'll go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| But I will make sure that in the future, as we meet that statutory obligation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| that we will copy all the commissioners and not just the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| In a report form, not as a news release, but tell us what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| Not just misuse of a credit card and it's been released from his job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=6997)|
| 1:56:44| and we're putting things, you know, we're working on things that we want to keep from this from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7004)|
| 1:56:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7013)|
| 1:56:54| You know, I think we have an obligation to inform the legislative body when we have suspicions of, I think it's fraudulent use of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7014)|
| 1:57:04| And we will certainly meet that obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| I think the substance of that is really going to depend on the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| and how much we know at that point in time and how much we have verified at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7030)|
| 1:57:16| I mean, I think there's a balance here to be struck between timeliness and the level of detail that one can get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7036)|
| 1:57:24| So we'll certainly commit to providing as much information as soon as we can and certainly meet our obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7044)|
| 1:57:30| But that is, I think that's always the tradeoff that we're facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| Well, yeah, but I read more in the paper than I read in your report to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7053)|
| 1:57:39| And that was kind of disconcerting because, you know, we've got to work together in the county to make the county grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7059)|
| 1:57:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7064)|
| 1:57:45| Like I told you earlier in our conversation what my idea for the county was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7069)|
| 1:57:50| And I want to get that out of the way so when we're communicating that we get full communication between each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7070)|
| 1:57:56| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| I think that good communication between the county commission and the school board and myself, I think, is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| And I'll certainly do my part to make sure that you get as timely and accurate and detailed information as we can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7083)|
| 1:58:12| Sir, I sure do appreciate you coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| And thanks for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| And the PLE I was impressed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7095)|
| 1:58:18| It's exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| Quick, we beat the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| Go ahead, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7102)|
| 1:58:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| Dr. McIntyre, while I've got you on the hot spot here, I've got a question regarding one item that we approved earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7106)|
| 1:58:33| That's a contract with Compass Learning for instructional software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7113)|
| 1:58:38| It says $4,200 per site per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7118)|
| 1:58:44| Now, is a site per school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7124)|
| 1:58:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7130)|
| 1:58:51| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| So you've got 80-some schools and a town of 4,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7133)|
| 1:58:57| No, so that's software that we use for online learning and credit recovery and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7137)|
| 1:59:04| So it's typically secondary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| So it might only be, I can't actually check on this, but I believe it may only be high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7146)|
| 1:59:11| This is not stuff that's available on Google and whatnot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| It's for a high school guy to go in if he fails something or misses something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| He can go back and get the credit and retain it instead of going to summer school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| Yes, this is probably saving us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| You're taking a full course online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7170)|
| 1:59:31| Maybe I'm not understanding it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| Yes, thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| Mr. Lawson, are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7182)|
| 1:59:43| You want to go ahead and we'll get that knocked out and Mr. Hill, we'll knock yours out as soon as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| I don't think Mr. Lawson's will take very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| We'll get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| I'm Alan Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| I'm director of the Knoxville-Knox County Emergency Management Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| It's at 605 Bernard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| Commissioner Busler had asked me to come and give you just a brief understanding about our incident command system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7203)|
| 2:00:12| kind of how things go when we have a large-scale event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7212)|
| 2:00:16| When we were talking two or three weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| I didn't think I'd have as recent examples of this as I've got looking at what we've had over the past week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7218)|
| 2:00:26| But there is something called the National Incident Management System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7226)|
| 2:00:30| It's something that we operate under and everywhere in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| It's really a condition for accepting Homeland Security money is you operate under this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7235)|
| 2:00:42| And it provides a common terminology, a common method of operation for large-scale events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7242)|
| 2:00:50| one of those of which is the Emergency Operations Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| which we had going last week because of our weather situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7253)|
| 2:01:00| And that's something where we have representatives from emergency services as well as the Red Cross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7260)|
| 2:01:08| the health department, engineering is involved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7268)|
| 2:01:13| And we use it to make a coordinated decision about how we respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| And one of the things we did this past week is we have what we call TRT teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7276)|
| 2:01:22| which are four-wheel drive vehicles with medics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| and we use them to respond to calls where it's difficult to get an ambulance or a fire truck to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7285)|
| 2:01:33| when it's appropriate to respond with just the medic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7293)|
| 2:01:38| And these are comprised of teams from the fire department, rural metro, rural metro EMS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7298)|
| 2:01:46| rescue squad, and Karnes Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| And so we can control or coordinate that response from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7309)|
| 2:01:54| And we also have a representative of the Red Cross there, so if we have shelter operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7314)|
| 2:01:59| we have them immediately handy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7319)|
| 2:02:04| So really the two points I'd like to make about that is how important it is that you support that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7324)|
| 2:02:16| I saw there's one item on your agenda today about the Medical Reserve Corps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| something the health department uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| And this provides us a reserve of people with medical training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| If we have some sort of catastrophic event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| we have additional resources we could throw on a large-scale mass casualty event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7350)|
| 2:02:39| The other thing I'd mention is if we got into a situation kind of like what Crossville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| or the Plateau is facing now that is really extraordinarily beyond their ability to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7364)|
| 2:02:52| and they're needing outside resources, what they're going to get into is what's called a long-term recovery event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7372)|
| 2:02:59| You can imagine the disruption to business, unemployment that results from this kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| the infrastructure that's damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| And so support when we get to that kind of situation would be very critical, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7387)|
| 2:03:14| So that's just, I don't want to take up a lot of your time, but just if you have any questions, I'm glad to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| One of the questions I'd ask you is everybody has a certain thing that they can do while they're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7398)|
| 2:03:25| while we have one of these incidents going out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| And I didn't know if the county commission in any way had any involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| If it was a very large incident to occur, what would be our responsibilities as commissioners to the team effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7412)|
| 2:03:39| of getting us back online where we should be at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7419)|
| 2:03:42| I think the, when things are really urgent, not at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7422)|
| 2:03:49| but like I said the particularly supporting things before and that long-term recovery event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7429)|
| 2:03:56| they're set up long-term recovery committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7436)|
| 2:04:00| We had this after the Katrina evacuees came to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| You know, all these housing issues and all the things like that I think would be very important for y'all to be a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7444)|
| 2:04:16| Mr. Lawson, I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7457)|
| 2:04:18| Long week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| It has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| Last, one of the last things on our agenda is Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| I think you wanted to come up and talk about the northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| We asked you to come up and talk about the northwest county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| Just kind of where we're at with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| And go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| Commission members, first of all, we're very appreciative of the fact that you're actually scheduling a briefing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7477)|
| 2:04:44| for a sector plan that is in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| So we just want to give you a brief snapshot of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7487)|
| 2:04:52| By way of introduction, just to remind you, we have six county sector plans that are kind of married| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7492)|
| 2:05:00| and part of the puzzle for Knox County relative to six city sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7500)|
| 2:05:07| So we have east, north, and south county sector plans that were updated in 2011, 2012, and 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7507)|
| 2:05:16| This will be a very active period of time for the remaining three sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7516)|
| 2:05:21| which are the northwest county, southwest county, and the northeast county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7521)|
| 2:05:28| And each of these have very distinct characters, and they have very distinct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7528)|
| 2:05:33| and different needs and rates of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7533)|
| 2:05:38| So I wanted to just alert you that we have more than just northwest county sector plan going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7538)|
| 2:05:44| but I will also tell you that between northwest county and southwest county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7544)|
| 2:05:49| those are probably the two fastest growing areas in all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| So they pose particular challenges, I think, that may have sparked the interest in getting a briefing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7554)|
| 2:06:02| So with that, I will stop and ask Liz Albertson to give you a briefing on the northwest county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7562)|
| 2:06:13| Do you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7573)|
| 2:06:22| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| I'm Liz Albertson with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| I'm a comprehensive planner, and I've been working to update the northwest county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| Our sector plans help guide our land use decision-making, particularly at the time of rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7591)|
| 2:06:36| and plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| They are the implementing tool of the general plan and the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| Our sector boundaries are drawn along census tracks and are generally unchanging boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7602)|
| 2:06:48| We're about halfway through the process at this point in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| We've had our first round of community input, including community meetings and a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7611)|
| 2:06:57| and now we're drafting the land use plan to reflect the community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7617)|
| 2:07:01| and growth trends in the northwest county sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| We hope to go out for review of the draft plan with the public in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7624)|
| 2:07:09| and the northwest county sector is comprised of many communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7629)|
| 2:07:13| some of which are our fastest growing ones, such as Hardin Valley and Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| These are our character areas to help orient ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| I'm going to describe a bit of the boundaries of the northwest county sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| To the north is Melton Hill Lake in Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| Toward Powell is Clinton Highway, Shod Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7649)|
| 2:07:33| and bordering Clinton Highway is the northwest city sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7653)|
| 2:07:39| Along Oak Ridge Highway and Western Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7659)|
| 2:07:42| McKamey Road and Amherst Road to Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7662)|
| 2:07:46| and then North Gullahard View Road to I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| This is the second largest of all of our sectors geographically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7670)|
| 2:07:55| It's about a 77-square-mile area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| The last time the sector plan was updated was in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| It will be required to be adopted by both county commission and city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7682)|
| 2:08:08| The Knox County jurisdiction within this sector is about 89.3% of this sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7688)|
| 2:08:16| The city of Knoxville is about 10% of the sector, and the town of Farragut is about 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7696)|
| 2:08:23| This sector has experienced sustained growth since the 1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7703)|
| 2:08:28| It's the largest in population of all the sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| Accordingly, the school zones have experienced similar growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| and development activity has increased extensively with over 7,000 new residential units coming online since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7716)|
| 2:08:47| 351 of the non-residential projects have also occurred in this sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| Nineteen of those were residential, and we've rezoned almost 6,000 acres of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7733)|
| 2:09:01| Residential subdivisions are about almost 700 in number, and just over 5,000 lots have been created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7741)|
| 2:09:13| This map shows a decade's worth of building permits, and the orange are single-family residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7753)|
| 2:09:19| the green are multifamily residential, and the red are office or commercial, and the purple are industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7759)|
| 2:09:28| What's most notable about the map is the scattered distribution of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| The market is driving commercial development along our major arterials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7772)|
| 2:09:37| and residential out into our rural and agricultural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7777)|
| 2:09:43| This map shows our sector plan amendments that have occurred since 2003 across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7783)|
| 2:09:50| It's split up by our sector areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7790)|
| 2:09:54| You can see that the greatest number of sector plan amendments have occurred in the northwest county sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7794)|
| 2:10:00| There have been 99 plan amendments since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| If we look at the county overall, the red areas and orange areas have seen the greatest number of plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7804)|
| 2:10:13| The yellow areas have seen less plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| The next highest is the northeast county sector, which experienced 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7817)|
| 2:10:22| You can tell that a substantial number of amendments have occurred in the northwest county sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| Almost 500 acres of land designated as agricultural and rural residential has been amended since our last sector plan update for other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7827)|
| 2:10:37| In the technology corridor, which is the area along the Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7837)|
| 2:10:41| over 60% of the sector plan amendments within this area were for commercial, and almost 20% were for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7841)|
| 2:10:50| This shows an image of what the technology corridor boundaries look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7850)|
| 2:10:54| It was enacted by state legislature in 1983 as an economic development tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7854)|
| 2:11:00| to help stimulate technology-related uses within the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| Now there is a project review board called the Tennessee Technology Corridor Development Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7865)|
| 2:11:12| that reviews development within the corridor and makes recommendations based on design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7872)|
| 2:11:20| particularly within the area that you see in the flesh-toned color that's primarily the area zone TO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7880)|
| 2:11:29| The tech corridor plan was last updated in 2008, and several mixed-use areas were proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7889)|
| 2:11:39| It noted the impact of 475 going through this area at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7899)|
| 2:11:44| It was still on the table then, the infamous Orange Route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7904)|
| 2:11:47| That has since been removed and is not part of the plan anymore at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7907)|
| 2:11:53| but we need to amend the land-use plan to take away some of that right-of-way that was in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7913)|
| 2:11:59| and show that as a different land-use category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| Mixed-use development is generally what was recommended around some of these major intersections along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7923)|
| 2:12:10| Pellissippi Parkway, particularly where 475 would have crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7930)|
| 2:12:14| We'll probably be recommending just an extension of the mixed-use in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| It's also important to note that because land suitability is decreasing for technology-related uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7939)|
| 2:12:25| in the corridor that we need to continue to allow for those uses within these mixed-use areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7945)|
| 2:12:31| particularly in the flatter land areas that are better for that type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| Emerging issues that have come out through both our review of the public comments that we've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7956)|
| 2:12:46| through our meetings as well as in our survey was this concern regarding the sustained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7966)|
| 2:12:53| and scattered growth that's happening, that there isn't real definitive patterns to where the growth is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7973)|
| 2:13:00| It's not really following necessarily where our infrastructure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7980)|
| 2:13:05| Also, vehicular transportation concerns, so heavy congestion at a lot of the major intersections, system capacity problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7985)|
| 2:13:13| Walkability and cycling have come out at a number of public events that we've had, particularly around the school areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=7993)|
| 2:13:21| Desire for more sidewalks and connectivity around the schools to make it easier for students to get to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8001)|
| 2:13:28| particularly when they're in those parental responsibility zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| Also, making sure that we acknowledge the fact that schools are growth catalysts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8012)|
| 2:13:37| that they do have major impacts on the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| In this sector, we've seen two new schools go in, Amherst Elementary and Hardin Valley Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8021)|
| 2:13:47| and both of which have seen a substantial number of probably related residential subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8027)|
| 2:13:54| that have gone in related to those schools being established there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8034)|
| 2:13:57| We've also seen a decline in land suitable for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| Part of this is because of the housing boom that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| There were a lot of requests that looked at changes from land use, from being office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8043)|
| 2:14:13| or commercial for some of the technology-related uses being changed to residential through the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8053)|
| 2:14:21| We've quickly chipped away at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8061)|
| 2:14:23| and we need to consider where expansion for employment is going to go in this corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8063)|
| 2:14:29| given the limitation of some of the flatter land areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| Also, limited road access, floodplains, and steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8072)|
| 2:14:38| We need to really try to have our plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8078)|
| 2:14:43| make sure that we are allowing for some of these more heavier technology-related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| manufacturing-type uses as well in the sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8087)|
| 2:14:52| There's also been a loss of rural character in Small Town Phil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| We've heard that at a number of public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8095)|
| 2:14:58| Since this area has been growing so rapidly since the 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| I think it's finally starting to hit a point where people in the community are starting to take notice of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| that it's really changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| It's not the rural farmland area that they remembered when they were growing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8107)|
| 2:15:12| It's now changing into a lot of subdivisions and commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8112)|
| 2:15:17| And there are challenges with this type of growth that's occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8117)|
| 2:15:21| The scattered growth pattern makes it more difficult to have the ability to pay for capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8121)|
| 2:15:30| because they're stretched over a large area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| So we have more roads and sidewalks that are needed, more parks and greenways and utilities and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8132)|
| 2:15:40| We're reducing the efficiency of our capital expenditures because we are building more to pay less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8140)|
| 2:15:47| This continued rapid growth could potentially outpace the ability for us to pay for new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| or expanded infrastructure or to maintain the infrastructure that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8152)|
| 2:15:57| Also, it has been distracting for creating a sense of place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8157)|
| 2:16:02| and really maintaining these character areas that we have, such as Karnes and Ball Camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8162)|
| 2:16:09| and these smaller communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| Their sense of a small town feel is being disrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8171)|
| 2:16:16| Again, our loss of agricultural land and rural character, as we look to where the future of our food will come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8176)|
| 2:16:23| if we want our food to come from local sources, trying to make sure that we're conserving our agricultural land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8183)|
| 2:16:29| may be something that we want to look at for this sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8189)|
| 2:16:33| because a big portion of this sector is still in a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8193)|
| 2:16:40| These are a summary of some of the comments and observations that we've heard thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8200)|
| 2:16:45| The biggest concern is peak hour and school-related roadway congestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8205)|
| 2:16:50| and then the safety that goes along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| Also, the more attention for sidewalks and greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8213)|
| 2:16:57| There seem to be a number of concerns related to subdivision and sidewalk installation policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8217)|
| 2:17:04| When we choose to recommend where sidewalks should go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8224)|
| 2:17:08| and whether or not that recommendation follows through the plan approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8228)|
| 2:17:12| the community was really interested in sort of knowing exactly what that policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8232)|
| 2:17:18| Hardin Valley Middle School was mentioned very frequently in our survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8238)|
| 2:17:24| The 500 or so responses that we received, probably 80% of those were requesting a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8244)|
| 2:17:31| Hardin Valley and Pellissippi Parkway interchange improvements were also heavily noted in both the public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8251)|
| 2:17:38| and through community comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| The backups that happen, I've been stuck in those a number of times at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8261)|
| 2:17:46| I know that I think the county is looking to do something about those in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8266)|
| 2:17:51| Also, the changing dynamics of tech uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| Seeing sort of an influx of more manufacturing tech uses may be occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| so that would be particularly important for us to conserve some of those flatter land areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| for those heavier intensity uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8284)|
| 2:18:07| Again, looking at this within the technology corridor, particularly because they have good highway access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8287)|
| 2:18:15| and then continuing to look at this mixed-use strategy because we have had a lot of residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8295)|
| 2:18:20| that has gone into the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| and more and more people are wanting to sort of live near where they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8302)|
| 2:18:27| Looking at how we can make these more mixed-use type areas where people would desire to both live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8307)|
| 2:18:33| and work in close proximity to each other could be a strategy for the corridor to make it more appealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8313)|
| 2:18:39| We need to look at possibly reexamining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| and streamlining the TTCDA and MPC project review requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8321)|
| 2:18:46| so we don't have duplicative efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| That might be a way to kind of make the development process a little bit more timely within the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8329)|
| 2:18:55| Also, looking at the Solway area, it doesn't fall under the design guidelines currently for the tech corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8335)|
| 2:19:02| Because of this, it has got some issues with the aesthetics of the area, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8342)|
| 2:19:09| and it is a significant entrance into Knox County from Oak Ridge and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8349)|
| 2:19:17| Looking at perhaps maybe some sort of amended design guidelines for that area is a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8357)|
| 2:19:24| And then also the question of why there have been so many sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8364)|
| 2:19:28| Is our growth plan obsolete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| Is it solely the market-based development decisions that are causing development to happen where it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8371)|
| 2:19:36| And are we not following the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| The new schools as development catalysts, since the growth has been so rapid in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8379)|
| 2:19:45| the impact of the schools is visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| What will that mean for future growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8388)|
| 2:19:51| Also transition from rural to suburban development densities, as well as available utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8391)|
| 2:20:00| These are some of our potential draft plan concepts that we've looked at thus far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| based on some of the comments that we've heard from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| as well as these established growth patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| We're looking to recognize and reinforce some of the unique and distinct character areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8410)|
| 2:20:15| such as downtown Carnes, and perhaps creating a mixed-use center in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8415)|
| 2:20:20| that would help encourage development to maintain that small town feel that residents are familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8420)|
| 2:20:27| Also looking to make the aesthetic improvements in Solway that are needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8427)|
| 2:20:36| so it's not so vastly different from the rest of the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| As well as looking at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8439)|
| 2:20:42| This is a heavy growth center and looking to have a mix of commercial and residential uses in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8442)|
| 2:20:51| that make it a more walkable, bikeable, friendly community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| As well as, again, overall, just attention to the walkability around our schools and in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8455)|
| 2:21:01| We heard that time and time again at meetings from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| that were interested in having the ability to walk to and from places within their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8465)|
| 2:21:13| One way that we could do this to help address some of this dispersed density issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8473)|
| 2:21:18| is to look at some higher density centers that would encourage maximizing these existing infrastructure investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8478)|
| 2:21:27| so that we are building more towards where our roads, our sewer, our water lines are, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8487)|
| 2:21:33| As well as encouraging new public investment in sidewalks and greenways and bike lanes as available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8493)|
| 2:21:43| And then really looking at what our policy is for where sidewalks go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8503)|
| 2:21:47| and how we put those in place and making that a little bit more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8507)|
| 2:21:54| Also, conserving the rural and agricultural character of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8514)|
| 2:21:59| Most of the county sectors, this is a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8519)|
| 2:22:02| In the past, we've talked about and you may have heard about the Conservation Subdivision Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8522)|
| 2:22:07| We have a draft of that that we've been talking about for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8527)|
| 2:22:11| This would allow developers to cluster their development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8531)|
| 2:22:15| and then conserve a large portion of the area for farmland or other rural uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8535)|
| 2:22:21| so they're able to still put their houses in as well as protect some of the farmland capabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8541)|
| 2:22:30| Also, developing more sound environmental policies and plans for the Beaver Creek Watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8550)|
| 2:22:36| This is a continuation of the work that was done for the North County sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8556)|
| 2:22:40| Knox County stormwater has already done a lot within this watershed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8560)|
| 2:22:46| and it's something that we're looking to try to acknowledge within the sector plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8566)|
| 2:22:52| Also, encouraging and supporting the existing farms and agricultural property uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8572)|
| 2:22:58| so future generations can have a place to farm in our county if we so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8578)|
| 2:23:04| If you have any questions, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8584)|
| 2:23:08| I think we started going to meetings in the summer of last year or so on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8588)|
| 2:23:13| This has been a very good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| I think we went to Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| That's another concurrent planning process that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| The Smoky Mountain Greenway Council is looking at the Oak Ridge to West Knoxville Greenway along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8601)|
| 2:23:28| A lot of great ideas are coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8608)|
| 2:23:29| I appreciate the meetings you're having in the public and presenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8609)|
| 2:23:33| I think you've presented to the public three or four times that I know of and I'm sure there's more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8613)|
| 2:23:37| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8617)|
| 2:23:38| Mr. Brantley, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| Well, I was just going to thank Liz personally because she has arranged for her to go some places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8620)|
| 2:23:45| and people have asked for her and she's always been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| and they've always said what a great job she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| So thank you, Liz, very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8629)|
| 2:23:50| It's very helpful to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8630)|
| 2:23:52| And it just shows how fast, you know, over 7,000 housing units in just a few short years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8632)|
| 2:23:59| It's just fantastic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8642)|
| 2:24:03| I just wanted to ask Mr. Hill a question if everybody else is finished on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8643)|
| 2:24:09| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8649)|
| 2:24:10| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8651)|
| 2:24:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| About two and a half years ago, this body asked the MPC to revise the Knox County parking regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8655)|
| 2:24:22| to change the verbiage from 200 square feet parking stall size to 162 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8662)|
| 2:24:30| After two and a half years, are we getting any closer to that process happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8670)|
| 2:24:38| The short answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8678)|
| 2:24:41| A slightly longer answer is that is the project that I inherited when I first came back to MPC in April of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8681)|
| 2:24:49| Now, what has happened is, and I kind of almost jokingly characterized this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8689)|
| 2:24:55| as the citizenry asked for a tire swing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8695)|
| 2:25:00| and here's what it looked like after the legislature got done with it with all the bells and whistles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8700)|
| 2:25:06| MPC kind of did that same thing where a request was entertained to look at the number of variances going to County BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8706)|
| 2:25:17| and all of a sudden there were a bunch of different items that everybody had acknowledged were really not working properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8717)|
| 2:25:26| And so a draft was prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8726)|
| 2:25:30| The city of Knoxville said, we like these ideas as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8730)|
| 2:25:34| and they joined in so that we would have some continuity between city and county zoning requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8734)|
| 2:25:42| And by the time I entered onto the scene, I basically wrote a memo to the two mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8742)|
| 2:25:50| Mayor O'Hara and the county mayor, Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8750)|
| 2:25:54| and said, this is what this project has evolved into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| Do you still want to go forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| And the answer was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8760)|
| 2:26:01| So we're now working with the engineering departments for both city and county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8761)|
| 2:26:08| And one of the aspects I think that looks very promising is we do know that there are going to be some compliance requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8768)|
| 2:26:16| related to TDEC stormwater requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8776)|
| 2:26:23| and they're going to be coming online I think a little bit sooner for the county rather than for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8783)|
| 2:26:30| And having parking lots serve as places where you can store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8790)|
| 2:26:35| and actually allow percolation of water is going to be one of the solutions that we're going to have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8795)|
| 2:26:43| So I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| One of the options we could do is just come back with a very simple ordinance just to take care of the 200-square-foot problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8805)|
| 2:26:53| That's another option that we're considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8813)|
| 2:26:56| Please take that under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8816)|
| 2:26:59| I can tell you that draft ordinances have been prepared and, I mean, in great detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8819)|
| 2:27:06| So they're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8826)|
| 2:27:07| They're being reviewed internally by the city and county administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8827)|
| 2:27:12| I just hope that the MPC realizes what a hardship this is for new businesses that want to relocate to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8832)|
| 2:27:19| and that they have to file with BCA, pay a $200 fine fee, I should say, not fine, excuse me, a fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8839)|
| 2:27:28| wait 30 days, come down to a meeting, wait in line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| and then appear just to get approval for 162 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8851)|
| 2:27:35| And it just seems silly that it's taken this long for MPC to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8855)|
| 2:27:40| What is the largest parking area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8860)|
| 2:27:42| Is it the city or the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| The county has the larger, the 200 square feet, and the city has 162 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8864)|
| 2:27:49| So what happens is everybody that appears before the Board of Zoning Appeals wants to have the same rule apply to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8869)|
| 2:27:55| that they would if they located in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| We obviously want to keep the business to locate in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8878)|
| 2:28:02| And so we go ahead and grant the variance for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| And it just seems silly that it's taken this long to get one line changed in Knox County's parking regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8885)|
| 2:28:12| The one thing I will offer to you, Commissioner, is if through discussions with the county administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8892)|
| 2:28:19| if they would like to make that one single change, we can prepare that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8899)|
| 2:28:23| and divorce that from the rest of the, I guess, more comprehensive amendments being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8903)|
| 2:28:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8910)|
| 2:28:31| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8911)|
| 2:28:33| Any discussion for MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8915)|
| 2:28:36| We're going to move on real quick to discussing the judicial commissioner, where we are in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8916)|
| 2:28:43| Do you want me to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8925)|
| 2:28:46| I think the closing of the applications is March the 9th, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8926)|
| 2:28:52| Is that, do we know what, is it March 9th of the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8932)|
| 2:28:55| It's the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8935)|
| 2:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8939)|
| 2:29:00| The judges, the people who apply to the judges will, to authorize those folks to work in that office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8940)|
| 2:29:05| they want to have first dibs on elimination of people off the list for various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8945)|
| 2:29:13| And then we'll have that by March the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| Have we ever set up the meeting, Julie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| The 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8957)|
| 2:29:19| The 16th at 6 o'clock we'll interview the applicants for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8959)|
| 2:29:24| and then we will pick at the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8964)|
| 2:29:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8968)|
| 2:29:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8969)|
| 2:29:30| And so that's kind of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| And so really there's no reason to, if you can, if you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8972)|
| 2:29:37| but there wouldn't be any reason until after March 9th to meet with folks that if they're not on the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8977)|
| 2:29:42| then they have to be on the judge's approved list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8982)|
| 2:29:45| So we'll get that out to you as soon as we get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8985)|
| 2:29:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8988)|
| 2:29:50| Those two things are the things that are bothering the people that have called me wanting to apply for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8990)|
| 2:29:57| I don't know whether to talk to people or not because the judge's list is not out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| First thing has got to be the judge's list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| If you're not on the judge's list, then you won't even be considered by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9004)|
| 2:30:09| You'll have to quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9009)|
| 2:30:11| Then the second thing is it cannot occur until our selection cannot occur until after the vacancy exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9011)|
| 2:30:20| Am I correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9020)|
| 2:30:21| Is that what you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| Until the vacancy doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| We ran into this the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9026)|
| 2:30:28| When is the vacancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9028)|
| 2:30:29| So it's not until April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| It's April 10th, which is last day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9030)|
| 2:30:32| I think the judges wanted to have somebody ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9032)|
| 2:30:35| They can use their substitutes any way they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9035)|
| 2:30:38| This came up the last time when we were trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| Yep, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9040)|
| 2:30:41| You didn't quit until the day of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9041)|
| 2:30:45| The judges had the same issue the last time they had a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9045)|
| 2:30:51| You can't fill a vacancy until you have a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9051)|
| 2:30:57| They have substitutes and so forth that they can use in this week or two-week period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9057)|
| 2:31:05| They had to go through the same thing, I think, when Mr. Jenkins was appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9065)|
| 2:31:09| So we can't make the appointment in March, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9069)|
| 2:31:12| No, you'll have to make it in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| Unless Mr. Brown changes his date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9076)|
| 2:31:17| And I don't think he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9077)|
| 2:31:18| And I think that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9078)|
| 2:31:19| Was that not true with Mr. Major?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| He changed his date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9082)|
| 2:31:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9083)|
| 2:31:24| To help the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9084)|
| 2:31:26| But what I'm saying is the commission can't fill a vacancy that is not vacant because anything could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9086)|
| 2:31:33| Mr. Brown may decide and they may decide and we could be upside down sideways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9093)|
| 2:31:38| So anyway, it would be your April meeting for your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9098)|
| 2:31:42| You can interview any time you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9102)|
| 2:31:44| I mean, your process can go as any way you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| But your actual vote would be after a vacancy occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9106)|
| 2:31:50| You could have a special call meeting on the 11th and deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9110)|
| 2:31:56| April 10th is his date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9116)|
| 2:31:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9117)|
| 2:31:58| April 10th is his date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9118)|
| 2:31:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9119)|
| 2:32:00| All right, we'll work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9120)|
| 2:32:01| I was under the impression we were going to do a pending approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| The applications are due this Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| So we'll take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9126)|
| 2:32:08| Any other questions before anything else before the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9128)|
| 2:32:11| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9131)|
| 2:32:14| Just a couple of things in regard to the sesquicentennial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9134)|
| 2:32:20| One of the things that the committee is going to do is try to have some shuttle buses because, as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9140)|
| 2:32:26| but if you look through that schedule, a lot of these events are going to be scattered across town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9146)|
| 2:32:30| uptown, downtown, south, east and wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9150)|
| 2:32:35| The bus is going to cost us like 600 bus a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9155)|
| 2:32:39| If anybody has any discretionary funds you'd like to throw into that pot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| the paperwork will be in Jolie's hands within the next hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9163)|
| 2:32:49| So if you do choose to do that, all you've got to do is say, you know, put me down for a couple thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9169)|
| 2:32:57| They'll take all they can get because we want to show Knoxville off, I mean, very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9177)|
| 2:33:04| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9184)|
| 2:33:06| You may want to just mention for our friends who are watching on community TV that our meeting time changes for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9186)|
| 2:33:13| Yes, we do go to the evening meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9193)|
| 2:33:17| The work session will be at four o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9197)|

| 2:33:32| Beer board at four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9212)|
| 2:33:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9214)|
| 2:33:35| Anything else before the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| We're adjourned until five o'clock at zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9217)|
| 2:33:41| Commissioners, let's go ahead and call the meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9221)|

| 2:34:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9244)|
| 2:34:05| We're going to the first one is the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9245)|
| 2:34:08| And then we'll move the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9248)|
| 2:34:09| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9249)|

| 2:34:25| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9265)|
| 2:34:26| I move that we approve the street name change to Anna Mae Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9266)|
| 2:34:33| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9273)|

| 2:34:44| And then we're going to move to 1-E-15-RZ because they're together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9284)|
| 2:34:48| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9288)|
| 2:34:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9289)|
| 2:34:50| The first one is the request of Fraley and Schaling Incorporated for an East County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9290)|
| 2:34:55| from A, Agricultural, to G.C., General Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9295)|

| 2:35:08| Arthur's here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9311)|
| 2:35:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9314)|
| 2:35:17| Scott Davis, opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9317)|
| 2:35:19| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9319)|
| 2:35:22| In light of there not being any opposition, I move that this be approved for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9322)|
| 2:35:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9329)|
| 2:35:30| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9330)|
| 2:35:31| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| Arthur, do you want to earn your keep and tell us what the rest of the commissioners know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| or do you want to leave it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9336)|
| 2:35:40| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9340)|
| 2:35:41| I don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9341)|
| 2:35:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9342)|
| 2:35:43| I sent a memo out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9343)|
| 2:35:45| I don't think Commissioner Thomas got it, but I gave it to him before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9345)|
| 2:35:50| This is to expand an existing truck operation behind the pilot truck stop at Straw Plains Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9350)|
| 2:35:58| hopefully a growing business here in the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9358)|

| 2:36:12| It is 1-E-15-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9372)|

| 2:36:19| to C, B, business and manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9379)|

| 2:36:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9397)|
| 2:36:38| My client advises me they need truck drivers bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9398)|
| 2:36:41| so anybody looking who can pass the drug test don't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9401)|
| 2:36:47| And they're looking for them and seeking to hire a number of new truck drivers this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9407)|
| 2:36:54| It's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9414)|
| 2:36:55| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9415)|
| 2:36:56| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9416)|
| 2:36:57| Is there an age limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9420)|
| 2:37:01| As long as you can get a CDL, a commercial driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9421)|
| 2:37:04| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9424)|
| 2:37:08| Arthur, there was trucks there when I was there looking around the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9428)|
| 2:37:12| and there was too much ice and snow and salt residue hanging on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9432)|
| 2:37:17| So I don't believe you want any of the drivers to be from this motley crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9437)|
| 2:37:24| They lost a lot of them out there on the road, I'm sure, during the past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9444)|
| 2:37:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9448)|
| 2:37:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9449)|

| 2:37:36| for rezoning from A agricultural to PR plan residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9456)|
| 2:37:40| located northwest side of South North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| northeast of Queens Bridge Circle in the 4th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9463)|
| 2:37:48| Is there any applicants here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9470)|
| 2:37:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9472)|
| 2:37:53| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9473)|
| 2:37:54| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9474)|
| 2:37:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9475)|
| 2:37:56| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9476)|
| 2:37:57| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9477)|
| 2:37:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9478)|
| 2:38:00| This is one we just got a last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9480)|
| 2:38:02| If you hadn't checked your e-mail since 4-30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| I might wait until 4-30 on a Monday to send an e-mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9485)|
| 2:38:10| but the lady was questioning the fact of the traffic situation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9490)|
| 2:38:15| Pull your microphone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9495)|
| 2:38:18| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9498)|
| 2:38:19| But she was questioning the traffic situation there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9499)|
| 2:38:25| and, you know, conforming to the rest of the neighborhood part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9505)|
| 2:38:32| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9512)|
| 2:38:33| Was this taken into consideration, Dave, as far as that's concerned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9513)|
| 2:38:38| There was opposition at the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9518)|
| 2:38:41| The concept plan is on for March, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9521)|
| 2:38:45| so we do have a draft of the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9525)|
| 2:38:48| The Knox County Engineering Department actually commissioned a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9528)|
| 2:38:54| for traffic and drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| The results of that are not available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9536)|
| 2:38:58| but the applicant will have to meet those requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9538)|
| 2:39:01| in terms of both site distance on South North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9541)|
| 2:39:05| any kind of improvements needed for turning movements from Knightsbridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9545)|
| 2:39:12| which would be the access point almost across from the villas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9552)|
| 2:39:16| I think is the proposed access point into the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| And then there are some drainage issues right up against South North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9560)|
| 2:39:25| and then a drainage system, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| that goes from a pond that's a little bit further up the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9567)|
| 2:39:31| and feeds down to South North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9571)|
| 2:39:35| So any of those drainage and traffic concerns are going to have to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9575)|
| 2:39:39| during the concept plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9579)|
| 2:39:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9581)|
| 2:39:44| And the motion is to approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9584)|
| 2:39:49| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9589)|
| 2:39:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150223?start=9591)|
