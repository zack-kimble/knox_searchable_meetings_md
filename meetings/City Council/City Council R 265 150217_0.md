| 0:00:00| Okay, good evening. I'll call this meeting to order. This is Knoxville City Council for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| Tuesday, February 17, 2015. I want to thank everybody who came out in this weather tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=6)|
| 0:00:15| for the meeting and also anybody who might be watching from home. We'll start with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=15)|
| 0:00:20| invocation given by Councilman Della Vopi and the Pledge of Allegiance will be led by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=20)|
| 0:00:25| Vice Mayor Pavlos. Heavenly Father, thank you for this opportunity to gather this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=25)|
| 0:00:34| on this cold winter day and serve our city. We are very mindful of people out there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=34)|
| 0:00:42| may have lost their heat and electricity and we know that our utilities are working to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=42)|
| 0:00:47| get them back in shape. We hope people are safe in their homes and not out in freezing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=47)|
| 0:00:53| roadways. We especially ask that you give this body the ability and wisdom to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=53)|
| 0:01:00| and to try to make decisions for the benefit of our city. And, of course, we remember those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=60)|
| 0:01:06| who are less fortunate than ourselves and hope that they are well this evening. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=66)|
| 0:01:11| I salute the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=71)|
| 0:01:21| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=81)|
| 0:01:29| Call the roll, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| I'm going to really push the envelope here tonight. Councilman Grieve, I would ask your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=93)|
| 0:01:41| humble permission, if I could, to move 11P in front of that so we could get the Shriners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=101)|
| 0:01:47| in and out. Just recognize them and let them get out home with their way. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=107)|
| 0:01:55| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| Okay, there's a motion to move 11P before 11A, which is before 9A. All going to be after 8D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=116)|
| 0:02:07| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| I'm not going to say anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| Do we have a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Okay, so all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| Any opposed? Okay, we'll be moving the Shriners up, so just hold on. We'll get to y'all in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| Okay, now anything else to move around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Can we change seats?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Yeah, change seats. Okay, so now is the Mayor's Report. We're on number six, Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| So I first, I want to recognize all the city employees who have been working so hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| prepare for and deal with the winter weather over the past few days. Our Public Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| Department had crews out on city streets and highways starting Sunday morning, putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| down salt brine ahead of the storm to make sure that our roads don't freeze over. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| followed that up with rock salt, and then they were out there with plows over the, once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| the ice and snow actually started. And I know they worked until late last night, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| were back out there at 3 a.m. this morning. At last report, they had put down a total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| of 1,430 tons of rock salt and more than 1,700 gallons of calcium chloride, which helps activate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=187)|
| 0:03:15| the salt at the lower temperatures. That is in addition to the 33,000 gallons of brine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| they put down before the storm. And all of that work paid off. Despite all the ice and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| low temperatures, our primary and secondary roads, our level one and two roads, look really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| good. Many of y'all had to drive them coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| Of course, there are still a lot of bad spots on the lower traffic, on the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| streets that are like level three and beyond. So we definitely caution everyone to still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| take care and to not make any unnecessary trips. Other public service crews have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| out clearing fallen trees and the branches off of roads as the reports have come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| And so far, we've responded to 85 tree calls, at least as of about 5 o'clock this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| And the good news with public service is so far there have been no injuries or accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| so obviously we are very glad about that. We will have multiple crews staying over until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| 11 p.m. tonight, and then we will scale back, assuming that the call volumes decline, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| just our night shift crews. There will be an extra arbor crew and one to two extra salt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| truck crews tonight. Everyone else will then go home for some well-deserved rest and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| prepare for whatever tomorrow throws at us. So at this point, we want folks to get rested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=273)|
| 0:04:40| because that's a very important factor from a safety perspective. You have to get your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| rest in order to do this job right. Also, our police and fire departments, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| want to forget about them. They have also done a great job responding to calls and getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| information out to the public. And I'm going to ask the chief in a minute, each of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| to just report on that. But let me finish my portion of this, which is that CAT kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| the buses running, and I actually saw an email this afternoon from CAT thanking public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| for being out there responding to the roads so that those buses could move. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| they ran as long as they could last night, and they started back up early this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| on limited routes. And we try to keep those going as much as we can, because we know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| critical they are to people in our community. Our 311 call center has been open normal hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| which is basically 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. throughout all of this, fielding calls and getting people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| the help and information they need. Russ Jensen and four of his staff stayed downtown last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| night so they could be here first thing this morning, and several of them are staying again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| tonight to make sure that they can be there at 7 a.m. to answer the phone. Also, by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| way, I've got a few stats. Just today, our 311 office answered 820 calls. That's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=349)|
| 0:05:58| 100 more than average for a Tuesday. And 145 of those were for service requests, 80 were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=358)|
| 0:06:06| about ice and snow issues, and 32 had to do with tree limbs or trees in the street. A lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| of people called about recycling and garbage, was that going to happen today or not. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| apparently a lot of people called about the beer board, too. We had a lot of beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| calls today. So we want to give a great shout out to 311 staff as well. Also, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| communications department, which has been putting out a steady stream of press releases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| tweets, web updates, and Facebook posts to keep the media and the general public informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| about road conditions. A lot of collaboration between police, fire, and public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| getting to communications, we get the word out. We tweeted about road conditions, city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| services, cancellations, and everything else that was going on. And probably some real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| unsung heroes to at least our employees are the two payroll clerks in the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| who actually slept here last night at the city county building so they could finish the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| payroll today and make sure that everybody out there working on the streets is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| going to get paid this week. So I know Jim York will let them know how much we appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| them. So let me now call on Chief Roush and then Deputy Chief Mark Morris to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=435)|
| 0:07:22| police and fire. Thank you, Mayor. Clearly our officers have been out. We've been on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| what we call level 2 of our snow plan, which means we pair our officers up and we put them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| in specific cars for the emergency. And they've been handling the calls. So far, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=453)|
| 0:07:40| today, we had our first collision and that was a tractor trailer backed into a patrol car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| But it was minor damage. No one hurt. Everything's good there. And then we had one near miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| that we've loaded the video up on our Facebook page. But there was an officer working a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| crash on the interstate. A tractor trailer that had jackknifed and was in the median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| Another vehicle coming on the opposite side hit the black ice and came careening across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| and almost hit a TDOT worker, a help truck worker. And it was all captured on video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| Just another warning to people to be very careful. Watch your speed. Black ice is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| very serious and dangerous thing. And it is. And it'll be worse this evening as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| temperature continues to drop. And then one last point is the American Red Cross has set up a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| shelter, emergency shelter, for those who might be out of power and may need somewhere warm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| to sleep for the night. And that's at Park West Church of God at 7635 Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| And so that's set up. And of course, our officers are out trying to help folks as well. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| watch out for the homeless, especially at this time, to get them into shelters at this time as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| well. So a lot of work being done. And so far, everything's fairly safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| Great. Thank you. Deputy Chief Mark Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| And we were on the streets as well. We coordinated with the Knox County 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| And Alan Lawson with that agency opened the emergency operations center at 8 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| yesterday morning. We put together 15 teams in coordination with several other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| agencies that we call tactical response teams. It's two-person teams, an EMT and a paramedic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| that can do welfare checks, first responder type calls. It helps us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| especially on some of the back roads where it's a little more difficult for the fire engines to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| respond to in the bad weather. We had one near miss, as Chief Rouse said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| that I was aware of on the radio yesterday afternoon late. We had an engine 15, I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| was in the Fountain City area around Martha Berry and was briefly stuck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| was able to get themselves out of that difficult situation and actually had a city service truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| come up and put salt down so they could help them, assist them get off that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| We've also had some great coordination in our emergency operations center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| our safety and health and safety officer, Mark Wilbanks, has put in a tremendous amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| helping to dispatch other units besides ours, but including ours in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| We are continuing to keep two of those units in staff tonight in case there are any particular areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| but the EOC for the evening has been shut down. Everything is basically back to normal response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| for all agencies, law enforcement, EMS and fire. Mr. Lawson is wanting to open the EOC again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| briefly in the morning for a three-hour period around rush hour, and that will be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| and then they're contemplating doing that tomorrow or the next day as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| Thank you. Please make sure your folks know how much we appreciate them, what they're doing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| I also want to tell council in front of you the final report from the Urban Land Institute Advisory Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| panel is right there. You remember ULI came to us last October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| and they presented their initial findings at the end of their visit, and this is the more fleshed-out version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| of those recommendations with more background and context. We only have a small number of printed copies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| but we will be putting a PDF of the full report on our website in the morning for everyone to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| We encourage folks in the public to take a look at it as well as council and to give us any kind of reaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| any public feedback. If you go to our website, you'll see the report, and you'll see a link to our email address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=703)|
| 0:11:51| or you can type in ULI at cityofknoxville.org, or you can call into 311,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=711)|
| 0:11:59| and they'll patch you into the Office of Redevelopment if you just want to talk to somebody in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| So please, we want to hear feedback from the community about the ULI report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| And so we're reviewing that right now, and we will have a public meeting on Thursday, March 19th at 5.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=729)|
| 0:12:18| Do we have a location yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| We haven't been able to get people to talk to us about locations. They've been snowed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| People have snowed out, right. So we will be announcing a location, but Thursday, March 19th at 5.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| we anticipate having this public meeting to get feedback on the ULI report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| and start identifying kind of what we see as our priorities as we start to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| Finally, I want to remind everyone once again, we talked about this at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| but the Neighborhood Conference is coming up on Saturday, March 7th at the Knoxville Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=763)|

| 0:12:55| a free continental breakfast and free box lunch, door prizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| and lots of opportunity to connect people with your elected officials, other neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| and neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| There's no charge to participate, but we do ask that you register at the city's website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| at cityofknoxville.org or call 215-2113.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| And that's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| Any reports of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| I've got a couple of events that I wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| First off is the 24th, next Tuesday at 9 a.m., we're going to have the official ribbon-cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=805)|
| 0:13:33| We had an unofficial Dunkin' Donut event with the mayor, myself, Mr. Mayshark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| and some constituents that got out at 7.30 in the morning to come enjoy and meet the new owner there, David Baumgardner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=820)|
| 0:13:48| I know a lot of people think, well, what's he talking about a Dunkin' Donut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| But, I mean, after the bridge closure and what have you, this is one of the more prominent businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| that is located in South Knoxville, and I certainly want to take every opportunity I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| to recognize businesses that, as such, that are so recognizable that are investing in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=842)|
| 0:14:09| So at 9 o'clock, if you're over in South Knoxville and want some great donuts and some good coffee, come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| And then February the 26th, a week from this upcoming Thursday at 6.30, from 6.30 until 8, at Flanagan Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=856)|
| 0:14:28| myself, Commissioner Brown, and School Board Member Amber Roundtree are going to hold a community forum for folks to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=868)|
| 0:14:36| and have at us for an hour and a half, if you will, and just have various questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| It's something that we jointly wanted to do, to have all members of the, you know, excluding state and federal, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| but all the elected members of the respective bodies that, you know, have such an effect on your lives every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| And we just thought it was real important to make ourselves available to our constituents in such a manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=895)|
| 0:15:02| I don't know that it's ever happened in South Knoxville, but I'm glad to be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| Again, it's a week from Thursday, the 26th, Flanagan Landing, from 6.30 to 8. Hope to see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| Thank you, Vice Mayor. Councilman Delgado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Yeah, thank you, Mayor. I just, I was impressed not only by your report about all the service workers in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| and police and fire and everyone that pitched in, and you could see the evidence on the roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| you could see the brining on Sunday, and I just asked my colleagues if we could have a round of applause for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| because they worked overtime and very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=931)|

| 0:16:41| And now we go to 11P, which is a resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| honoring and congratulating the Corbella Shrine Temple on the occasion of its centennial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| Would anyone like to come down and address Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| And they make their way down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| Obviously, you know, they're one of the most charitable organizations that I know of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| and I couldn't even begin to list all the things that they do for our community and for our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| that reside here and all through the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| But it's an iconic building. It sits in the 1st District, which I'm extremely proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| But it's been a landmark in Knoxville for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| I can remember going to winter formals at Central High School. We held them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| We've had such great events as Jack Barnes Christmas luncheon there and just a whole lot of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1045)|
| 0:17:32| So it's been open to the public and thank you all for being here and you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| Good evening. Mayor Rojero, Vice Mayor, City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| My name is George Bovee. I'm at 8400 Old Colony Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| I come here a lot. You all know me. And, Mayor, you've been over to the temple quite a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| I wear a lot of different hats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| This is one of your nicest looking ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| This is one of my favorite hats. That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| It's a pleasure for me to serve as a Public Relations Director at Corbella Temple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| under our potentate, Noble Larry Hubbs, and this is who I want to introduce right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| our great fuzzy hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| We thank you guys for allowing us to come out this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| We are celebrating 100 years of Corbella Temple serving children, crippled children and burned children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| We take care of them at no charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| We send them to the hospital and bring them back from the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| We enjoy that. We enjoy everything we do with the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| That's what we strive for is just for the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| We're having our 100th birthday on the 28th of this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| and we're going to have a meal and some music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| Some of our children are going to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| and we would love for any of you guys that could come by and have a piece of cake with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| Thank you very much for having us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| Thank you so much. Thank you for what you do for our kids, for our whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| I remember going to a lot of South Waterfront planning meetings there at the temple as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| South Knoxville for those, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| All right, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| 11A is a resolution respectfully requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| to study and prepare a small area plan for that portion of North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| from Kingston Pike South to the northern boundary of Sacred Heart Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| possibly becoming an extension of the Bearden Village Opportunities Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| requested by Councilmember Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| Okay, we have a couple of people signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| Let me see if I've got this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| To speak for it is Tom McAdams, and to speak against it is John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| So we'll start with Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| May I say a few words first on that before they speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| Council, you recall that I have another resolution that you folks passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| that had to do with looking at the Bearden area in terms of residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| and I wanted to let my colleagues know that in this particular resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| that what we're asking for is a possibility of having a small area plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| with the possibility of including this particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| into the Bearden Village Opportunities Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| And I want you to know that when we started, when this first came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| I have to admit that this area was kind of under the radar for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| in terms of where it was and what was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| And once we got into it and once we started looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| we realized that there's a whole mixture of different zoning in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| And as the Bearden area grows and as that opportunity plan grows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| we really do need to look at the areas both on the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| and the south side of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| And so this is one of the reasons that I'm asking that this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| be acted upon by City Council so that MPC can go ahead and take a look at the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| And what appears to be one of the major problems that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| is that to look at the area where we have industrial, commercial 3, 4, 5, and 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| we have Office 1, Commercial 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| One of the concerns is the fact that should this area really be zoned C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| which is really a zone that's really for one of the major arterials such as Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| So in reviewing this and talking with a number of different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| and getting a lot of input from different people, the Bearden Council and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| it was felt that maybe this is an area that does need to be looked into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| in terms of a small area plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| It also is an area that leads to one of the major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| or will be one of the major facilities for the city in terms of our park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| I think that by having the study done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| that it will give the opportunity for not only the people in the Bearden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| and also the residential areas around there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| but also give an opportunity to the people who have businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| who have had businesses there who own property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| to be able to give input into what really ought to happen along that area through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| And I think this will give an opportunity for this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| To do this study, it's going to probably be anywhere from six months to a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| once MPC gets started with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| But again, I think we have an opportunity here to look at an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| that is adjacent to the Bearden area, that is near our major park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| and to take a look at really what's best for that area in terms of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| Now, that doesn't mean that those people that are already there cannot continue with what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| And there are certain restraints that a floodplain will allow and not allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| And so, again, those businesses that are there will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| They'll be grandfathered in as we do this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| But I just wanted my council members to understand where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| We've spent a lot of time, I've spent a lot of time in the last couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| not only with Mr. Green, who we'll be talking with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| but also with MPC, the city administration, engineering, codes and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| It's been one that we're not taking lightly in terms of asking for this request for this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| So I just wanted my council members to understand that and to understand where we're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| So we'll hear from the two who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| First, Mr. McAdams, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| State your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Tom McAdams, 1043 Craigland Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| We would urge you to approve this request for a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| and a small area plan for South North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| That's an area that has typically been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| and historically been a neighborhood commercial area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| even though it didn't always fit the existing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| There was originally more industrial zoning in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| but as time changed, it became more of a commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| In recent years, it's continued to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| but it's continued to change to less intensive uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| There's been a great deal of office development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| new office construction, renovation of office buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| There have been new stores go in the area, new restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| a new bank building is under construction across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| and it's typical uses that serve neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| It also is an area that serves as a gateway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| to a lot of important public and private institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| and an area where a lot of investment is occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| including the city and the private sector's investment in Lakeshore Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| excuse me, and the investment in the new Sacred Heart Cathedral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| We recognize that it is difficult for businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| to know exactly what they can and can't do in an F1 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| and it is a challenging zone for many businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| and we recognize that that area is suitable for business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| and should be a neighborhood-type commercial area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| so we are in favor of a study that would support businesses in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| and allow them to continue to prosper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| We think the best way to do that is to study it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| and come up with some arrangement that would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| but that would still preserve the neighborhood character of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Thank you, Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| Mr. King, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| State your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| John King, Corner Market and Church, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1536)|
| 0:25:45| Madam Chair, members of the Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| in keeping with Councilman Greaves' comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| about wanting everybody to know where we are and where we're coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1552)|
| 0:26:00| on behalf of my client, who's got the next item up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| a requested rezoning of some property on South North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| I wanted to say that he didn't initiate the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1569)|
| 0:26:17| He was requested by representatives of the city to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| and it was not a requirement of theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| It was a suggestion, and he has, as a matter of practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| been willing to do pretty much whatever he was asked to do by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| and he's spent a lot of money on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| and some of the things that he did he wouldn't have been required to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| but he did them to make the situation better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| What all that leads to is sort of where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1610)|
| 0:26:59| Ordinarily, it would be his thought to be cooperative, once again, with this study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1619)|
| 0:27:08| but he's cast in the unfortunate posture now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| He can't postpone, he can't table it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1633)|
| 0:27:22| because he's got to have action, as anybody does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| he has to have action by this body within 120 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| of the action of Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| So while he may have been of an attitude to try to be cooperative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| and go along with the suggestion of this study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| he's really in a role where, having requested the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| as a result of conversation with representatives of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| he now can't postpone it and he can't table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| I believe I am correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| I talked to Mr. Swanson about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| and there's no way that we can figure out to get around that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| so we're going to be here for action on our rezoning matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| It's going to be the next item you take up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| and I would hope that action on this resolution doesn't, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1696)|
| 0:28:24| cast the dice from the start with the adoption of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1704)|
| 0:28:34| I don't know anything to say other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| Having said that, I suppose my request would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| that you postpone your request for a study for about 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| and take it up at a council meeting then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| and let me go ahead on my zoning matter next on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Well, let me address this to Mr. King, but really to everyone out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| I see these as two different actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| There was a piece of property that came before us several weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| and was postponed, and I think we're here to act on the merits on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| and I think the fact that Bearden wants to study an area as to its future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| are different things, and I think it's important for us to treat them separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| and I certainly intend to do so, and I urge my colleagues to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| We can't stop the world, but there's nothing wrong in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| with studying for the future and see what our planners think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| is the direction we should be heading in the future decades, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| But Mr. Green has a legitimate request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| and whether it's passed or denied, we should take it up on its merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Obviously I have strong feelings about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| based on my vote on Mr. Green's item on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| and my comments at that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| but Mr. Green since then has retained our law firm to represent him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| and it looks like they've taken a position on this resolution as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| so I'm going to have to abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| Any other comment from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to approve 11A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| the Small Area Plan for South North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| The ayes have it with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| 9A is an ordinance to rezone property located on the east side of South North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| south of Kingston Pike from F1 to C4, Jerry Green Applicant, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1839)|
| 0:30:49| Okay, Council, if there's no motion that you all are ready to do yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| then we do have people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| Speaking for the rezoning is Mr. King, Jerry Green, and Richard Toole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1857)|
| 0:31:06| And then we have two signed up against it, Tom McAdams and Teresa Flame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| So we'll hear first from Mr. King or whatever order you all want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| As you know, everybody has, you get up to three speakers, up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| We will yield and let opposition go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| If that's permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| No, you only get once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| Okay, just trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| Mayor, if I could answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| I really missed you because, you know, you and Mr. Seymour always try to challenge us up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| So go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| I'll ask a quick question, and that is, we had a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| It seemed like neither side wanted one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| Did anything happen during the postponement period, Mr. Greave, or was that just a blaze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1912)|
| 0:32:01| I mean, was there meetings or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| There were a number of meetings, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| It has not sat idle for the last four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| Okay, Mr. King, you've got up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| I'm going to start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Don't start this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Let me get up and hand this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| I didn't have a chance to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Bob, can you grab that, please, and give it to Stephen on the timer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| Can I start the timer now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| In the weather, trying to get me to make copies of stuff is a lost cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| So I only have one set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| I just ask that you review them and then pass them on down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| and ultimately let the city recorder have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| Now we can start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| John King, P.O. Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| As I said before, Mr. Green was asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| I think what happened was a real estate person may have had some interest in the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1983)|
| 0:33:11| and approached a member of council to find out what could be done on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| what type of uses could there be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| and that person was then referred to city codes, and the property was listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2000)|
| 0:33:28| and there was discussion between codes enforcement and my client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| and the come down was it would help cure somewhat of a gray area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| if he would pursue a C-4 rezoning, which is what started this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| There had not been any complaints against his operation on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2024)|
| 0:33:52| and so far as we know there still aren't except for the letter that became a newspaper article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2032)|
| 0:34:04| and I want to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| There's nothing different that has occurred since MPC approved this request 14-0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2046)|
| 0:34:18| and there's really not been a change except for the request for the resolution that you just adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| There hasn't been any change since this matter was before city council on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| and you approved it 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| What happened in the interim period of time was that I believe it was on a Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| before the Tuesday meeting for the second reading there was a letter and opposition surfaced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2077)|
| 0:34:45| and I think what that produced was a lot of misunderstanding or misapprehension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| about what was being done or sought to do there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| and as a consequence we now have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2095)|
| 0:35:04| I would say that it's either my client that operates on that piece of ground or it'll be nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2104)|
| 0:35:22| In the flood zone, if you look at the permitted uses and look at what it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2122)|
| 0:35:33| none of those are going to be undertaken there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| There have been prior instances of landscape usage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| We've had there landscapers, Groovy Susie's, Pope's, Uniquely Nature, Sequoia Landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2144)|
| 0:35:55| Stanley's Greenhouse, and a gentleman who worked on semis in the Quonset Hut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2155)|
| 0:36:03| None of those have been able to be successful there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| and because of the flood zone situation, you can't tear a building down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| and build another one there with any degree of ease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| So I think what we're faced with is it's either the use that he's making of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2180)|
| 0:36:28| or there'll essentially be no use and then it'll be back to being an eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| I think many of you are familiar with what that property looked like before my client leased it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| and cleaned it up and spent money on making it presentable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2200)|
| 0:36:48| Do you have one minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| There's a lot of talk about the neighborhood development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| If you look at your packet of materials that came from MPC, there's a KGIS map in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| It's sort of hard to follow, but if you'll look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| directly across the street from this piece of property is C3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| Directly across the street and immediately southward, a very short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2229)|
| 0:37:17| I mean it's almost directly across from it, there are two lots or two places there that are zoned C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2237)|
| 0:37:27| At the south end of this corridor that we're talking about, on the east side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2247)|
| 0:37:35| same side my client's on, toward the south, there's C4 and C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2255)|
| 0:37:44| They talk about none of the 13 parcels have commercial designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2264)|
| 0:37:51| That's incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| Mr. King, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| I ask that you look at that carefully and approve our rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| I do understand that Mr. Green will have an opportunity to speak, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| Right now, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Mr. Green and then Mr. Toole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Each of them up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Mr. Green, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| Hello, counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Please state your name and address again for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| 1706 Maple Green Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| I'm sorry for this to really get to where it's at right now, but like I said the last time I was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| and like I've said from the very beginning, I don't plan on changing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| As John was talking, I don't know what this study, I went and I started reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| and you know this creek has been studied in 97.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| It was studied in 02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| It was studied in 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| It was studied in 2011, and it's all the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| You can't do nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| It's an F1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| So it's bothersome to waste the taxpayers' money, and you're all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| You know, I've reached out to everybody I could reach out to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| and if somebody won't talk to you, it's very hard to fix the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| But I did get to speak with Father David and talk to him at length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| and a lot of things quietened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| I did speak with Gary Lowe at the Knoxville Republican Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| A lot of that stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| A lot of the homeowner associations, you know, as soon as they were getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| or sending out these mass emails, they were coming straight to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| because I've done so much work for all those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| You know, I've spent a lot of money there just to clean that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| I hope you can see that by those pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| And when you read this letter or this newspaper article that went out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| and calls really what we're here for today, there is C4 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| The only thing that's going to increase traffic is when the new church is built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| right down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| It's going to drastically increase traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| And when Mr. Adams was talking about the different zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| he was talking about North Shore, not South North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| because you can't change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| You know, Mr. Toole is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| Me, him, and Richard Maples own all of South North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| You know, and I just looked over here to see if there's any business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| that is right there in South North Shore that's here tonight to oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| There's not one because they know what kind of person I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| If they need something, my neighbors, they come to me all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| You know, we work good together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| South North Shore, we don't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| I don't know what a study is going to help when you're studying the flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| It's been studied four times, you know, the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| If they were to come and talk to me and sit down with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| I would try anything in the world to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| I think the last time Duane knows I brought you the landscape plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| the very, you know, within the week, you know, I was trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| I think Marshall brought that up about landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| and I went right and had those done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| You know, I was trying to do that and bring them to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| and then this sort of just got out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| You know, I've been there 20 years, and when I started there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| I had a full-time carpenter and a part-time mechanic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| That was the first person I hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| And since then, now we employ seven people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| We plan on doubling if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| You know, it's really where it's at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| And, Duane, I know you've been down there a few times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| and you know exactly what I've got going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| It's nothing special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| I mean, we put people to work, we fix people's cars, and I do sell a few cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| I never once asked for C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| You know, as this all went on, and Peter, I'm sure, will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| you know, I did everything that he asked of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| And then when they asked something, said, you know, you don't have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| but it would be nice, I went ahead and did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| You know, from putting lighted things in on exit ramps, this, that, and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| I don't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| I wished I could create some kind of illusion here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| to make you understand what I'm trying to do, but it is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| It's the same thing I've been doing for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| I plan on asphalt and that whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| I plan on landscaping it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| I took that razor wire chain link fence down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| I cleaned that whole place up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| I hauled off almost 14 30-yard dumpsters, 20-something dump truck loads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| repaired 37 windows, you know, the electric, plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| I could go on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| And, you know, this is a project that I would hope is city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| You understand that either I do that or this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| this place is just a lame property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| And, you know, you get a lot of people that talk about these special things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| and it's all in the paper and this and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| but this is really, if you look, this is my third building I've redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| All I ask, I hope you really, if you look at the facts of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| and I'm not trying to get into anything, but if you look at the facts of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| you can't change South North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| It's in the flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| I ask you to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| You know, 14 to 0 at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| and they went into a deep discussion about what could be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| And if I'm not there, I want you to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Who is going to be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Who's going to take care of that property the way I have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| And I think I've demonstrated that I'm good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| You know, the place right next door, look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| I have zero, absolute zero complaints about anything I've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| and I could go on and on about the people that I do business with every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| you know, large companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| but I just ask for you to do what you did the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| You voted 8 to 1 to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| and I understand Marshall can't vote this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| but, you know, I'm pro-business, I'm a small businessman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| and, you know, really nothing's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| Mr. Toole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| He's not going to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| He's not going to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| So now we have two signed up against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Mr. McAdams and Theresa Flame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2617)|
| 0:43:58| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Tom McAdams, 1043 Craigland Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| This is not about Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| This is about what's an appropriate zoning for South North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| That property has been in the Toole family for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| It's been in productive use for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| It can continue to be in productive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| A used car lot is not the only use of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| The property was rezoned to the F-1 zone in 1983,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| and it has been in the F-1 zone ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| The property adjacent to it is in the F-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| All of the parcels on the east side of South North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| between Kingston Pike and Walden Drive are in the F-1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| Every business over there is in the F-1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| There is C-3 on the west side of South North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| and there's even a couple of C-4 parcels that I hope will be studied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| as part of this small area plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| Those are not used for C-4 uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| Those are used for commercial or for C-3 or C-1 or office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| So there are no C-4 uses in the area, even though there is some C-4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2710)|
| 0:45:18| What really initiated this was not a letter to the editor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| It was the fact that Mr. Green wanted to open a used car lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| and expand its transmission building in a zone where it's not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| And he opened that used car lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| and he opened the transmission business in the Quonset hut in an F-1 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| where it's simply not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| And nobody's gone down and filed a complaint with the codes department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| to shut him down because everybody just hated to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| and thought it was more appropriate that it came when he filed the rezoning application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| than it came before you and was dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| That's the reason that hasn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| There is substantial opposition to this from neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| from neighborhood associations, from businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| Melissa and I live less than a mile from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| Our law firm bought a building one block away and renovated it and moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| The area is improving, and it's on the upswing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| and it's continuing to be a neighborhood commercial and office area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| We think introducing a used car lot is an inappropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| Introducing a mobile home sales center would be an inappropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| Introducing a trailer rental facility would be an inappropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| All of those permitted in a C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Not what Mr. Green plans, but Mr. Green doesn't own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| He has a lease that has no restrictions on use, is freely assignable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| and is freely terminable in 180 days' notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| The maps that you've all seen, that long blue strip down the middle, is the F-1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2807)|
| 0:46:55| He claims there's a lot of C-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| and there is a lot of C-3 on the other side of the street or further away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| but all of that is in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| There are also business in the area that are opposed to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| and Pat Bright, who owns prison pools across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| had planned to speak to you tonight, but he's snowed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| and she said nothing personal to do with Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| He's a good neighbor and has cleaned up the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| I just feel C-4 zoning is inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| because once it's rezoned, there's no going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| He may run a good business, but the next tenant or owner may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| The area has already been improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| Everyone would agree it's neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Virtually everything is a small locally owned business with a neighborhood feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| and a good transition leading to the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| It's her understanding that C-4 is meant for major highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| and South North Shore Drive is not a major highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| We'd give you a package that would file with the city recorder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| that includes the materials that you've already seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| and that have been submitted to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| One of the things it'll show you is that none of the criteria in the city code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| for changing this zoning have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| There are no changes in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| that would require a change in zoning for it to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| In fact, it's changed the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| It's gone more neighborhood commercial and more office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| You have 45 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| There's been no increase in traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| There's a TDOT report included in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| that shows the traffic has been the same for the last 15 years in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| and it will adversely affect other property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2908)|

| 0:48:38| We'd ask you not to make a motion to approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| or if a motion is made to vote against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| and preserve the character of South North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2923)|

| 0:49:09| Teresa Flame, 5524 Heathrow Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| I'm here this evening to represent the Riverbend Peninsula Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| I'm secretary of that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| I'm responsible for all the emails, which, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| I hope all of you have been receiving because we've been trying to get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| We are opposed to this strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| I'd like to speak to what Mr. Green said about there was no opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| and that this passed 14-0 on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| This was one of the things that astonished us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| We found out about this only less than a week before the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| We knew nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| We've done an informal poll of business owners across the street from Mr. Green's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| None of them could remember seeing a sign that said that it was up for rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| and if we had not happened to get an email from Tom McAdams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| we still wouldn't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| Second, his remarks about how we feel this would change the character of the Bearden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| and the Riverbend area, which is a wonderful place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| That's why all of us live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| With the park being improved and the improvements with the cathedral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| we think this is in the wrong direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| I think I'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Our feeling is that this request would not improve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| would not benefit the Bearden area or the Riverbend area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| but it would be solely for the benefit of one person, which is Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| Council, that's the end of our speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| Councilman Dallavope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| I wanted to ask Dan Kelly a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| Those were the only two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| No, there's no rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| No, that's only with appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| Dan, as I read the information we were sent on this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| it seemed to me that originally the used car sale aspect was an accessory to the main use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3076)|
| 0:51:25| a C3 use on doing the transmission work and that type of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| and there was references to state law that said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| if you repair the vehicle and someone doesn't pay the bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| you've got the right to sell it to recoup your labor costs and your material costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| And so it was an incidental or accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| This application seems more like adding sort of a highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| normal highway used car lot unrelated necessarily to the business of repairing transmissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3111)|
| 0:51:58| and sort of being stuck for the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| Could you tell us a little bit about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| and how you view this as a planner when you look at this proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3123)|
| 0:52:11| Council, this matter did come before the planning commission some years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| It was called a use determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| at which time the discussion was that Mr. Green needed to get a dealer's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| in order to be able to sell vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| and he was taking not only ones that he had workman's liens against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| but I think he was also buying some vehicles that were basically inoperative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| and wanted to sell those from that particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| But it was portrayed primarily as this is a sale of the vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| that is certainly secondary to the transmission repair business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| Evidently, Mr. Green has been successful in selling vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| and now wants to expand his business, as all businessmen like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| They like to grow their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| And the property next to it became available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| and he has put vehicles over there that are for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| and they're not necessarily associated with the transmission business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| They're not accessory to that transmission business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| These are vehicles that he's bought with the idea of turning around and just selling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| And that's why he ended up in the process through the city building inspections department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3206)|
| 0:53:35| No longer being accessory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| how do you go about getting in a position where he could legitimately sell vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| from this adjoining property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| And that's how he got into the zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| Let me ask a second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| That is, to understand this F1 flood zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| I mean, I see the picture on the map that shows kind of a dotted line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| that covers sort of a little bit more than a block or two that is around the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| and I guess backflows cover from time to time when it floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| What is the primary goal of this F1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| Is it to keep land clear so that you can dump water on it periodically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| I'm sure Mother Nature can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| You don't do it, but Mother Nature can dump water on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| So buildings sort of exclude storage space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| Tell me how this works and how this fits in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| That's what I'm trying to get at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| The F1 zone and the FEMA regulations are basically in place to minimize damage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| to be able to route flood storm events and minimize damage to structures at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3276)|
| 0:54:44| That's the primary goal of the flood regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| So by using it as a parking lot or a sales lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| he's saying I'm not obstructing the flow of waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| Well, I think that's what the Planning Commission, as you recall, the staff recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3297)|
| 0:55:03| Yeah, the staff was different than the actual commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| The staff recommended a denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| but the Planning Commission opened an eye and looked at Mr. Green's use as basically an open use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3307)|
| 0:55:14| which required the construction of no new buildings or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| So from that standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| they felt that the reuse of this property for the proposed use would be satisfactory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| and therefore recommended the C4 slash F1 zoning to you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| And when I think of car sales, I think of the motor mile and parts of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| Does this area in your planners' view have the suitability for this kind of commercial activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3336)|
| 0:55:43| I mean, I heard talk about neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| I don't know where you draw the line, but just talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| I'm here to not represent the decision of the Planning Commission to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| And, you know, they felt that given the surrounding uses in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3353)|
| 0:56:00| it adjoins the railroad tracks on one side, the creek on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| There are a number of other open type uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| There's a landscaping business across the street or was one at one time that the C4 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3367)|
| 0:56:14| and they listened to Mr. Green's argument that basically he made the same argument before the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| that he made this evening, and they listened to that argument and felt, in their opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| the C4 slash F1 zoning was the most appropriate, was an appropriate zone for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| But we are zoning the piece of land, and his use could change or he could sell it since he doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| or end his lease, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| And I guess the last question or idea is what happens to this property if you don't get C4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3399)|
| 0:56:48| or some use that allows that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| What happens to it in terms of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| Well, there is an existing structure on the property right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| That would remain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| The old Quonset hut that Mr. Green has invested money in to repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| that building is still there and could be used for a C3 type use based on the previous action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3424)|
| 0:57:12| of the building official regarding the use of the property in that area would allow a C3 type use on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3432)|
| 0:57:20| But someone couldn't build like a grocery store or a neighborhood shop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| You can't build there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| So, Dan, a couple more questions to you also then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| But as far as in the F1, you are allowed to have a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| You're allowed to park cars in an F1 on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| So that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| I think that in looking over this in the last four weeks, first of all, I want to commend Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3462)|
| 0:57:50| There's no doubt if you folks, if my colleagues look at the pictures in terms of what he's done to that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| as opposed to what it used to be and the fact that it has cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| And I do think that, as Mr. Green said in talking with codes and zoning folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| he has certainly done everything that he was asked to do, and he was asked about changing the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| I think that from what I understand, the bottom line is that if we rezone this property, C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| then that stays with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| It doesn't matter whether Mr. Green is there or someone else is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| And so C4 is then set not only on the F1 but also within the C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3502)|
| 0:58:29| And I think that's where we really have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| My hope is that there is some way in which we can find a way in which Mr. Green can continue to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| and at the same time with this study that we're looking at to see what it is that we can do in the F1, the C3, and the C4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3519)|
| 0:58:47| in order to look to the future in terms of what is happening in this particular area and along North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3527)|
| 0:58:54| So I think that that's another reason that I'd like to see the study done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| I think that if you look at the plan that you have in front of you there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| and see the mixture of the different zones that are there, and also if you go over into that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| and you see what's happening, as Mr. Adams pointed out, some of the changes that are occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| it seems to me that there ought to be a way in which we can find a compatible uses in the area by looking at what the zone is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3555)|
| 0:59:23| So that's, to me, the bottom line is the C4 is the problem in terms of what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| because if the property does change hands, then whoever gets it next would then be able to fall under the C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| which is not exactly what is wanted in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3575)|
| 0:59:44| Yeah, I guess I'm wondering, and maybe this is for Mr. King, maybe it's for the planner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| but it looked like the city had urged this gentleman to go for C4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3590)|
| 0:59:58| so that he could continue a use that maybe he was doing improperly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| And I don't know if there's a city spokesperson here or whether this is just for the planning commissioner, Mr. King, but I want to know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3603)|
| 1:00:11| Mr. Ahrens is here from our buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| How we got here, it seems like we kicked this ball down the road a bit and now it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| And I just, what's the enforcement view from your perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| Good evening, Peter Ahrens, Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| We didn't necessarily have a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| We had an inquiry as to whether a used car lot is an appropriate use on that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| So we went out, investigated, realized it was in the F1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| It's not an appropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| Had a conversation with Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| He established a preexisting nonconforming use in the Kwanzaa hut as a repair shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3648)|
| 1:00:55| so we granted him that preexisting nonconforming use for that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| He was unable to show that that was a preexisting car dealership or car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| So that's where we said, well, your two choices are you can stop selling cars on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3667)|
| 1:01:15| Because you don't have C4 at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| Because it wasn't, right, it's F1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| On that side of the street, it's all F1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| It's preexisting nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| The uses are associated with C3 versus C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| What was the other choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| The other choice was to go through limited rezoning, which is an option in the F1 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| which would allow a use that's appropriate for the surrounding areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| but not necessarily spelled out in the F1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| And that's the choice that he made, and that's the route that he's taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| So when you looked at it, essentially, the building had a preexisting use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| and that was grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| The rest of it was just vacant land that hadn't been used other than as a floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| Well, you heard there were some other uses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| The landscaping thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| Right, but those were not car dealerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| Not preexisting for car use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| He can continue to work out of the Quonset hut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| And he can continue to park cars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| But he actually sells his cars out of the other building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| I told Mr. Green that the vehicles parked on that parcel cannot be for retail sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| Parked on that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| Council, is there anyone who wishes to call on Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| I'll call on Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| I'll call on Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| Yeah, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| I'll call on Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| Go ahead, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| I want two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| The issue about the car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| A review of the Secretary of State's records reveals that Bobby II, Bobby II Motors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3784)|
| 1:03:11| operated a used car business on the subject site from 1962 through at least 1987.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3791)|
| 1:03:21| There may have been some others after that, but I can't get too clear on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| I can tell you that Resolution Motorsports was on this same property from 1995 through the year 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3805)|
| 1:03:34| and then we have a parade of landscape businesses on it more recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| So clearly there was that use there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| The businesses that are referred to as long-term businesses being there 50 years, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| and they're more in the neighborhood category, well, they grew and flourished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| while Bobby II was selling used cars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| So I'd say that it's not an incompatible use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| The second thing I want to mention, there's concern about C4 and what happens if he's not there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3840)|
| 1:04:09| Somebody else could come and do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| I think you can find by questioning either Mr. Kelly or Mr. Aaron, either one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3852)|
| 1:04:20| trying to rebuild and do something else on that property is virtually, if not totally, impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3860)|
| 1:04:29| But if there's concern about it, my client will commit here and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| that if he ever exercises his option to terminate his lease on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| at the same time he sends that letter of termination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| he will file a rezoning request to take the C4 designation off this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3883)|
| 1:04:51| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| Counsel, is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| Are there any motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3900)|
| 1:05:10| There are no motions, so this dies for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3910)|
| 1:05:17| Move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3917)|

| 1:05:31| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an amendment to an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| with the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| to provide an additional $161,600 in community development block grant funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| for the emergency and minor home repair program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| We have Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| Yeah, just a quick question to Becky Wade, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| and that is it talks about the $77,000 for improving insulation and weathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3961)|
| 1:06:10| and stuff for 30 households, but the figure is $161,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3970)|
| 1:06:18| What's the main difference of usage for the remainder of that money, the $90,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| The only reason that was pointed out, the $77,600,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| was to show that that could be spent by the end of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| The entire amount will be spent by the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| So it will be consumed by then, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Yes, that will be used that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| The rest of it will be spent by the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| Okay, so it's just a timing thing and not a different application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| That helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4013)|

| 1:08:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| Mr. Stanley, we appreciate you being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| Please state your name and address for the record, and I'll start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| My name is Monty Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| I live at 3029 Davenport Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| I just want to speak in support of the acquisition of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| As you all well know, this was the old South High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| It's been on the Fragile 15 list for many years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| It's 12, 13 years that we're trying to find a reuse for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| It is a historic structure, and it could be an asset to the community instead of a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4131)|
| 1:08:58| So we support the acquisition by the city to get this building back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4138)|
| 1:09:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| Thank you, Mr. Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| Mr. Blackburn, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| Rick Blackburn, 4709 Calumet Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| I'm the president of the Board of Directors of Knox Heritage, and on behalf of Knox Heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| we feel that this building has historical integrity and has possibility for redevelopment of new uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| We would support this resolution and hope that we can return this back to our historical fabric and the heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4168)|
| 1:09:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| Thank you, Mr. Blackburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| I'm going to pretty much dovetail off what has been said here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| but there's a couple of other angles to this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| I mean, this is an awesome opportunity for us to address a blighted piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| that sits in the middle of a beautiful neighborhood in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| It's also right next to an elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| and that's all the more reason for this building to be brought back to where it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4201)|
| 1:10:10| I don't know how many of the e-mails that you all got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| but I got quite a few e-mails from folks that graduated from South High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| and like all of us are, we're very proud and would never want to see our former high school demolished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| or even in this state of blight as it sits today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| So it's important to a lot of my constituents in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| There's a lot of love there, and there's thousands of people, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| that went through those halls that would like to see it brought back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| I want to bring back to the point that council was very supportive when we put an H-1 overlay on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| which really saved the building, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| It's given us an opportunity to get to where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| I hate that it's in the state that it is, but we've got an opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4259)|
| 1:11:06| I mean, Knoxville has really, in my mind, done a great job downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4266)|
| 1:11:13| and a lot of structures that are very challenged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| and I'm sure this will be a challenging building to restore, but it's not insurmountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| There's a lot of folks here that will invest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| and I think this is a great opportunity to put it back on the tax rolls, as Mr. Stanley suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4285)|
| 1:11:32| and be an asset to bring new people or existing people or whatever that are in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4292)|
| 1:11:39| or hopefully new people to South Knoxville as a means for folks to have adequate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| very nice housing there in a wonderful neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| So, you know, I hope that you all will support the restoration of this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| put it back on the tax rolls, and remove blight from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| Trump's your side, man. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| Well, I guess a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| I mean, I do support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| It's so unfortunate that this property was sold in this manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| and I assume, and I guess my question, my first question is to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| Since we don't have a copy of the sales contract that he bought or the warranty deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| so there was no clawback provision that if you don't do anything with it, there was nothing mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| I'm sure someone would have told me if there was, so I assume that there's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| and I think Becky can confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| I mean, typically on these sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| It was an auction, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| This building was sold at auction by Knox County, and it was just a deed transferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| No clawback, no particular development needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| And I think when you see other properties that we've even approved a sale of tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| they have clawback provisions in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| If these people that we're selling it to don't do what we ask them to do, we have the right to take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| And that's the unfortunate thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| that the liability gets left on the city of Knoxville to fix a problem, you know, done by somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| And that's really the fuss that I have with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| It should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| It absolutely should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| It's a blighted property, and I know y'all fussed about this before we came on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| I think really the months maybe right before we came on council, y'all were fussing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| I think it's just something as a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| And I guess there's mention in here about the potential of the owner saying he's interested in selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| Is that truth or fact, or is that something that's ongoing, or that he has any interest in negotiating with the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4416)|
| 1:13:44| I can't say for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| I have not spoken with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| And, I mean, I guess attempts have been made to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| I'm just going to finish this side and then come over to this side, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| That's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| We're going to hear from everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| I had my light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| Some people haven't spoken yet, so, you know, we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| Councilman Wallace really took many of my points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| I'm extremely disappointed that nothing has happened to this property over the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| We've had it come back for different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| I'm also concerned, though, about something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| Rule High School is another really nice facility that the county is probably going to surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4466)|
| 1:14:35| and we're going to be in the same situation with Rule High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| I'm going to support this today because I'm really disappointed that this property has not been redeveloped and good things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4479)|
| 1:14:47| But I also think that we need to keep in mind that there will be other properties coming down the pathway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4487)|
| 1:14:55| that we will need to consider what we can do to see that if they go to auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| that something can be done to not let somebody just buy it and sit on it and put other signs in the front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Okay, now, all four of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| Okay, we're going to start here because Mr. Sanders hasn't spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| We're going to work our way up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| Thank you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| Let's arm wrestle and decide which way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| I completely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| I certainly support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| This property has been at play for about eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| and it's outrageous that it's taken us that long to get to a final conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| or at least what I hope is a final conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| I know Knox Heritage has had this on its radar for many, many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| And, in fact, at one point there was a developer who had stepped forward and made an offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| and this thing would now be productive if that had been acted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| but that was the county's process, and here we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| So I very much support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| I understand the caution going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| but there are other properties out there that we're going to have to look at, and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| No, I support this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| I do have a couple of questions that I want to ask Becky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| but, first of all, I want to say that we do have examples in the city right now of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| who have taken some of the old school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| We have Oakwood, and we also have the future of Old City High that are going to be converted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| or Knoxville High, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| And the question that I have, and, Becky, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| I was going to try to get in touch with you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| I hope what we're not doing is praising bad behavior on the part of this developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4595)|
| 1:16:42| because from what I understand, I think he paid, what, $168,000 for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| I think it was closer to $130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| Okay, $130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| And I understand because we're taking it, we do have to have it appraised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| Well, the first step will be to try to negotiate with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| If we have to take it through the court, yes, there is an amount that we have to deposit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| Anything that he owes, county taxes, city taxes, the liens, all that will be deducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| I wanted to be sure that whatever we have spent on this property will come off the sales price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| and come back to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Yes, that's about $55,000 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| Okay, and I do want to say, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| Councilman Starr just mentioned to me that basically the property has been on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| He just hasn't paid any taxes, you know, on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| So, you know, from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| He's never paid taxes, has he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| I think he did some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| I think he quit paying taxes in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| But I also just want to reiterate what Nick had to say about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| the fact that this is a pretty important building right in a wonderful setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| that really can be a benefit to South Knoxville in terms of its location and what can happen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| And so I certainly hope that we can work on it very quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| and that we can continue to look at our situation when we talk about demolition by neglect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| and this sort of thing in terms of what we're working on on that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| You know, in addition to being next to the school, it also backs up to our recreation center as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4694)|
| 1:18:20| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| Thank you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| I think everything has really been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| Because I also wanted to highlight the fact that I think the county learned from this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| and that's why they changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| And for Knoxville High School, they went through a process where they had proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| and they sold it to someone who they felt confident could redevelop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4718)|
| 1:18:45| So I think this was a lesson learned the hard way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| But this is definitely the right move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| and hopefully we can get it into the hands of someone that will actually pay the tax bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| and redevelop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| Becky, I just have really one subject matter type question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| I understood, you know, all the demolition by neglect, the long delays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| not doing the remedial action by this owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| It's obviously something that has to be taken if need be if you can't purchase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| It said in the information sheet that it was going to be marketed through the Homemakers Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4759)|
| 1:19:25| but I'm kind of wondering, does that limit it to, I don't know, a residential apartment use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4765)|
| 1:19:32| or is that the only place that we can place the housing or the structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| Most likely with this building because it's different from our normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| It's not a onesie house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| It's not a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| It's not a lot, the kinds of things we normally deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| This is a large building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| It's a prominent building, and I hope to have some sort of public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| where we can talk about the best use for it and then issue a request for proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4794)|
| 1:20:01| so that we can get developers to come forward to propose exactly what they're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| what their intentions are so we can review their financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| and then certainly have a provision there that we can take the building back if it's not complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4810)|
| 1:20:17| So you're not going to limit yourself to someone who wants to just make apartments or residences of some sort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| You're going to open it up for proposals and find the best use that seems likely to succeed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| Yes, I think that's the best way to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| Well, that's what confused me was the Homemakers Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| and I'm so used to seeing one house at a time type thing, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4838)|

| 1:22:34| Yeah, Mr. Hagerman, I'm having a touch of deja vu here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| Didn't we just do something with this NEO contract where we increase the amount for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4958)|
| 1:22:45| I thought, some other demolition or abatement activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| How is this one different, or how does this fit in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| This is something of a change in scope based on the fact that when we first started into this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4976)|
| 1:23:06| we hadn't decided what all the buildings would be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| This is abatement for some buildings that we have decided to continue using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| Instead of demolishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| But you've got to clean out asbestos or whatever is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| And it is some new work, but the cheapest way to get that work done is to have the people who are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5001)|
| 1:23:33| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| They're already mobilized and present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| What was the prior change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| What did we add before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| I was sitting there thinking, I just thought we authorized this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| There was an ongoing project and things evolved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| There have been several changes for utilities and for other buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5027)|
| 1:23:55| But this specific change is to get a building or buildings we're going to keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| We were able to demolish some extra buildings because we actually had money left that we didn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| We had not anticipated we would have money left over to begin with, so we had a limited scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| We were able to expand that because there were resources available to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| and move the process along a lot quicker than it would have otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| I just want a clarification for what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| Councilman Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| What I was going to ask is, it's my understanding, I wasn't able to talk to Christy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| but it was my understanding that the original demolition budget came in under the budget, I mean the actual cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5066)|
| 1:24:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| And it's my understanding we're still under the budget for the amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| We're still within the original budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| So it's important that we're still under what was budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| And that's my point as well, and I'm sorry I didn't get this question asked today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| because it ties in with Kay coming up right behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| Would it just be possible to get just an update on where we are on the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| what we've set aside for the budget coming up with the next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| And, you know, as long as we're staying under budget and within budget, that's like an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| I don't have to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| That'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| Why don't we put that together and email it to them after council, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| That'd be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5112)|

| 1:25:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5115)|

| 1:26:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| I don't think Rick is here, is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| No, Dr. Lyons can take this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| I don't have a problem with this, but I just want to say that this is one way that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| take care of a situation on Market Square that has needed to be taken care of for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| But I just hope that we don't send out the message that we're allowing bad behavior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5191)|
| 1:26:38| continue to where the city then steps in, because here's a situation where we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| a building that this individual, the owners of the building, a long time ago, they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| owned these buildings forever, and everything around them has improved and fixed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| And so now the city is stepping in, which I'm glad they are, because it's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| that we'll take over the storefronts and we'll take over a portion of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| We'll take the plywood down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| And so as long as we're there and storing the equipment in there, at least we're fixing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| But I just want to make the point that to let other people know that we're not trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| to celebrate bad behavior on the part of a citizen who should have taken care of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| property a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150217?start=5237)|
