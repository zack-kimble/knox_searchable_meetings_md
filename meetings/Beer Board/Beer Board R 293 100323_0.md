| 0:07:31| So the permit is only being asked for the three owners listed on this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| No further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Not seeing any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| All those in favor of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| We don't have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| We didn't hear from Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| We're waiting on the building inspector's approval and health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| I'll make a motion to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| There's a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| Those no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Remedies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=487)|
| 0:08:15| Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| I'm Darryl Brown, home address 5640 Magazine Road, business address 5903 Chapman Highway, 37920 for both of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=498)|
| 0:08:26| South Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| I have an incomplete application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| I'm not sure if Ms. Martin got an updated one on the criminal history on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| It wasn't completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| Do you have an updated one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| It is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| And we're waiting on health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| Counselwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Officer Husky, I see this incomplete on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| With the information that's in the packet, does that complete what you would need to know about the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| I just need to look at it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Just the question of have you been charged with certain things, and it wasn't filled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| And I picked up the packet early from Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| Well, instead of having you do that, I have a second question to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| You and I had an e-mail conversation today regarding this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| and the pending pre-hearing conference that's coming up with the previous permit owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| and I have some concerns about approval of this when that's pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| Could you speak to that a little bit, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| Concerning two or three violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| we had asked the law department to file a noncompliance complaint with the current permit holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| which was filed with a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| The date was set, and it was actually requested by the current permit holder to be put off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| It is set for March 31st for a pre-conference hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| So we are currently in a hearing process with the current permit holder, which is the Double D Saloon and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=602)|
| 0:10:12| It would seem prudent in this case to allow that hearing process to play out before we look at issuing another permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=612)|
| 0:10:20| Do you anticipate that this process might be completed by the April beer board meeting, or would it be until May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| It would be, that depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| It could be up to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| Once the pre-hearing conference takes place on the 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| they would have the opportunity to work something out with our law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| and if they could work something out, it could be completed quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| It just depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| I'm going to make a motion to postpone to the April meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| but I don't want to curtail any discussion that Mr. Bailey might have that's not germane to the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| So I'll hold off on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| I had a question about, in terms of being new on the beer board here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| that we're looking just at the applicant for the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=661)|
| 0:11:08| not necessarily what might have happened at the place prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| In other words, apparently there's been some violations in the past with the existing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| But how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| I'm just educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| If you look at each application on its own merits, each applicant on their own merits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| and so unless there has been a revocation of a permit at a previous location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=688)|
| 0:11:36| there's a statute that provides that if a permit is revoked at a particular location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| then you have the option of deciding whether or not you want there to be no permit there for a year thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=702)|
| 0:11:52| To this point, the beer board has always elected to allow someone who is not related to a previous owner who is revoked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=712)|
| 0:12:01| to have a beer permit at the same location where the revocation occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| but have always conditioned it upon being no relationship between previous ownership and current ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| Is there a relationship between the previous and the present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| There is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| That's my stepfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| I know this is in the first district, your district, and I know you've looked into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| but I was going to ask Mr. Swanson, if I may, does that relationship, does that matter to us that they're related?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=749)|
| 0:12:40| At this stage of the game, there has been no revocation, so it's not an issue for you at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Can you clarify what we're here to look at, what we're here to decide on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| You're here as a beer board to determine whether or not they qualify for a beer permit under all of the usual qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=772)|
| 0:13:01| that everyone has to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| Ms. Date, would you repeat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| We're waiting on health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| Let me ask, I mean, why don't you, I mean, you and I had a long conversation today about the situation there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| and I think that it would be appropriate for you to share, you know, you see how this is playing out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| I think it's appropriate for you to share to this board the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| I had made copies for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| If it's all right to bring them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| You can give them to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| I'll get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Just hand me the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| We'll hand them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| I got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| You got one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=828)|
| 0:13:58| What it is is my stepfather has become really ill, and a few weeks ago I seen him be put in a coma three times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=838)|
| 0:14:09| and he basically is not in the mind to run the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| He was going to get rid of the business before the things that even happened, happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=856)|
| 0:14:23| As far as the past year has went, there's a bunch of stuff in here stating, you know, how he is disabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| and the hospital admissions, how he has applied for social security benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=871)|
| 0:14:38| the doctor saying that he is disabled, that his brain and neurologically he's not really focused to be able to do it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=878)|
| 0:14:52| And I feel that I could run it the correct way, the way it's supposed to be run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| So I feel if anybody was entitled to have a shot at it, that it should be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| I mean, everything kind of explains itself through, you know, you got your exhibits, it says on the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| and you can read through them, you know, basically his mind is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| And it shows that they didn't even gross, they didn't even make profit last year at all, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=915)|
| 0:15:22| So there we're going to close it before anything ever happened anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=922)|
| 0:15:32| I don't know what much more to say, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| Thank you, Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| Officer Husky, I wonder if you could address, I guess my, I have a great deal of sympathy for what's happened in your family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=941)|
| 0:15:49| and I'm sincerely sorry for your father-in-law and his illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| My concern is that our beer board tries to avoid setting precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| And as Mr. Swanson said, you know, treats all the businesses the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| And my concern is if a business has some violations pending and then changes the ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=964)|
| 0:16:13| then that sort of circumvents the hearing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| Would that be a correct conclusion, Officer Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| If the permit changes, then the hearing no longer happens with the previous owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| In this case, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| And, you know, I think in your case, obviously you have a great reason to take over running the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| but I feel like, you know, in the future we don't want to have the situation where an irresponsible business owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=995)|
| 0:16:43| which I'm sure your father-in-law was not, you know, has some violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| and then changes the business ownership and somehow avoids the system that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| that is supposed to play out to ensure that we have responsible permit holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| So that was the reason why I was going to ask for the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| so that this original process could play out and then we could approve the change in ownership at a future meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1021)|
| 0:17:10| If I could, and I'll recognize you, what would happen, I mean, how's the business operating now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| They're operating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| When I step in, it's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| I have nothing to do with what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| I have my own ideas, you know, and I want it perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| If you look also in here, there's a statement that says that he has another business, which was D&J Painting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1046)|
| 0:17:34| He had a painting company and he is also called to have the license dismissed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| and he is also closing that business as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| So it's not just this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| He is not capable of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| It's not a thing to where, okay, we're just going to switch or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| It was going to close down and I think that I could do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| I think that, you know, as far as business goes, you can be hard-nosed and tight and run it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1077)|
| 0:18:06| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| My goal would be to, you know, I know that you have these operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| My goal, what I would think in mind is your operators would go or your people who are inspectors would go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| okay, so we're going to go to Double D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| We're not going to find anything, but it's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| We're going there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| And I want that in their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| That's how clean I want it running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| Councilman Gregg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| I was just going to ask the officer, what were the violations that are under investigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| There was a gambling device and Zelda underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| I guess I want to follow up a little on what happens if we go either way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| because I think Ms. Roddy has a good point about us not encouraging allowing any cracks in that wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1122)|
| 0:18:53| If we say, and I guess just to start out, are you ready to open tomorrow as remedies if we grant this now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| or are you still a ways away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| As far as I know, I have 90 days for the permit to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| There's still some things that have to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| They have to have, if it was to be passed and as soon as it did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| I have to have the health people come out and inspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| and then it would have to be turned in to where I could actually have the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| So you've got a little while to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| One possibility might be to do, since the hearing is now set for the end of this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| we could put this off for two weeks and have a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| Because I appreciate where you're at and I want to be supportive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| but I think Ms. Roddy is right if there's a way to say let's not open up any crack that allows somebody to get around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| and that sounds possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| And I appreciate you being open for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| I'm wondering if my colleagues who might support this would tell me what would they expect to happen at that hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1194)|
| 0:20:03| and what different scenarios could happen at that hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| Because they're going to get out of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| And so I'm just wondering what their fate would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| Would they be tried and convicted or tried and what would be the outcome and then what would we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1214)|
| 0:20:23| I feel like that's a question for Officer Huskey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| She had her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| I'm going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| I'm just wondering what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| I can try and answer Mr. Bailey's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| Well, Ms. Roddy, I want to recognize her because I think she had her lie down first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| Well, we've got discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| Mr. Bailey wanted a question answered and I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| I would think maybe Officer Huskey could address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| I was going to make a motion to postpone when the discussion had come to a logical conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| And I thought I didn't see any more lights and then I saw Mr. Bailey's light, so I'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| So, well, Vice Mayor Becker had his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| Well, I guess if Mr. Husker and Mr. Swanson want to jump in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| my sense is that at some point your father-in-law is giving up his bureau permit, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| That's my stepfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| Stepfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| So at some point what I actually expect is at some point we're coming back here and there is all this hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| the double D no longer exists, no longer has a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| and we've done what I think Ms. Roddy is getting at is a real clear, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| we don't allow somebody to dance around a hearing by getting another permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| I don't think anything else happens at that hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| Mr. Husker and Mr. Swanson might have disagreements, but I don't think there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1299)|
| 0:21:48| Mr. Huskey, I guess I'm going to go back to Mr. Swanson again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| is that are we concerned because there's a relationship between a family member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1313)|
| 0:22:00| and I'm going back to what you said earlier about what we have to do is just look at the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| I mean, if I were to go, let's say Councilman Bailey had a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| and he was in violation of a number of things and I go in to take over his business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| would I have to go through the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| Would I have to wait until he was cleared for me to take over a business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| I think I understand what you said, and the answer to that would probably be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| If a previous permit is revoked, then Council would have to waive the statutory provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1353)|
| 0:22:41| that says you can't have a new permit there for a year unless you choose to waive that provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| So there would be a decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| At this stage of the process, there is no decision to make because there's been no revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| Has that business, have they had that done to them before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| I mean, would this be the first time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| This business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| I am unaware of it happening there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| But again, so just to be clear, we're supposed to look at the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| and the individual that's before us in terms of the permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Even though he doesn't have it on, you have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| Councilman Greaves, that's kind of where I've always been, and we've had different scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| where it might appear that someone related, not kinship, but would come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| and they would try to flip the permit over to someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| but it would really be the same people operating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| And I understand that, but that was my line of questioning both to Mr. Swanson and Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1416)|
| 0:23:43| What are we here to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| We're here to look to see if the applicant feels that is what he's supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| And then I asked Ms. Day, and I guess he has the health permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| And so I think I'm obligated to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| Chairman, I think I must have done a singularly poor job of conveying to the VIER board tonight what my concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| I have no concern about the fact that the applicant and the prior applicant are related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| I really don't have a concern about how the hearing comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| My concern is procedural and that this board not circumvent the hearing procedure that we have set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1454)|
| 0:24:22| to address permit holders who are in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| And that by issuing this new permit, whether to this gentleman or to anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| suddenly that hearing system just drops off the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| Those previous violations just kind of become erased and go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| And in my mind, that circumvents our process and sets a poor precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| So I have a question for Officer Huskey before I make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| Officer Huskey, did you have a chance to review the information from the VIER permit office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| regarding the incomplete part of this application while we were talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| And you're all okay with that? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| And my thought was to what I plan to do now is make a motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| to the next regularly scheduled VIER board meeting in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| And then at that time, if the hearing process has not played out, we can certainly discuss this further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| But there is at least a pre-hearing on the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| Officer Huskey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| And maybe I can just explain briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Our concern would be is generally what happens with a hearing like this generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| I can't say for this particular place, is there would be some type of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| we would ask for some type of fine or suspension for that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| Obviously, if they're granted a new permit, that's not going to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| because there's currently, that old permit will be gone and it's a clean slate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| But our concern is the future, if you have a place that has several violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| and we file for a hearing, that they could just swap it off to someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| and then that walks them clean if they don't show up at a hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| they don't want to go through the process, there's not a whole lot you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| And if they move to go open up another place, they start a clean slate again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| It's just that was our concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Not necessarily this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| I'm concerned about setting a precedent going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| and I know some members of this board dealt with a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| where there were some very egregious violations on a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| And as Mr. Swanson reminded us, unless there's a revocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| we don't have the ability to deny a permit at a particular physical location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| that has been a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Not this one, but we have had some in the past in various parts of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| that have been tremendously difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| And if the hearing revocation process does not go forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| and that revocation doesn't take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| then we don't have that option that Mr. Swanson talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| that we can take or not take to deny a permit at that location for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| Is that right, Officer Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| What we generally do is if we went on with this hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| which we could still go on with the hearing even if you grant this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| versus the old permit holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| is we generally ask for it to be revoked because they don't show up to the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| and the hearing officer revokes the old permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| That's kind of how that happens too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| So it's either a suspension, a fine, or it gets revoked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| or it gets dropped altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| So there's different outcomes that it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| And I guess those are the steps and the system that I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| are a very important safeguard for us in how we issue beer permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| that is my concern in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| So I would like to make a motion to postpone to the next regularly scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| beer board meeting in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| That's a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| There's further discussion by Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Not to this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| I want to amend it to make it a postponement for two weeks until April 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| and we hold a special meeting then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Then if you'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| This is on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Go ahead and call the roll on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| Well, this is to change it to a two-week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| and then we'd still have to vote on the two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| So we're not voting on the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| We're just voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| Sure, I'll accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| If we can do it that way, that's easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| So it's now a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Can I have clarification on what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| We're voting on whether or not to postpone this issue for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1717)|

| 0:29:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| So it's a four-to-three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| It will be postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| So be back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1745)|

| 0:32:23| Call is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| You all remember we deferred this from the February 23rd meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| There was a lot of questions about not particularly the applicants or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| but just about the appropriateness, I guess, of a beer permit being given to this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| So I would assume everybody has done their diligence and had time to go out and look it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1960)|
| 0:32:48| Martin, did I ask you if we were ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| Did I forget you again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| I guess I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| I just wanted to make sure I didn't forget you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Call is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| Is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| I did go out and visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Thank you, Mr. Masters, for hosting me and answering my questions that afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| I have not changed my mind about this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| I think the first-team program that you all have built at the WE course at Williams Creek is incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=1995)|
| 0:33:22| I think the cooperation with the city of Knoxville at that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| and the use of the adaptive center for an after-school program gives a lot of children an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| that they probably wouldn't have otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| I'm impressed with the programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| I'm impressed with the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| I spent some time looking at the materials that you sent me home with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| The values that are espoused by this program, I think, are exactly what we want youth sports to teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2021)|
| 0:33:49| My problem with this permit is I don't see a place for alcohol mixed in with youth sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| And as I explained to you, when I was out of the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| I think that a special event permit that would allow beer sales as a part of tournaments at certain times of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2038)|
| 0:34:07| and maybe the course could be closed to youth play on those days might allow for the revenue that you all seek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2047)|
| 0:34:15| to help underwrite the first-team programming without having beer sales out of the pro shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| One of the opportunities for youth that I learned about in your materials is that as young people progress through this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2061)|
| 0:34:30| they have the opportunity to work at the golf course and learn the responsibility of holding a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| and management of a course and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| And, you know, that concerns me, that those young people would then be in the pro shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| where beer is available and accessible and being sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| And I just can't reconcile that at a city recreational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| So I cannot support this permit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| Well, this is in my district and in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| And as I understand the Wii course, the original intent of it was for inner city youth to learn the game of golf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2102)|
| 0:35:11| and build character and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| I'm very respectful of the board of directors and those who are running the Wii course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| However, I think that these young people need an oasis, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| of some place that they can go where there is no beer sales because we have an abundance of that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2128)|
| 0:35:36| So I'm not going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| Last, Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| Yeah, just to answer a real quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| I know this is something we said a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| but what percentage of the people who use the Wii course are actually kids in sort of the best you can tell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2147)|
| 0:35:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| The people that come and play the Wii course, it's 95% adult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| And, guys, I do want to say, and especially to what you said, Ms. Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| if you look at the other public facilities at the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| Well, hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| I'll give you a sec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| Councilwoman Palmer had her light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| Let's get her and then I'll come right back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| As this came about in our last beer board meeting, I wanted to find out how the county handled their golf courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2176)|
| 0:36:24| As I understand it, they had two junior golf courses, and to play at those courses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| you had to have a child with you or a youngster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| That has been phased out by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| I understand that the First Tee program is a program that is offered at the Williams Creek golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2197)|
| 0:36:46| I, too, went out and talked with people there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| and I understand that there may be consideration for a name change to the Par 3 golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| I was very satisfied that there was a separation of the youth activities and the youth access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2215)|
| 0:37:02| and the way the beer would be locked or protected so that it would not be out and about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| So I will be supporting this application tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Ms. Roddy, may I recognize Mr. Masters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| I just wanted to make a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| If you look at the other public facilities here around our golf course, around our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| you've got Three Ridges, Whittles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| There are other youth programs at those facilities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| There are other kids that work there at those facilities that have access to it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| So we're not an enigma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| We do give them opportunities to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| but that would be in a controlled environment just like at those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| And that's just the point I wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Mr. Masters, I appreciate your passion for selling beer at the Wii course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| However, I don't share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| And, you know, in looking through, again, through your annual report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| one of the things that I recall and that is stated in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| is that a lot of fundraising has gone into raising money for this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| to start a first tee program in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| And I'm concerned that we be true to the vision and the mission of this course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| as was conveyed to the founders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| There's a founders club in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| There are annual donors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| There are fifth-year anniversary donors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| And my understanding is that many of these individuals have been told about the mission of the first tee program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2309)|
| 0:38:37| and what that does for developing leadership in, as Mr. Brown said, inner-city youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| And I just don't think this decision is true to that legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| Councilman Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| Yes, I'd like to see whether or not Mr. Bush would like to come up and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| It was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| I talked to both him and several other people about kind of the history of what's happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| from the time they started the program to where they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| And I think, Mr. Bush, if you could share that, you know, maybe with the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| in terms of how things have changed over the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| I'm Jim Bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| I reside at 6208 Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| When we started this facility 10 years ago, our objective was twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| One, to have a program for the children, the young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| And the other one was to have a quality golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| And the purpose of the golf course was to help us raise funds so that we could run a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| The program is extremely important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| The golf course helps us to afford to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| And beer sales on a golf course, it's 96 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| You've got, at most, 18 foursomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| And that adds up to not many people per square foot at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| And when they're spread out like they are, we do not have a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| We do not have a location in the clubhouse itself that we will promote people sitting and drinking beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2409)|
| 0:40:21| unless it is a special event when children will not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| We are as concerned about the program as Ms. Roddy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| We are as concerned about the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| But we also are concerned about the ability to make it happen in an atmosphere that we can afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2438)|
| 0:40:45| and that we can do properly to help the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| Now, we don't intend to allow irresponsible use of the beer that we intend to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2453)|
| 0:41:04| And right now we have many of the people that come to play, they bring their own cooler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| And we're finding all sorts of empty beer cans and beer bottles on the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2471)|
| 0:41:18| And we feel that if we sell it, we better can control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| That's the reason we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| We are here for both entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| The First Tee Program, which is extremely important to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| and the proper operation of a golf course that enables us to run a profit and not lose money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2492)|
| 0:41:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Councilman Bailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| Mr. Bush, I want to ask you something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| I'm on the board there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| Can you kind of explain the name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| What is the current status of the name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| I know we're working on this relationship with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| But for the longest time, there's been a number of people that have felt like in terms of what this golf course really is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2523)|
| 0:42:13| that there should be a name change, which is Williams Creek Golf Course, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| Councilman Bailing, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| We started out with it as a we course because in Scotland, we has to do with a lot of different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| and that's where the game of golf came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| We right now are working to establish three walking holes for the kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| similar to what's at Concord and Beverly Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| And this will more divide what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| And the thought process is these three, four holes that we will develop will be our we course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| Williams Creek Golf Course will be adjacent to it and separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| That's how the name came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| When you have a we breeze in Scotland, it's not a we breeze according to what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| How many members on the board are directors on the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| We have 18, 19 members on our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| Have you discussed this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Have you discussed this application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Oh, yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| I know there's a lot of very respected, responsible members of that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2602)|
| 0:43:30| And I just want to also, I know those of you who have been out there, that's not a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| It's not a place to sit around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| It would just be purchased like every other golf course and taken out on the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| And it's already something that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| So it's a matter of really more control, not less control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| And I don't recall but maybe one instance in the entire history of the golf course unrelated to alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2631)|
| 0:43:59| but there's probably one problem that I've ever heard of that occurred out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| So there are no problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| And I know this is, I appreciate Councilman Roddy, but here again, I think there's a lot of responsible oversight here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2647)|
| 0:44:15| It's something that I know they take seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| And the truth is the file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| And I think we're legally required to allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| Thank you, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| I have a question for both Mr. Bush again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| I appreciate what Councilman Bailey is saying and also what Councilman Roddy has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| It seems to me that one question that comes up, are you going to allow people to bring their own coolers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| No, we will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Once we have it, we will have control of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| Well, I think that since you folks were here the last time and are here this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| that you really fully understand the concerns of what the Council and the Beer Board has in terms of the youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| And that personally I like the idea that it's going to be more controlled under this situation than what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| And I think also I think we need to be realistic that all the other golf courses serve alcohol of some kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| We take our children to restaurants and we come downtown and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| And I think that knowing how this Council really feels about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| I think that we'll look to you folks to really have strong control over what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| I also know in having discussions with you that this has not been an easy decision by the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| And other Board members that I've talked to also have really wrestled with this particular problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| But I am going to support the measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| And if I could from the Chair, I mean, it is a tough issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| And I think Councilwoman Roddy makes a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| But I've been in and around the golf community in Knoxville for over 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| And I don't know of one other than maybe Pine Lakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| And I'll probably get ten phone calls tonight that don't serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| And I haven't seen the problems that we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| And I think it's valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| But like Councilman Grieve, I think the control of it rather than people sneaking on a cooler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| and perhaps who knows what happens when you don't know where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| makes me want to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| Plus the fact that it's just like the gentleman that was up here from remedies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| I mean, we would be setting a precedent since I've been Chair of this Board that if they met the qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2799)|
| 0:46:47| I don't know how we could just deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| So I am going to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| I don't think we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| We do have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Oh, we do have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Sorry, we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| If you'll call the roll, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Chairman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2842)|

| 0:47:33| It's a special place in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| We do have policies and procedures set in place that will very much control what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2862)|

| 0:47:45| Aisle 9, did they get here this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| We received a request by telephone before the meeting, and I'm sorry I didn't get this in earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| They want to be deferred, so I would recommend you defer them until April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Deferred until?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| April 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| If there's a motion, is there a discussion on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| I guess there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| Is there a discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Now our most favorite time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Yes, indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| We've got some new information to discuss this evening, and Ms. Martin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| if you'll kind of walk this new board through some of this additional procedure this evening, I'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2905)|
| 0:48:32| I'm going to try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| Item A in your addendum, the beer permittees with delinquent gross receipts taxes, is an attachment to your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2915)|
| 0:48:45| What this means is these folks have not paid their gross receipts tax, which is related to their business license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2925)|
| 0:48:53| which means they don't have a valid business license, and that puts the beer permit in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2933)|
| 0:49:00| So this is presented for your information, and it is up to you what you do about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| if you wanted to invite them down to talk about it or if you wanted to take action to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| And all these have been given certified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| They have been given ample time, and we sent them certified mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| Did they get this letter that says across the top, revocation of beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| That's why it's on there for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| And did any of them respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| We had responses from quite a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| What you're being told is the ones who didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| Do we have any on this list who have not paid yet but called and said, you know, I've got to wait for X to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2977)|
| 0:49:47| Well, unfortunately, we could have a left-hand and right-hand problem because Ms. Day doesn't get the calls necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2987)|
| 0:49:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| That's good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| So what's the Board's pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| I would recommend that we bring them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| Third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| And I guess is your pleasure, Mr. Chairman, that they come down to pay us or they come down whether they've paid or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3015)|
| 0:50:27| Well, I would, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| I think that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| I mean, it almost, my gut just says they should come down here even if they have paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| But, I mean, if they have not paid out of now, have not responded to this letter, I want to see them at that podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| Could I make a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| What we have done in the past and what seems to work very well with regard to this is simply move, to send them all to suspension or revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3045)|
| 0:50:53| Notice goes out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| It either gets paid or it doesn't or it goes to suspension or revocation hearing and you don't have to mess with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| I think you have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| Do you want to withdraw that and I'll make a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| So substitute to do what Mr. Swanson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| I'll withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Is there further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Second item, under A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| It's much the same thing, only this is related to the $100 annual beer privilege tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| And the folks who are brought to you tonight are in the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| They haven't paid their tax and their beer permit is at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3098)|
| 0:51:47| I don't see how this would be different from what we just, I'm sorry, Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| No, please, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| I don't see how this would be different than what we just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| So I'll make the motion that we go ahead and send them the same revocation that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Opposed, like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| And then we have one more item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| One more item that I think will be easy to dispense with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| We have tried through various ways to reach these folks, and the mail has returned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3135)|
| 0:52:23| and they don't answer phone calls, and they're not responsive, and we believe this should die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3143)|
| 0:52:30| So if you don't do anything, it dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| We are ordering flowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| I wouldn't even order flowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| Hearing no motion, I believe that one is going to the funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| Is there any other further business to come before this beer board tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| If not, I will entertain a motion for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-board-r-293-100323?start=3169)|
