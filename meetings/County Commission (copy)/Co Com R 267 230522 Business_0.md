| 0:05:13| I see Director Holden is approaching the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=313.0)|
| 0:05:21| Jenny Holden, 400 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=321.0)|
| 0:05:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=323.0)|
| 0:05:24| I appreciate the opportunity to introduce one of my newest team members, the Director of our Public Safety Division, Brent Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=324.0)|
| 0:05:34| He's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=334.0)|
| 0:05:35| Brent is, he retired as an Assistant Chief from the Knoxville Fire Department after 27 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=335.0)|
| 0:05:41| He is an Air Force veteran and is one of only three fire professionals here in the city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=341.0)|
| 0:05:48| that has completed the National Fire Academy's Executive Fire Officer Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=348.0)|
| 0:05:54| We are thrilled to have him here in his new position here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=354.0)|
| 0:05:58| He's overseeing our Homeland Security Programs as well as our Fire and Rescue Programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=358.0)|
| 0:06:02| The Mayor's Office has asked our department to provide you all an update on a quarterly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=362.0)|
| 0:06:08| on our Fire and Rescue Programs, and Brent's going to be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=368.0)|
| 0:06:12| He's going to start in July, so we wanted to give you all an opportunity to meet him tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=372.0)|

| 0:06:24| With no further ado, this is Brent Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=384.0)|
| 0:06:27| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=387.0)|
| 0:06:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=388.0)|
| 0:06:30| I'm humbled and blessed to have the opportunity to have the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=390.0)|
| 0:06:35| It really wasn't something I thought I'd get selected for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=395.0)|
| 0:06:38| I'm 33 years in the business, all of it right here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=398.0)|
| 0:06:45| I interviewed to ask a lot of questions because we'd never had a Public Safety Director in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=405.0)|
| 0:06:49| In three decades, I've been answering emergency calls anyway, so I was really surprised when Jenny called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=409.0)|
| 0:06:59| She may have been surprised that I was the number one person on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=419.0)|
| 0:07:03| She would surprise me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=423.0)|
| 0:07:06| But again, I'm humbled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=426.0)|
| 0:07:08| I feel blessed to be a part of this from the ground up, and I look forward to working with each of you in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=428.0)|
| 0:07:15| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=435.0)|
| 0:07:16| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=436.0)|
| 0:07:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=438.0)|
| 0:07:19| Welcome to the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=439.0)|
| 0:07:21| Could you go into a little bit more detail about your role and responsibilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=441.0)|
| 0:07:25| We kind of got a big picture, but since it's essentially a new position, who do you report to, and what are your objectives right out of the gate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=445.0)|
| 0:07:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=455.0)|
| 0:07:36| From a public safety aspect, of course, I report to Jenny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=456.0)|
| 0:07:40| I'm under the direction of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=460.0)|
| 0:07:43| Really, the Public Safety Office is going to do some coordination for the fire and rescue services inside Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=463.0)|
| 0:07:52| The biggest thing is making sure our fire and rescue services are sustainable long after our careers are over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=472.0)|
| 0:07:59| Small incremental changes now can mean 20 years from now our agencies are still able to provide the high level of service they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=479.0)|
| 0:08:08| And believe it or not, those agency leaders are also concerned is a little bit of a strong word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=488.0)|
| 0:08:14| but they want to know that the county wants to ensure that they're sustainable as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=494.0)|
| 0:08:20| Does that include EMS as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=500.0)|
| 0:08:22| Well, I am not part of the EMS bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=502.0)|
| 0:08:25| Obviously, EMS is something that we also need to ensure is sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=505.0)|
| 0:08:31| I hope to be in conversations when that progresses a little further after some of the consulting and the contracting is released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=511.0)|
| 0:08:38| Yeah, we're eminently heading in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=518.0)|
| 0:08:41| Yeah, and I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=521.0)|
| 0:08:43| Unfortunately, the EMS issue is a nationwide problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=523.0)|
| 0:08:47| We see it locally, obviously, because we're exposed to it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=527.0)|
| 0:08:51| But we are not unique with the problems that are ongoing in the EMS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=531.0)|
| 0:08:56| Our primary concern is fire and rescue services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=536.0)|
| 0:09:00| And like I said, we want to ensure that they're sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=540.0)|
| 0:09:02| And believe it or not, those agency leaders are also, like I said, concerned as well to ensure that they're a viable resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=542.0)|
| 0:09:10| You know, as you guys mentioned on the last meeting, we're growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=550.0)|
| 0:09:15| We've got a housing shortage, and we have people moving into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=555.0)|
| 0:09:18| So I don't foresee those requests for those services decreasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=558.0)|
| 0:09:21| I've never seen emergency service requests decrease over the decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=561.0)|
| 0:09:26| And again, we just need to look at ways to ensure that we're doing what's right and what's best for the citizen at the least amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=566.0)|
| 0:09:33| And I think that's really our number one priority once we get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=573.0)|
| 0:09:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=578.0)|
| 0:09:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=581.0)|
| 0:09:42| Seeing no more lights on, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=582.0)|
| 0:09:45| And we are happy that you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=585.0)|
| 0:09:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=587.0)|
| 0:09:55| We do not have any public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=595.0)|
| 0:10:00| Anyone signed up for public forum for agenda items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=600.0)|
| 0:10:03| So that moves us to our next approval of minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=603.0)|
| 0:10:13| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=613.0)|
