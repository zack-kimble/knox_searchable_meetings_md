| 0:02:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| I had a question, and maybe it's for the staff and for this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| This is a brand-new business that you're opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| Yes, sir, Councilman Wolff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| Is there any, and this would be for the staff, I guess, is there any different or special training when you open a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| for getting the license or getting the servers ready, or is it the same process that everyone goes through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=149)|
| 0:02:37| Same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| And you have a plan in place to get your employees certified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| Absolutely, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| We'll meet all requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| Lance Meyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| This is, as I understand it, you're opening up what has occasionally been referred to as a downtown grocery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| which people have been excited about for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| Can you take a second and just fill us in on what you're going to be doing and where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| and maybe even take a second to do an ad for all those thousands watching on TV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| I appreciate the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| We have been working hard to, and my partner, John Haas, just came in, so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| He's a little late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| But we're in the space that was formerly Magpie's, which was a specialty bakery shop that catered to local restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=200)|
| 0:03:29| and also did wedding cakes and, you know, special order stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| But John came in to be my new partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| I've owned that building for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| And Magpie's left and went on up north central, and it's been sitting empty for 15 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| And John and I got together when he became my new partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| and we put a plan together to bring a grocery store in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| It's a full-service grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| We're working with a local farmer's co-op to offer most, you know, we're going local on everything that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=233)|
| 0:04:00| Mayfield, Cruz Dairy, JFG Coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| We want to be good neighbors, and we want to keep the money right here in Knox County if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| And we'll have, you know, everything from groceries, and we'll have organic and natural options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=248)|
| 0:04:15| but we'll also have your everyday necessities, cleaning products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| anything a new resident would need to live here in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| And it could be really a general merchandise type of store opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| But, you know, groceries are going to be our focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| You want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Hey, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| If you could give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| John Haas, 2215 Highland Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| We've been working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| I'm sure, I don't know if he mentioned, we've been putting in some long hours there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| So I got relatively cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=301)|

| 0:05:06| Bearden Beer Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| Bearden Beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| Christopher Morton, 4431 Oakhurst Drive in Louisville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| Officer, I have no applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| Mr. Marvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| Move to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| Not all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Those, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| Can we ask him to also tell us a little bit about this new facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| We basically are bringing American Craft Beer to the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| It's been a trend across the nation that we'd like to bring to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| really show the exemplary qualities of American Craft Beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| And then we're also going to be a little bit of a convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| where we sell M&M's to sodas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| We're positioned next door to Ash's Wine and Spirits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| which in fact gives us the only one-stop shop with a store and a liquor store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=371)|
| 0:06:18| in the same parking lot where you can get out of your car one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| So it's just a convenience for the Bearden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| and then a focus on six packs of American Craft Beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| Thank you and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| You left me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| I was just going to ask Chris before he left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| Chris, isn't American Craft Beer like a micro-brew or what exactly is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| Yeah, the term micro-brew has kind of shifted to American Craft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=400)|
| 0:06:47| As opposed to these big houses like Anheuser and that kind of thing, Coors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| The largest of the large would be Stone Brewing in San Diego area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| They do 200,000 barrels, which is a drop in the bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| When we talk about the American Craft segment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| it represents just 6% of the overall beer market in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| and it's been growing tremendously over the last three, four, five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| That was kind of the state of the world before Prohibition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| and all these things died off and the giants came, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| Honestly, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| In the last year, we now have more breweries in the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| than we ever have pre-Prohibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| So it's definitely a renaissance period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| not only for the larger producers like Stone and legions of others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| but brew pubs and even home brewers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| It's becoming grassroots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| I apologize, Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| I couldn't see your light for the name plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| Oh, I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| This is Charles's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Oh, it's Charles's, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Yeah, Red Box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| It was intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=468)|

| 0:08:35| Call is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| Oh, this is an easy one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| I want you to tell us about your fine establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| Well, basically, if you're familiar with Moe's or Chipotle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| Moe's is where I'm more of the gourmet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| I do everything from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| The reason for beer is where we're located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| And it increases revenues, but we do everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| I don't even own a freezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Everything is freshly made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| You come in, you order what, you just go down the line and tell us what you want on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| Burritos, nachos, tacos, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| But it is definitely fresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| You're not going to find any fresher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Well, good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Welcome to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| We're delighted to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| You mentioned your location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| And we have discussed in this beer board a number of times the vulnerability of the population that visits those restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=561)|
| 0:09:29| and those businesses along the Cumberland Avenue Strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| Please take every due caution and precaution in serving those customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| Trust me, me and the missus are well aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| I've been here all my life, so I'm well aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Councilman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| I think the translation of what you said is we want to keep the football players playing on the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=589)|
| 0:09:57| I'm sorry, Councilman Talbot, but that's not what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| Appreciate you taking the care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Any fish, tacos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| I'll come anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| We have certified Angus beef, which there's not very many that offer certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| They can say Angus beef, but you have to be certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| And it was quite an ordeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| I got an education on that, which is only about six restaurants in Knoxville that offer certified Angus beef.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Thank you and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Gunthor's Gulf Shore Grill is asked to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| So it would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| Move to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| Discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Mr. Chairman, can I ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| What is the process they would have to reapply and start over again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| I think there were some lease issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| Ian's Market is requested to be heard, postponed this evening to the next beer board motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| and I will make that motion if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Is there discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Cats on the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=680)|
| 0:11:28| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Hi there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Kathleen Lee, 441 Tucker Road, Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Officer Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Waiting on approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Ms. Lee, I think this may be the first permit that we have heard in the South Waterfront District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| The city recently worked with the council in passing a form-based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| which is a little bit different way of approaching zoning in the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| and I just wanted to make sure that when you applied for your permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| you were provided with those restrictions and you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| It's a great way of doing business, but a little different way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| and we want to make sure that everybody that comes in there is on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| Vice Mayor, your last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| I actually had a similar comment that this feels like, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| the first beer permit we've had in the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| and traditionally we get a zone of C-something, which we know allows alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| and I want to ask Mr. Swanson, I assume that SW4 does allow for alcohol sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| I have to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| I'd have to research that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Most of the zoning categories I know already, but I don't know the South Waterfront zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=760)|
| 0:12:47| I made a call to Mr. Hill today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| Did you check that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| I did not hear back from him, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| I'm assuming it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| I mean, 1 and 2 are the residential ones, and after that, so I'm assuming it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| but it's a new nomenclature we have to get used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| If it doesn't, adopting this motion will not make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| It still won't be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| We're fairly certain it is, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| I held it would have made you totally uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| I think Mr. Becker's comment was, but you're on your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Let me bring this meeting back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| You all are scaring me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Are you going to allow the property owner in your establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| Only if he behaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| And that would be former Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| Underwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| Underwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| That would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Ms. Lee, the other folks that have been before us have given a little advertisement when they are new businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| Could you do the same for yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Well, what I'm trying to do is bring the community back in over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| because it's lost a lot of the business from the previous owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| And we've done a lot of cleanup around there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| and just trying to make it a nice little neighborhood establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| to keep the community safe at home instead of having to travel too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Not that I want to be self-promoting here in the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| but I am by that a lot, and the building does look great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| They've done a really nice job of upgrading and what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| and I hope that trend will continue as this waterfront develops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| We've worked hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| Still got a little ways to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| We've got a second in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Is there further discussion on Cats on the River?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Those, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=875)|

| 0:15:04| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Before we hear it, let's hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| What do you have going on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| Well, there's lots to do and lots of things coming up at the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| The permits are for Zoofari and for Feast with the Beast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| Zoofari, I think everyone knows as the wildest, one of the wildest parties in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| but Feast with the Beast definitely is the wildest party in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| So Zoofari is June 5th, and tickets are available at our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=928)|
| 0:15:35| And Feast with the Beast is August 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| And, again, tickets are available on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| And if you buy them from mid-May to July 4th, there's $10 off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=943)|
| 0:15:52| So it's a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| We have a number of other events coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| We have Dream Night, which we participate every year with Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| That evening, May 7th, is one where Children's Hospital sends some special people out to the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| And it's a nationwide program that zoos undertake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| and they try to get involved and bring some, as I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| very special people out to the zoo with their caregivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| May 15th, we have Princess Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| And that's all the girls under 12 come in their princess costume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| and all the boys come as princes or frogs, whichever they'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| They can all have a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| Well, they come as frogs, but they leave as princes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Yeah, that's right. That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Yes, I just wanted to ask Mr. Vilna for a second plug,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| and that is Zoofari and Feast with the Beast, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| are some of the big fundraisers you have at the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Would you tell us about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| Because the zoo is one of the treasures of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| and I think the people need to know that this is a chance for them to support the zoo and its future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Zoofari is our annual gala.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| And last year we had the best Zoofari, I think, that we've ever had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| and each year tends to outdo the year before, and we're hoping that will be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| But we were able to raise over $200,000 for the zoo at the last Zoofari.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1042)|
| 0:17:29| And it is one of the most fun parties in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| It addresses zoo casual, so it isn't a black tie event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| It's come in the evening and have a good time and spend it with some of the animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| and we have a lot of special things going on that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| And Feast with the Beast, those that have attended that program, I think, know how fun that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1064)|
| 0:17:53| Lots of food to eat from some of the best restaurants in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| and then also lots of beverages to partake in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1086)|

| 0:18:44| It's kind of near Regus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| It's maybe a block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1125)|

| 0:19:23| Rodeo Bar and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| Chairman, move that we hear this at the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1167)|

| 0:19:44| Quick Grocery and Deli, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| If you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| My name is Faris Mohammed Al-Anas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| The address is 605 Gims AG Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Officer Huston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1204)|

| 0:20:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Councilwoman Marotti?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| This question is for the permitting department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| It seems like we just heard this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| Is this a change in ownership already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Could you explain a little bit what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| You did approve a permit last month, and the applicant did obtain the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| and I think this gentleman is taking it over from that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1234)|

| 0:20:36| Motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| There's a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| We'll begin this day, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| Is anyone here from Latitude 35?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1251)|
| 0:21:00| A little birdie told me they were going to be here this evening, but I guess not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1260)|
| 0:21:09| As you know, this came to you last month for an extension of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| because they had not completed the things that needed to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| and they will need an extension of time to keep this BIPR permit application viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| So we would recommend 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Mr. Chairman, I was on Market Square today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| and actually went there thinking I might be able to have lunch, hoping they were open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| And they weren't, but there was a lot of activity inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| So, you know, having seen folks there and making an investment on our square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| I would think it would be worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Even though they're not here tonight, which I hate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| I think it might be worth it for this board to give them the consideration of another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| Next time, I hope they'll come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| Well, I mean, do you feel like they're going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Have you spoken with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| I spoke with one of the builders, and they were going to try to open this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| And that doesn't necessarily mean beer sales, but they were going to try to open Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| We're going to have a special meeting for an establishment at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1330)|
| 0:22:19| Would we have to bring this up, or we could just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| So they can just go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| We're back to, excuse me, councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| I was wondering if I could inquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| I remember maybe a month ago we had a gentleman from Mechanicsville that had a building he was restoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| and wanted to get beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Did he ever come back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Well, I don't think he came back, but we did pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| I remember it was postponed at least two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| We're back to Rodeo Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Vote on the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| No, this is actually after the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| I kind of got lost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Extension to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Is that the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Yeah, I wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| I know since we have to, well, we don't have to wait for Rodeo Bar, but I know we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| beer sting this past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| It did not go well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| And I just wanted Officer Husky to let everybody know again what happened and any thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| about why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| You don't usually talk long, so yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| We checked a lot of establishments in and around downtown and the Strip especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| It had been a little while since we had checked those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| A couple places I think did not look at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| One place up off Clinton Highway normally checks at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| They're 21 and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| They had no door person there when our people went in, so I guess the bartender assumed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| that they were checked at the door and they wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| That seems to happen quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| The bartender will not check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| They rely on the door person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| And a lot of them, they just got in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| They looked at the ID but didn't look for the red stripe, didn't pay attention to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| And we had one sale pretty much deliberately on purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| He knew they were underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| And we had 29 establishments visited and 12 of them sold, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| How many strikes do they get in the system in terms of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| Well, if you'll hold that thought, since we've got some time, I was going to get Charles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| to perhaps run through that process for us unbeknownst to Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1484)|
| 0:24:51| Surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| But first let me address Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| I just wanted to follow up on Vice Mayor Becker's statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| I'm URAL's representative to the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| and I was appalled at the compliance rate of this last compliance check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| particularly, again, given the vulnerable population in and around UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| and that many of the 29 establishments visited were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| and many of the failing establishments were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| And when you look at the information we were provided as a beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| not only did they serve the underage person, but they failed to even check the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| and that's just not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| So I'd love to hear from Mr. Swanson as to how we follow up on this kind of result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| Sure. Let's go to Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| How often do you do checks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| I think we have about 600 beer permits in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| Do you have someone out there checking every weekend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| Well, as far as the stings, those are set up special, but as far as bar checks, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| We go in and check for underage that are inside drinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| but the stings are just set up on special nights that they don't know we're coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1567)|
| 0:26:14| Well, Officer Husky, if I could, what happens if you've got three people that come to a table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| and they send one guy up to the bar who's 21 or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| and the other ones are underage and they come back with three beers or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| If we observe that, the person that got the beers for them would be the one that would get charged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| not the bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Not the bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Because he's the one that's actually facilitating the violation of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| I don't see any more lights in Rodeo Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| No one else has come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| So I want to make a motion that we postpone this until the next beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Go ahead and finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| I had one question that someone's asked me for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| I'll ask when you're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| I'll go ahead and make the motion to move this to the next beer board agenda at Rodeo Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| And all those in favor of that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Councilman Bailey, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| I guess this is a question to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| What identifications are store owners allowed to accept from obviously from the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1634)|
| 0:27:23| from other states?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| What about from other countries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| What all are allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| Well, and I would tell you it depends on what type of establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| Gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Shop and go kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Gas station is a government issued ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| That's what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| As far as your nightclubs, your restaurants, they are not even required to check ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| So that would be up to the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| Because number one, they're not required to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| So if they do ask to look, it's pretty much up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| Liquor stores, they're not required to ask for ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| So a gas station, what about a license from Mexico or from Canada?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1686)|
| 0:28:14| Government, any government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| It just says government issued ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| I'm now confused by the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| You said that other than the gas station, these other facilities like nightclubs didn't have to get a formal ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1702)|
| 0:28:30| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| How do they make their decision about whether this is an underage or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| It's their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| You can't ask for it or ask the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| A lot of them, it's their policy to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| It's their policy, but that's their own policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| A lot of them have a policy where they ID at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| Your nightclubs will do that, but that's their policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| It's not the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| So they have to have some methodology of doing it, and they do it at their peril, I guess is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| That's Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Mr. Swanson, you might know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| When the state had the requirement for checking IDs that I know they had for a little while and it expired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| did that only include off-premise sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Now, we have the authority to regulate on and off-premise sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| We can't regulate liquor stores, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| We cannot require them to have an ID, but we could actually require restaurants to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1758)|
| 0:29:26| The state has only given to municipalities the authority to regulate 5% beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| Beyond that, the state is in charge of the regulation, and so they have not delegated that to municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Officer Husky, what's your gut tell you about why so many violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| Is it just an aberration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| Have you seen this before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| Like I say, one place usually turns us down at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| There wasn't a door person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Another place, some newer employees, that's a place that normally does not sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| But prior to this, you were noticing, what, the opposite, more discipline, more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| Well, it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| A lot of stings will hit a lot of off-premise beer places where they're required to look at the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| and they have a register that assists them when they put the birth date in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| So if we check 30 places and we have 20 of those on there, you know, two or three of those will sell out of the 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1824)|
| 0:30:32| But the places we checked were primarily sit-down places where there are college kids frequent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| And, you know, they just get in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| They didn't pay enough attention to the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| I mean, that's their excuse to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| I was busy, and I just glanced at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Got my curiosity up again now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| Are you finding that it's young clerks serving young people, or is there any pattern to what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1854)|
| 0:31:02| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| So it just depends on the establishment and the particular date of the sting, what causes the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| Sometimes they're on the cell phone and not paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| They're just human beings screwing up occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| Sometimes they just can't add to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| Mr. Swanson, if you wouldn't mind, I know we've got some administrative hearings coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| and because this is we've got new members to this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| if you could kind of walk us through from A to Z in that process, I think it would be very beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1887)|
| 0:31:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| Just at the outset, I would remind you that the only type of violation out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| is not necessarily just violations involving sales to persons who are not of legal age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| and so we treat those things differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| We have a whole separate set of ordinances and regulations with regard to selling to underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1911)|
| 0:31:58| and I think that's principally what you're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| If there are violations of matters other than sale to underage persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| generally that's handled through a recommendation being made to the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| the law department preparing charges, those charges being served on the permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| and the permit holder having a hearing before a designated hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| So there's that process that's sort of outside of what you typically talk about in terms of violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| What you're typically talking about in terms of violations is sales to underage persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| and with regard to that, we sort of have a three-strike system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| and the three-strike system is on the first occasion when a permit holder sells to someone underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1959)|
| 0:32:48| that person is required to file a remedial plan with the city recorder's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1968)|
| 0:32:57| I believe they pay a $250 fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| and they file their remedial plan with the police department explaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| how they're going to keep similar violations from occurring in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| Then if there is another sale to an underage person within two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| then that person has to file a new remedial plan, a revised remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=1995)|
| 0:33:22| with the city recorder's office, and they have to pay a $500 fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2002)|
| 0:33:30| and they are required to come before you and essentially explain why to you this second offense happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2010)|
| 0:33:38| and how their remedial plan is going to prevent any future offenses from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2018)|
| 0:33:46| At that occasion, or frankly at any occasion, should the beer board elect to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| you can send, as you have done in the past, you can send, whether it's one violation, two violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| or multiple violations beyond two violations, you can elect to ask the law department to prepare charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| and take that permit holder before a hearing officer and have a hearing with regard to those charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2045)|
| 0:34:14| Historically, in those situations where there have been just two violations within a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2054)|
| 0:34:21| if you're satisfied with a remedial plan and if you're satisfied with the concept that this permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| takes this whole thing very seriously and is attempting to work within the system to prevent sales to underage persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2067)|
| 0:34:35| typically you have told the permit holder, don't come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| If they do come back, if there is a third sale within that two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| then that permit holder is automatically then goes to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| The law department prepares charges and that goes to before the hearing officer for a suspension or revocation hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2089)|
| 0:34:57| and resolution by the hearing officer with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| What have I left out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| And that is after the two years, does the slate start over again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| Once you've had two years clean, you start again as a new offender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| So if you've had two clean years behind you, no matter when your sale is, you look back two full years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| If there's nothing within that two full years, then you're a first offender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| And you start with the first of the three strikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| But there's a different rule if they're coming for their initial permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| and they have an offense within two, three, four years or something, up to ten years, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| If you have been convicted of an offense involving...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| A full legal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| Yes, if you've had a full legal process and you've been convicted of an offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| of a violation of an ordinance or a state law with respect to alcohol, essentially, storage, unlawful sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2149)|
| 0:35:59| all those kinds of things, you are not eligible for a permit for ten years from that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| Most of these folks, the person who gets convicted is the person who actually made the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| Usually the permit holder is not the person or entity that gets convicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| The server on duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| The server on duty is the one who actually, if anybody gets convicted, that's usually who gets convicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| So you're typically not dealing with those circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| What you're typically dealing with is a permit holder who is responsible for the supervision of a business establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2186)|
| 0:36:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| I wanted to ask, I guess you, Charles, a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| The other night we had, a couple of weeks ago, we had a couple of sales to underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| and then we had a gambling machine involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| And I don't recall having seen the gambling machine come to us like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| To what extent do we look at a gambling machine compared to sale to underage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2215)|
| 0:37:02| That's what I was talking to you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| If the police department believes that this needs to be addressed, then they make a recommendation to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| The law department reviews the situation and makes a further determination as to whether this is an appropriate case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| to bring before a hearing officer for a suspension or revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| And if that is the case, then that's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| And it doesn't have to be any multiple number of offenses or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| They just make the determination as to whether this is a situation that needs to be dealt with in the hearing officer hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2247)|
| 0:37:37| Over the years, I've grown accustomed to the establishments coming here and making their case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2257)|
| 0:37:44| and seeing how serious they are about it and to what extent they're going to make changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| and even some of the larger ones spend money on cash registers and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| And I just looked at a gambling machine kind of differently like that's more of a criminal thing rather than a beer board issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| Certainly it may be, but it's also under our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| It would be a violation of our code to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| So actually the police department has a couple of options there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| They can bring charges in the Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| They can bring charges in the criminal context as opposed to having a suspension or revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| Or they could do both if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| Because, you know, we do sort of sit up here like judges and not in a legislative capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| And I just didn't know how much weight to put on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| And I'll take it up with you later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| Help me understand it a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Counselwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| In regards to this discussion, Mr. Swanson, could you explain a little bit why there's a separate permit for dancing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2324)|
| 0:38:52| And my follow-up question would be for Mr. Husky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| do you ever cite an establishment for dancing when they're not supposed to be dancing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2335)|
| 0:39:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| There's been on-and-off permit and on-and-off permit with dancing since before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2346)|
| 0:39:15| So it's more than a quarter of a century we've had that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| And I don't know historically why we had separate permits for those two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| I would presume that at some point in history there was some concept that dancing added another level of risk to the whole concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2365)|
| 0:39:35| And, therefore, you needed a special permit to allow dancing and beer drinking to be going on in the same establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2375)|
| 0:39:44| Mr. Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| Officer Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| We have cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| If we go in a place and they're dancing and they don't have dancing on their permit, yes, we have cited for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2387)|
| 0:39:55| One of the reasons, I guess, could be is they have to have a designated dance floor area that the fire marshal looks at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| It has to be set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| It has to be so big because, I guess, if you didn't, they'd be dancing in the aisles at the restaurant or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2402)|
| 0:40:09| You wouldn't have any control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| Mr. Swanson, would it be possible to look at our code of ordinances in regards to allowing dancing safely within the purview of the fire marshal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2411)|
| 0:40:20| but perhaps not regulating dancing in conjunction with beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| We can always look at making changes to the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| We've been pursuing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| Well, I don't see any more lights and I don't know if any other business has come before this board tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| so I would entertain a motion to dismiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100420?start=2441)|
