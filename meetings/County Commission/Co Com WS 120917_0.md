| 0:00:26| We salute our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=26)|
| 0:00:28| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=28)|
| 0:00:33| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=33)|

| 0:00:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| We're going to brighten your day, this rainy day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=48)|
| 0:00:50| with some interesting stuff from County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=50)|
| 0:00:54| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=54)|
| 0:00:56| First of all, amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=56)|
| 0:00:58| We've got kind of a complex set of things here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=58)|
| 0:01:04| Let me start with a few of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| and then those who are going to need to add some items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=65)|
| 0:01:10| please come forward there and be ready to come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=70)|
| 0:01:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| First of all, Item 112, which is Number 8 on our agenda, the ethics appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=74)|
| 0:01:22| we'd like to defer those for 30 days to review resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=82)|
| 0:01:31| Two items that I had, Number 33 and Number 35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| I would like to defer both of those for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| That's 901 and 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| I'd also like to add for discussion via our reorganization a couple of committee actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=109)|
| 0:01:59| and that is the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| For discussion, we need to talk about the Rules Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| and we need to talk about the Insolvency Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| So I'd like to add those as discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| And then let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| And I think that's all that I have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| So let's go ahead with the other adds to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| Martha Buchanan, Knox County Health Department, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| I'd like to add Number 29, the Item 603.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| It's a contract between Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| and Variety for safe sleep education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| I would respectfully request that we add Items 211 and 212,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| and those are items that the school board has taken action on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| and because of the timing of the agenda setting are not currently on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| but I would respectfully request they be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| Mr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| If we could, we would like to defer Item 23 for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| We actually captured our data sample between September 8th and 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| We wanted to wait until school was fully in session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| and everything had settled down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| That data has been shipped to the consulting engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| so we should be able to come back to you next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Can I say something to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Hey, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| I'm getting a lot of emails on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| The turnaround, the turnabout, or roundabouts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| I'm getting a lot of emails about that in regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| we've had one fatality since we decided to redo the reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| I'd like to advocate for these turnarounds and these roundabouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| and push this forward as quickly as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| We should be ready next month with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to add Number 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Other amendments from the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| Ms. Sprouls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| I'd like to add 906 and 907, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| And as we're talking about rules committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| I'm glad you added that as a discussion item, or just the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| I would like for us to discuss how many of these committees are actually functioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| and whether or not we truly need these committees or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| We'll incorporate that into that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| Mr. Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| Yeah, I'd like to withdraw Number 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| After speaking to a lot of constituents, they do not want this excessive spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| so I'm going to pull mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| I guess I really want to have a discussion item, but I guess I'd like to add Number 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| But what I'm really wanting to do, because I think there's some logistical things that we need to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| as it relates to my resolution, so I'll just add 909 and we'll discuss it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=316)|
| 0:05:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| And prior to all of these items that are really related to our budget surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| and designations that we may be for individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| Chris Caldwell has asked to speak to those in reference to sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| So before that starts, whoever that was, it was Mr. Owenby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| but now that Mr. Owenby has withdrawn his, wherever that is, when we start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| we're going to ask Mr. Caldwell to come forward and talk about sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| That's okay with the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| That's his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| And then also a question on 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| I'm guessing those funds are going to start flowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| So if we defer, I would hate to not, I mean, I would hate to take action on this either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=372)|
| 0:06:21| I mean, if we're going to disperse them, it's getting a little late in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| We kind of need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| If not, we need to be kind of clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| So I'm just trying to understand how that 30-day deferral is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| What's the reason for that deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| Okay, the reason for the deferral for me is, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| this is my first time right out of the chute as chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| and this would require me to probably relinquish the chair to discuss the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| And so I feel like I'd like to have 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| Mr. Caldwell, could you speak to the disbursement of funds to the chamber and the timing thereof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=415)|
| 0:07:09| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| The chamber is reimbursed on a quarterly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| so they will turn in reimbursements report every quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| and the county will reimburse them at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| That's how all the defined service contracts work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| So that date, so their first check potentially would be issued what date, July, August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=446)|
| 0:07:34| Would it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| They would turn their request in sometime in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| Sometime in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| And then we would reimburse them at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| So this may or may not delay that dispersal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| I guess that's my, I guess, question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| So potentially this wouldn't delay the dispersal if they give you the report in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| and we address this issue in October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| Yeah, I mean, if you wait until the end of October, then, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| I can't say, I can't speak to the point of how often they reimburse after the quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| If it's a week, two weeks, or three, I'm not really for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Let me ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Is the chamber here today prepared to discuss this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| They weren't notified that it was going to be deferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| Then I don't see any reason not to go ahead and hear it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| Commissioner, this is Mike Edwards for 102 Market Square, 17 Market Square, 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=511)|
| 0:08:44| We are here in regard to a comment the law department had made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| We made arrangements to have our attorney here to respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| So we're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Full blast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| So I guess we need a ruling from the body about accepting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| or rejecting the idea of a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| I'll make a motion that we hear it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=560)|
| 0:09:28| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Debate about the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=576)|
| 0:09:46| Ms. Perales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| I don't have a problem with it being heard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| And I understand this is your first meeting and you have to, I guess, step aside and let Larry do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| But Larry has run meetings before, committee meetings, and has done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| So I'm sure he'd be okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| But I do want to point out that last month the chamber asked that we defer it for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| because they were not all here and ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| So as far as that goes, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| Or they had wanted to defer it because they didn't have their legal representation here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| which I certainly understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| And that was a valid reason for deferring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| And I didn't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| So I just want us to make sure that both sides of this are being treated equitably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=627)|
| 0:10:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| I'm on the fence on this because I believe I'm agreeing with Amy that we would like to see both sides treated the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=646)|
| 0:10:56| when requests are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| The thing about it is, though, we can still hear what their legal we can hear the legal wrangling today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| And after that, if we want to defer for 30 days, we can still defer it or we can take it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| But for the preparation that's been taken by the chamber, I believe we need to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=670)|
| 0:11:17| If they're ready to present something, how we act or when we act is not really the issue in accepting their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=677)|
| 0:11:27| Have you burst into flames yet, Dave, for saying that you agreed with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| I've agreed with you frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| It just came out that the chamber did ask in advance that it be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| And so they are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| And I see no reason why we shouldn't hear what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| I agree with Mr. Wright that if we want to defer it, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| We don't have to necessarily have to take action today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| But since they are here and since they are prepared to answer these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| I'd like to see them go ahead and answer the questions that were brought up by our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| I have just an addition to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| I'm still waiting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| You know, I guess I agree with most of what Commissioner Hammond said in the last statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=727)|
| 0:12:16| I just think that this issue is I think we all understand the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| I think we all want to hear both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| And it sounds like this deferral isn't, and I'm speaking for our chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| but it doesn't sound like he was prepared last month, and I'm sure he's prepared this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| But this was more a deferral for the logistics of how we enact this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| how we step down and, like Commissioner Broad said, I think O'Leary is ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| and capable to step in in his steed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| And I'd just rather hear it and deliberate on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| And let's get through this because, you know, at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| it's probably not a good thing for us to be in the headlines back and forth with the Chamber, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| It's just I'd rather just let's hear it, let's deal with it, and then let's kind of move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| That's just my personal opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| Seeing that no more lights are on relative to that subject, let's have a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=795)|
| 0:13:24| All in favor of hearing the Chamber of Commerce issue today say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=808)|

| 0:13:31| All those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| So it will be heard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| Unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| It's 7.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=823)|

| 0:14:07| I'd like to ask that item number 37 be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=847)|
| 0:14:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Any other ads or withdrawals or deferrals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| Mr. Chairman, as well as items number four and five, I think those are to be added as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| Those are just resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=870)|

| 0:14:39| Could we hear a motion for all those items to be added, deferred, withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=879)|

| 0:19:43| District 5. Dr. Briggs. Dr. Briggs. Who's your BZA? It's uh. Schoonmaker. Schoonmaker. John Schoonmaker. And district 7? Bill Sewell. We got it? Yeah. Okay all in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1183)|
| 0:20:12| Item number 7 resolution 111. It's a resolution appointing an individual recommended by the East Tennessee chapter of the Institute of Internal Auditors and an individual recommended by the Knox chapter of the Tennessee Society of Certified Public Accountants to the Knox County Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1212)|
| 0:20:31| Okay we have attached resumes on for one of these positions and I think it's my understanding that Mary Kaiser can be reappointed and that's from Richard Wall's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1231)|
| 0:20:50| They're still going to submit names but Mary will probably be among the names. Okay so would be also I've learned that it's possible that Dr. Carsello is not going to necessarily leave and so he could be back in to the mix for reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1250)|
| 0:21:12| And so. I was just going to say he didn't submit his resume through TSCPA. He has not submitted it? Has not. Okay well in light of those things is it seems appropriate that we defer for 30 days? No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1272)|
| 0:21:33| Well I was wondering could we just take no action and could we get, is it time enough if Dr. Carsello wants to, could he do it by next Monday is my question? It's possible. I think that's what I had heard that it's possible that he would know this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1293)|
| 0:21:48| Make a motion to defer without recommendation. Second. Okay. I don't think we meet until, we meet in November so we'd be in the Audit Committee in November the 13th yeah so we're fine on the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1308)|
| 0:22:03| I think it's the will of the, we hope we do get Mary Kaiser back. Right. Love to have Dr. Carsello continue but I think it's in flux or transition and Amy knows, had a lunch with him, knows more than I do but at our meeting last week he did not indicate that he was going to, he planned to stay with us unless it was an emergency and we couldn't get a replacement so I concur on the postponement for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1323)|
| 0:22:29| Mr. Wright. Thank you Mr. Chairman. As a member of the Audit Committee I had mentioned maybe earlier that we needed a discussion item about the Audit Committee. There were a couple things presented at the last Audit Committee that we probably need to relay to Commission. Could we not do that right at the moment but add that on at the end of the meeting just to discuss the Audit Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1349)|
| 0:22:55| Add a discussion item to discuss Audit. Yeah rather than taking that up right now. Any objection to that as a discussion item? Okay then we'll do that. Thank you sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1375)|
| 0:23:07| Okay and then let's, can we go ahead and act on the motion of no recommendation? Do I hear a second? Second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? Ayes have it. So hopefully we'll know something about Dr. Carsello before Monday when we meet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1387)|
| 0:23:27| The next item is number 10 Resolution 202. It's approving a contract in the amount up to $5,000, $5 million I'm sorry, annually with Digital Connections Inc. for installation services for structured cable and other low voltage systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1407)|
| 0:23:45| Dr. McIntyre would you like to speak to that? Motion to approve. We have a motion and second. Go ahead. Thank you Mr. Chairman. This is an item that was approved by the Knox County Board of Education. It is a potential contract for technology support services. So basically infrastructure for wiring and for wireless switches and routers and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1425)|
| 0:24:12| The $5 million is an up to amount and that would, so therefore it's as needed and it would be only up to that amount. And I believe it has the potential to be a five year contract. So that's a not to exceed amount and it has the potential to be a five year contract. So it's a little bit aspirational in terms of the amount that's on the piece of paper here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1452)|
| 0:24:29| We're likely not to hit that threshold, but we wanted to build in the capacity in case the funding is forthcoming in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1469)|
| 0:24:38| Okay, thank you. There's a consent item, so we don't really need to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| Well, I just had a question. Question, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| And I don't know if you or one of your staff members, could you just talk a little bit about the outfit that you've chosen? I mean, what's their pedigree experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1487)|
| 0:24:58| I believe it was just a straight bid process and so is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| And I'll ask our purchasing folks to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| I thought that it was and so I don't know a whole lot about them except that they were, you know, deemed qualified through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1509)|
| 0:25:20| That's confirmed by Mr. Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| The reason I asked for it to be pulled, Dr. McIntyre, number one, it says $5 million annually and it didn't say for how long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1525)|
| 0:25:33| but you clarified that with a five-year contract, which, if my math is correct, is $25 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| That is a lot of wires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| It's just inconceivable to spend that much money on wiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1545)|
| 0:25:53| Wiring and infrastructure, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| So, again, it's the back-end systems, switches and routers and things that would allow us to have, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1555)|
| 0:26:04| if we were to receive additional funding or, for example, if we were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| the Board of Education is considering applying for the Race to the Top district competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| There's a new, you know, Tennessee won the state-by-state competition for Race to the Top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| The U.S. Department of Education is putting out a new application for a district competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| It's up to 25, I think it's up to $25 to $40 million per district, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| Now, do we have a, you know, are the odds long on our getting that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| But if we did, the focus of the grant is individualized learning environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| and I think there's a pretty substantial potential that that would include a significant investment in technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1600)|
| 0:26:50| to support instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| You know, one of the things that the Board of Education has authorized is a significant technology assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1612)|
| 0:27:00| and analysis to see where we're at today and what it's going to take for us to get where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| Part of what we know is going to be required is that in school year 2014-15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| all of our kids are going to be required by the state of Tennessee to take their TCAP assessments online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| At this moment in time, we're not prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| We don't have the infrastructure to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| We don't have the hardware and software to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| And so there is a potential that we're going to spend a significant amount of resources in the next five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| in order to make some of that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| Again, that will be an ongoing conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| That will be an ongoing dialogue, and this is an up-to amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| It provides us the infrastructure to be able to take care of what we need to take care of in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| if the school board decides to go in that direction and if the resources are forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| Well, that was my next question, was what was the date on taking these tests online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| And you said just for wiring and infrastructure doesn't include any money for computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| My understanding is it's infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| It's not you know there's some hardware associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| And I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Maybe I can bring our technology folks back next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| But when we get to a technical level, I'm not going to be able to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| But it's wiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| It's wireless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| And, you know, access points and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| And then it's the back-end sort of infrastructure that goes along with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| switches and routers and things of that nature that basically allow us to have the connection to our school buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1699)|
| 0:28:27| and then potentially a connection to wireless devices from that infrastructure that we put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| But, I mean, in terms of the specific details of what some of the low-voltage systems are that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| we can certainly provide additional information to the commission in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| Well, you've answered my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| And I just think when I see an expenditure of that amount for that, you know, I think it deserves an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1726)|
| 0:28:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| I think it's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| I'm happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| The following is a paid endorsement of Phil Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| At the last school board meeting, he made a commitment to, and it sort of follows in here, wiring and lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1752)|
| 0:29:20| and I guess I should say scoreboard that Phil Ballard made a commitment to you that he would furnish the scoreboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1760)|
| 0:29:32| for all the little hornets at Carter Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| Well, I want you to know that I only have $200 and you said it's like $3,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| So all the little hornets out there need to get a hold of Phil Ballard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| and help him fulfill his commitment to provide a scoreboard in the middle school gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| And Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Dr. McIntyre, can you give us a sense that we're spending $5 million each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| What is the longevity of this stuff that you're getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| Are you going to go to different schools and then upgrade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| How long is this going to last us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| And, Commissioner, again, just to be clear, I don't anticipate spending $5 million in each of the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Is there a single year where we might spend something close to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| There could be, and that's why we've structured it the way that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| But, again, I think there's a great deal of work to be done in terms of having the infrastructure for connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1821)|
| 0:30:29| in our schools and the infrastructure, if we choose going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| to have a robust wireless infrastructure to support instructional technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| So, again, I don't anticipate at this moment in time, I don't anticipate us spending anywhere near $5 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1838)|
| 0:30:46| But if we're going to put the contract in place and we're going to put it in place for the next five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| we want to be somewhat aspirational and put the structure in place in case there are additional resources forthcoming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1850)|
| 0:30:58| in case we do see a grant that comes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| or if we do have a more pervasive conversation about instructional technology in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| and make a considerable investment in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| So, again, absent that, I think the spending annually is going to be considerably less than the ceiling that's in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1868)|
| 0:31:17| So my question is, of the items that you're putting in, the hardware that you're putting in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| what's the longevity of it that you anticipate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| How long does it last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| How long would the individual pieces of technology that we put in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| To be honest with you, Commissioner, I couldn't answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| I'd have to have some more technical folks tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| You know, you and I talked last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| We had a great lunch together and enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| If you come back and you see that one year we spend $3.5 million, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| Let us know some positive things that are happening where you are able to save us some money and didn't spend everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| Yeah, I will, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Part of this contract also is to support, and I think we talked about this last month, the federal E-rate program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| where the federal government will reimburse us for certain expenditures, particularly around technology and infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| up to as much as about 80 cents on the dollar for certain infrastructure costs related to technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1926)|
| 0:32:14| And so we do anticipate, I think, that we made a commitment to about $2.5 million in spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1934)|
| 0:32:22| that would be related to this contract for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| But, again, I don't anticipate us approaching that $5 million threshold unless we do see additional resources forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1945)|
| 0:32:33| But I will absolutely come back if there's additional information to provide and success stories to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| I'll certainly be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Is it going to take five years to implement it in every school or is it sort of upgrades?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| Well, part of what our conversation last spring was about was what would it take to get to a place where we would have a robust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1965)|
| 0:32:52| wireless infrastructure in every school that could support a device for every teacher and every kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| Yeah, that would take probably four to five years to implement and put that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| It's a lot of work, a lot of wiring, a lot of back-end systems that have to be put in place in order to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| But, you know, we continue to do a lot of that work now in terms of making sure each of our schools has robust connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| We really only have the one school that has a robust wireless infrastructure that can support one-to-one devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=1996)|
| 0:33:23| and that's the L&N STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| But that's, you know, honestly, that's our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| You know, as I've said to many people, I think textbook manufacturers will stop making hardcover textbooks in this decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2008)|
| 0:33:36| We're going to be required to have our assessments, our state assessments online in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| We're going to have to prepare ourselves for the reality of the digital world in our public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| And so this, again, this contract just anticipates the likelihood of that reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| and we're hopeful that we'll see additional resources to be able to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| I just hope you can get more than five years of usage off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| But computers, I doubt that you will be able to, but I'm going to support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2045)|

| 0:34:08| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| We did have a motion and a second, so let's go ahead with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2054)|

| 0:34:25| The next item is on page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| It's item number 19, resolution 301.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| It's approving an amendment to the contract with Paytel Communications, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| for an inmate phone system for the Knox County Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| which amendment provides for the installation, management, and maintenance of a video visitation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| I could hear a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Yeah, I just wanted J.J. to just tell me a little bit more about how this works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| and how it's going to be set up and what kind of filtering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| and oversight there's going to be during these video chats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| And I just don't understand it as well as I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| I'm not opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| I just want to find out more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| I'm going to let my Alan Greaves band talk to you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| I'd rather talk to Allison anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2123)|

| 0:35:28| Allison Rogers, Knox County Sheriff's Office, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| Paytel is partnering with Tech Friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| They're going to put 45 kiosks in the pods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| and right now the inmates have to stand in line and wait on the pod officers to do any kind of correspondence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| Now there will be kiosks in the actual pod so they can all do it on their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| and they will be monitored by the pod officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2156)|

| 0:36:01| So there's going to be more activity taking place using these telecommunication links.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2161)|

| 0:36:08| And I was searching through the attachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| I had seen it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| There is a split, a guaranteed split, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| If this generates dollars, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| It should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Where do those dollars go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| We put them back into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| We get 43.75 percent of the revenue from these phone calls and it goes or phone calls, emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| it does go back into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2199)|

| 0:36:57| to collect donations for the Flu Miz program for the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2217)|

| 0:37:06| Any other discussion, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| Ms. Buchanan, Dr. Buchanan, would you like to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2231)|

| 0:37:25| Mr. Chairman, can I just throw a 15-second commercial in right here for the Metropolitan Drug Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| For the Flu Miz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| Well, not for the Flu Miz, but for the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| The Metropolitan Drug Commission right now is spearheading a forum that will be held hopefully around the end of November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2258)|
| 0:37:47| We'll have all law enforcement, all of the folks, health departments, the facilities that take care of all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2267)|
| 0:37:55| The focus is going to be on abuse of prescription drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| We'll have a great speaker coming in, and you'll hear more about it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| I just want to let you all know that there is a coalition coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| We've already had a couple of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| We have another one this Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| That will be trying to get this set up and invite all these folks in for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| Mike, could you be sure that that gets sent out to all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| Because this is something that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| It will be going to, you know, the hospitals, anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| I mean, be sure that we hear it and we get it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2307)|

| 0:38:35| The next item is on Page 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| It's Item Number 31, Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| It's authorizing and accepting the conveyance of three properties located at 2215 Shiptown Road, 280 South Peters Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2320)|
| 0:38:48| and 312 South Peters Road from Child and Family Services of Knox County, our current owner, to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2328)|
| 0:38:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Thank you, Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| I just didn't put this on consent just because it's in several districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| So would you speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| Hugh Hull, 1000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| These properties come to us from Child and Family Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| Grant Rosenberg was handling this, and obviously Grant's not with us anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| He's still alive, but he's taken another position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2355)|
| 0:39:23| And all these properties were basically deeded over to Child and Family to provide services for battered women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2363)|
| 0:39:31| They no longer have a use, and all these properties have reversionary clauses in the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| So, obviously, we have them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| And what I'm asking, I guess it is in the following resolution, is including those three properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| the Middlebrook Pike property that we leased, we didn't transfer to Child and Family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| is for the commission to tell me how you would like for me to dispose of those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| You're speaking to 802?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2401)|

| 0:40:17| And I want you to get credit for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| People have asked me, how did Child and Family Services get these properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| They were given to Child and Family Services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2428)|

| 0:40:45| It's resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| It's determining the method of disposal for four properties located at 2215 Shitetown Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| 280 South Peter's Road, 312 South Peter's Road, and 7215 Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2453)|
| 0:41:00| Okay, can I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| I'd like a motion to put a motion for auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Public auction is the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| We have a second and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| I notice that there is a fourth property added to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| In other words, there were three in this other item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| There is now a fourth property in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| Could you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Yes, that's the Middlebrook Pike property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| The county, for whatever reason, decided that that property wouldn't be transferred to child and family by quick claim deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2494)|
| 0:41:42| but only through a lease where they paid us a dollar a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| So that's why you don't have to approve the acceptance of the property in this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2505)|
| 0:41:53| So we, the county, have owned it all along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| All along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Is it to be offered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| If I look at the KGIS, I may be confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| Is it two parcels or is it a single parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| It is a single parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| But what I would recommend to the commission, and I was going to recommend public auction for these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2528)|
| 0:42:16| but I'd also recommend, and we're looking into that as we speak, is the subdividing of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| Have the lot on the corner of Francis and Middlebrook, which would be about a little over an acre and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2543)|
| 0:42:30| have that subdivided out, rezoned commercial, and then sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| That would leave about an acre or so with the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| I'd like to add that to my resolution, that subdivided, zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| Second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| Back a few years ago, Commissioner Smith should remember this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| but we did a redevelopment plan for Middlebrook Pike before all of the alterations and improvements were implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2578)|
| 0:43:16| And best of my recollection, there were some stipulations on how much commercial could be added on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2596)|
| 0:43:24| Do you not remember that, Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| Has this been maybe marked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| Is he still back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Can you shed some light on that mark as far as does this qualify before we stick our neck out here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2611)|
| 0:43:46| In regards to the Middlebrook Pike improvement plan, you know, the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2626)|
| 0:43:59| Mr. Donaldson, would you give your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| Mark Donaldson, Director of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| Yeah, the Middlebrook Pike Corridor Study predates me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| so I'm not familiar with it right off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| But I would suspect that a corner property at Francis and Middlebrook would be ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2652)|
| 0:44:19| would carry a land use classification to support commercial rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| I think that in the back of my mind it was something like only at major intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| wasn't that kind of what the qualifier was on it, Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Francis Road would be either a minor arterial or a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Other questions for Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| And we have our chosen method of disposal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| And that meets your recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Item number 33, Resolution 901,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| withholding disbursements to Knoxville Area Chamber Partnership, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| until requested financial disclosures are provided to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| And what I'll do here, I'll just introduce the topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| and then if it's okay with the Board, I will not relinquish the chair unless you ask me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2716)|
| 0:45:24| I'll just sit back and listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| Of course, my only thing to really say is that I think that this is an item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| which the public has a right to know, the taxpayers have a right to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| And so with that, I'll call on Mr. Edwards and his legal representative to speak to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2736)|
| 0:45:48| And then, of course, we'll follow with some of our law departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2748)|
| 0:45:55| He's going to give it to you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2755)|
| 0:46:16| I'm Tom McAdams, 4823 Old Kingston Pike, here on behalf of the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| We appreciate the opportunity to come before you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| and hopefully answer some of your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| and sort of explain what the Chamber is and what it isn't, how it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| what laws apply to disclosure of its records, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| The Chamber is a membership organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| It's been in existence for over 150 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| and for this is the 125th year that it's been known as the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2807)|
| 0:46:54| It has over 2,000 members, most of which are small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| Over 50 percent of its members have one to ten employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| Eighty percent of its members have 75 or fewer employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| So it is an organization whose mission is to represent the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| and to promote regional economic prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| The Chamber does that in a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| It has six primary areas of focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| One is new business recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| One is small business assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| One is startup business assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| It has programs for existing industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| It provides general public services, and it provides government services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| including services to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| The Chamber also has an affiliate known as the Partnership Initiatives Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| which carries out some activities of the Chamber that are charitable and educational in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| and are qualified for charitable deductions under the Internal Revenue Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| The Chamber itself is qualified under Section 501C6 of the Internal Revenue Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2884)|
| 0:48:12| That is a section of the Internal Revenue Code that provides a tax exemption specifically to Chambers of Commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2892)|
| 0:48:20| business leagues, trade associations, and other businesses of that type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| These organizations are exempt from taxes on their income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| but contributions to them are not charitable contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| When you think of charitable contributions, you're thinking of a 501C3 corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| which is a different type of corporation, different purpose, different requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| and qualified under a different section of the Internal Revenue Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| The Partnership Initiatives Fund is a 501C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| The laws applicable to 501C6 organizations and 501C3 organizations are different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2937)|
| 0:49:04| and we'll go through those in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| The Chamber is one of 45 organizations that have defined service agreements with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2948)|
| 0:49:19| If you'll look in your annual budget, you'll see a list of all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| The amount of funding that you provide to the Chamber is relatively low down the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| compared to some of the other organizations that also receive funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| many worthwhile organizations and it's something that you all approve annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| And the Chamber is on that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| What you – the funding you provide to the Chamber is not a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| It is not a gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| It is not an allocation of tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| It is a contract for services, and the Chamber provides services to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| It provides services under a similar agreement to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| and it's compensated for those agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| The Chamber has previously provided to each of you a copy of those defined services agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| called Memorandums of Understanding that spell out specifically the services the Chamber is to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3010)|
| 0:50:18| and what the county is to pay for those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| I will point out that the county has hundreds of contracts with people to provide services to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3022)|
| 0:50:32| many of them for millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| There were a dozen items on your agenda today involving about $4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| that are service contracts or purchase contracts with third parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| just like your contract with the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| It's a contract for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| In this case, the Chamber's activities include education and workforce development, entrepreneurship and technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3051)|
| 0:50:59| global marketing, business retention and expansion, public policy and resources for living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3059)|
| 0:51:07| And then there's an itemized list of what the county does for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| or what the Chamber does for Knox County in terms of economic recruitment and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| The Chamber is the marketing arm of Knox County in the sense that it is the organization that is taking the phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3077)|
| 0:51:26| It's the organization that goes to the national meetings, that puts up booths at appropriate shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| that advertises in appropriate publications, and that tries to attract new employers to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3091)|
| 0:51:38| The county's contribution to that effort is about $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| The Chamber's entire budget with the Partnership Initiatives Fund is about $3.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3103)|
| 0:51:50| Of that $3.6 million, almost $1 million goes directly into economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| So what the county is paying $80,000 for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| it's having the benefit of almost $1 million in expenditure by the Chamber directly related to economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3121)|
| 0:52:09| directly related to the types of services defined under the Defined Services Agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3129)|
| 0:52:16| The county's contribution, which is appreciated, is still given in partnership with the 2,000 member organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3136)|
| 0:52:27| who are funding the rest of that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| So it's the Knoxville business community and Knox County together that are funding economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| And the Knox County business community is funding over $800,000 of that expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3156)|
| 0:52:44| So that's kind of how it works and what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| And the county has a contract with the Chamber, with the 501c6 organization, to provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3168)|
| 0:53:00| The contract includes a provision related to the inspection of the Chamber's records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| And I think it's a fairly standard provision that's in most of your contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| And it says the county or any one of their authorized representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| shall have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| that are directly pertinent to this memorandum of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| The agency must provide the requested information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| and or make modifications in the information presented to comply with the county's requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| and must allow site visits by county representatives as deemed necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| to validate the results, outcomes of performance indicators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| And there are specific performance indicators of how you measure success in economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3232)|
| 0:53:59| So what the contract says is you can request copies of Chamber records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| that are directly pertinent to the economic development services that the Chamber provides to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3245)|
| 0:54:13| Those have been provided to the county on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| There is a quarterly report that's submitted to the county mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| and I believe another county department that itemizes the number of calls received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| the number of visits made, and it's a summary of the activities undertaken in the preceding quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| And those have been submitted regularly and copies of those were provided to you in July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| in response to Commissioner Norman's oral request at the June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3281)|
| 0:54:48| In addition, the payments are made quarterly, as you heard earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| and before the payment is made, the Chamber submits a draw request and it breaks down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| It's generally billed at $20,000 a quarter because the Chamber's expenditures far exceed that amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3299)|
| 0:55:06| but it's billed with a breakdown of the categories under the contract in which those services were provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3306)|
| 0:55:14| So the county gets a quarterly report of economic development activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| and a quarterly draw request with a breakdown of the requested funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| Those were also included in the package that was provided to you earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| The request that was made in June, the Chamber asked that it be made in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3329)|
| 0:55:37| and before that happened, the Chamber did go ahead and provide copies of those quarterly reports in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3337)|
| 0:55:45| After receiving the request, the Chamber sent each of you a follow-up letter in early August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3345)|
| 0:55:52| that included a copy of the Chamber's audited financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| And while the contract is not that broad, it doesn't entitle you to the Chamber's financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3357)|
| 0:56:04| They provided it and provided an audited copy from a reputable audit firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3364)|
| 0:56:11| That gives you a complete copy of the Chamber's balance sheet, its assets and liabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| and its revenues and expenses in the form required by generally accepted accounting principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3377)|
| 0:56:24| So the Chamber made full disclosure of all of its finances in the traditional form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| that's recognized by the financial institutions and by industry generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| and by the financial accounting standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| So that information has been provided to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| We then reviewed Commissioner Norman's request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| and I'll tell you frankly it was troublesome when we reviewed the request itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| The request is not directed to the Chamber's economic development activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| It did not request a single record related to economic development activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| It requested two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| It asked for records related to the Chamber's efforts in opposition to the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3433)|
| 0:57:23| and it asked for records related to the Chamber's efforts in support of an increase in the Knox County Schools budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3443)|
| 0:57:34| That's what it asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| Mr. McAdams, could I just interrupt just for a second just to clarify where we are in process for the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3455)|
| 0:57:44| The body asked for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| We're not acting right now under any motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| And so that's just where I want the body to realize where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3470)|
| 0:57:58| I'm not trying to abridge your discussion or your description of your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| Normally we hold to this five-minute thing and so on, but I did not do that at first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| And so you may continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| But after you're done with your description of your position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| we probably should entertain a motion of some type to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| So I just wanted to let you know where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| After the financial statements were provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| the resolution was introduced that I believe is what's on the agenda for this upcoming meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3516)|
| 0:58:45| And we reviewed the resolution in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| And Mr. Edwards, I think, just distributed a summary of the Chamber's detailed response to each paragraph of that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3531)|
| 0:59:05| And we disagree with virtually everything in the resolution as a factual matter, as a legal matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3545)|
| 0:59:13| and as to whether it's something appropriate for a county commission to even consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| The first paragraph was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| The Chamber is a nonprofit corporation, which receives taxpayer funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| That's not quite correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| It does get paid out of the county general budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| but it does not receive an allocation of taxpayer funds, unlike some organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| And when it says it is a nonprofit corporation, yes, it's a 501c6, not a 501c3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3577)|
| 0:59:45| The Chamber has a fiduciary duty to the county and its taxpayers with regard to the funds it receives from the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3585)|
| 0:59:53| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| The Chamber has a contractual duty to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| It entered into a contract with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| The Chamber has a fiduciary duty to its members, just like you have a fiduciary duty to your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3601)|
| 1:00:08| But that's not a fiduciary duty that the Chamber owes to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| That's a contractual duty under the terms of your contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3612)|
| 1:00:20| Next, the Chamber is required by the Internal Revenue Code to disclose its tax returns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| and other financial data to any individual upon request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| That is simply not the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| And to digress for just a minute, let me give you a quick overview of what the law is on disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3635)|
| 1:00:42| There's no law cited in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| There was no law cited at your previous minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| So we went out and reviewed every law that we could think of that was applicable to determine what are they required to disclose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3648)|
| 1:00:56| And the answer is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| 501c3 organizations and 501c6 organizations are required to disclose two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3658)|
| 1:01:06| One is their application for exemption from taxes, which the Chamber filed many, many, many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| And anybody who wants a copy is welcome to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| And the second is you are required to file your annual tax return, your Form 990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| except federal law specifically provides you are not required to disclose Schedule B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3682)|
| 1:01:29| You are not required to disclose contributors, names, addresses, and amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| And we've given you also a summary of the federal law that clearly delineates what's required, what's not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3696)|
| 1:01:48| Contributors, amounts, and addresses are not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| If you ask the IRS for a copy of the Chambers 990, they will give it to you without that schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3713)|
| 1:02:00| If you go to GuideStar and look at it, they will give it to you without that schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| That's because membership organizations and charities consider their donors and members to be a private matter, and it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3725)|
| 1:02:13| And federal law recognizes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| The Code of Federal Regulations confirms it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| We looked at state law, and what are the state law requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| Well, there's the Public Records Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| It's applicable to state, county, and municipal records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| It is not applicable to the Chamber's records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| The Chamber is not a governmental entity or agency under any stretch of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| So the Public Records Act does not apply to the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| There's the Charitable Solicitations Act that does require filings with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3763)|
| 1:02:49| but it does not apply to Chambers of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| It only applies to 501C3 charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| And even if it did apply, it doesn't require contributor names, addresses, and donation amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3775)|
| 1:03:03| It simply requires gross figures of how much you collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| Then there are campaign finance disclosure laws in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| but they do not apply to public information campaigns or to matters pending before bodies like county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3793)|
| 1:03:23| They only apply to election of public officials and to measures that are on the ballot to be voted on by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3803)|
| 1:03:33| Those two things you have to file a campaign financial disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3813)|
| 1:03:39| So those are the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| None of them require the Chamber to disclose these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| Your contract does not require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| Federal law does not require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| And state law does not require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| One of the reasons that it is troublesome is that counties can go too far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3835)|
| 1:04:02| and bodies can get themselves in trouble, and individuals can get themselves in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| Because there is a law that is applicable, and that is the First Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3848)|
| 1:04:15| And there are decisions of the United States Supreme Court that say that it is a civil rights violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3855)|
| 1:04:22| and a violation of someone's First Amendment rights for an elected official under color of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3862)|
| 1:04:30| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| I think we're getting off course here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| And I really know lawyers talk, to be quite honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| But I think we need to stick with the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| I think he's covered the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| I guess my question is how long are we going to allow this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| And I guess I'll ask that of Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| I don't know how we're going to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| Well, I'm still in the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| I'm not going to enter into the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| I guess I'm just asking how long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| Let's ask Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| How much longer do you need, Mr. McAdams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3913)|
| 1:05:14| But there was a case directly in point where a county had a contract with someone who was very involved in public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3914)|
| 1:05:22| and so on and highly critical of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| And the county commission said they were tired of dealing with him and voted to rescind his contract and not to make payments under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3926)|
| 1:05:35| And the Supreme Court held that was a violation of his civil rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| And it's just that if what the issue is is that the chamber lobbied, campaigned, ran a public education campaign against the Hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3940)|
| 1:05:51| and Ridgetop Protection Plan or in favor of the school's budget, that is not a legitimate basis for inquiry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3951)|
| 1:06:00| And that seems to be the root of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| So we're not trying to hide anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| We've made every disclosure that we know of that is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| And if the law department will cite us to some law that requires additional disclosure, we'll be happy to comply with that law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3969)|
| 1:06:16| but we're not aware of any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| So, you know, I hope the financial statements, the quarterly reports, the review of the contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| review of the law gives you a sufficient understanding that you realize the resolution is not appropriate and not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3985)|
| 1:06:36| And we hope you will turn it down if and when it comes before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| Okay, thank you, Mr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| Let's drop back right now to get in line with Robert's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| Do we hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| Can we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| I'd like to make a motion, Mr. Chairman, that we put this behind us, move forward, pay the bills as it's due,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4012)|
| 1:07:01| because the contract requirements have been fulfilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| And I think that the information that was requested was given, and we're losing business in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| Now, Mr. Brown, will you just make the motion and not argue the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| Just make your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| I'll come back with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| We have a motion to deny the resolution, the request for disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| Do we hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| Now, to that discussion, Mr. Brown, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4050)|
| 1:07:36| You know, this has been dragging on now for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4056)|
| 1:07:43| A while ago it was mentioned that the Knoxville Chamber has over 2,000 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4063)|
| 1:07:50| Businessmen, businesswomen who travel all over the world to conventions, to presentations, to whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4070)|
| 1:07:59| they all have, and I've been there, done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| You seek out people within your own business, so to speak, or your own area of business, so to speak, and you talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4082)|
| 1:08:16| Well, you know, I'm in Podunk, and I'm not getting along with the county commission there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| What's it like in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| I'd like to maybe move my business somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| This is a legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| We do not control the economic business impact that these 2,000 businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4110)|
| 1:08:40| plus all those that are not chamber members, have on this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| We're trying to hamstring them in going out here and doing the job they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| It's just if we can't get along, who would want to move here and open up a business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| I mean, that's what I'm getting at, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| We're not talking about a king's ransom here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| We're talking about what we've been doing for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| They've done a good job, and I submit to you that we need to continue to let them do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4144)|
| 1:09:11| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| I'd like to ask our law director, do you disagree with any of the documents that have been presented to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| I mean, do you have any response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| Well, one of the main positions that we're looking at here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| and I respect the positions being taken by the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| However, there are elements within the contract that we've had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| Some of the issues that they brought out, such as the 990 issue and Schedule B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| they have always presented that to us, and whether they want to keep it secret or not is totally up to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4186)|
| 1:09:53| but they've presented that type of information in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| We also have other clauses within the contract that could lead to a matter of disagreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| and looking at things a little differently than the way it's been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| This issue came up a little bit before my time sitting here in this chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| and if we want to get into the debate of the actual specifics of the position that Chairman Norman has made in his resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4213)|
| 1:10:21| and the law department's position on it, then I would have to defer to David Boot, my chief deputy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| because he's the one that's actually done the research on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| That's from the legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| However, from the contractual standpoint, we have elements within the contract that we could actually debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4234)|
| 1:10:42| So I guess, Mr. Boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| Yes, I disagree respectfully with several of Mr. McAdams' positions and statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4244)|
| 1:10:52| as well as this disclosure requirement that has been handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| I don't think they fairly and adequately cite the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| Mr. Adams, the bottom line on this and what started this is the taxpayers have a right to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4262)|
| 1:11:11| to whom they're giving money for whatever purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| You start with that premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| The taxpayers have a right to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| What gave rise to this was the hot issue on the school funding where people were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4279)|
| 1:11:25| why are we giving the chamber money to come in and support a 35-cent tax increase that I, as a property owner, don't want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4285)|
| 1:11:33| That's what triggered all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| Now, Mr. McAdams is correct under 501 or under 26 U.S.C. 6104| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4296)|
| 1:11:45| that the 990 need not have a listing of the contributors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| That is a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| However, as Mr. Armstrong has pointed out, they have done it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| And the memo that went out to you had a portion of the 990 that had the contributors in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| They're listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| Why now all of a sudden do they not want to list the contributors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| That's a political question, not a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| But they have done it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| Now, with regard to this item under state law, TCA Section 107503,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4333)|
| 1:12:21| which they say does not apply, only applies to municipal and county records, applies to non-profits in Section D1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4341)|
| 1:12:30| It clearly applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| And there's a requirement in there for disclosures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| Now, the question is how much in a way of disclosures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| With regard to the argument on audited financial statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| if you look at an audited financial statement and the notes thereon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| there's one purpose for an audited financial statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| and that is to determine whether or not management is mismanaging funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| That's basically all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| There are no itemized disbursements in an audited financial statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| I think in the ones that came out from the chamber and the partnership initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4380)|
| 1:13:07| and that, they're all bundled together into like maybe eight categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| And that's all you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| Now, what are they required to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| They did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| I take issue, Commissioner Brown, with what you said, that they fully disclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| This one page is all that has been disclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| What they do is every quarter, every quarter, they break down the 80,000 into 20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| and split it into three categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| Under the contract, they're required to supply invoices showing paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| and all kinds of other disbursement information to support this simple line item category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4421)|
| 1:13:48| For instance, 30-some-odd thousand goes to research data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4428)|
| 1:13:55| Well, who do they pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| Under the contract, they're required to give that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| They refuse to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| Under our code, under our procurement code, 2-282,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| it says the financial transactions of each public or private agency to which the county makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| miscellaneous appropriations shall be subject to audit by the Department of Internal Audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| And when a Department of Internal Audit, if it has a right to go in and audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| it can see every single disbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| It can see every single piece of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| So indirectly by our own procurement code that an agency, Mr. Walls or really anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4471)|
| 1:14:38| can go in there and get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| Why do they not want to itemize how these disbursements are made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| The public has a right to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| And I would submit that I disagree with Mr. McAdams' broad statement that the only fiduciary duty of the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4487)|
| 1:14:56| is to its members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| Under federal law 501C3, C6, under state law for non-profit corporations, there's a duty to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4498)|
| 1:15:09| That's how they get non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| They have a duty to the public because they are expending these funds for the public benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| So to that extent, I disagree very strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| And you get back to the basic public policy premise that taxpayers have a right to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4519)|
| 1:15:26| So we're talking about $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| That's what I understand, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| So the $80,000 that Knox County gives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| So, Mr. Edwards, may I ask a couple of questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| Were any taxpayer dollars used to finance these campaigns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| So the $80,000, Mr. Buch is suggesting that you're refusing to give invoices and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4544)|
| 1:15:51| How would you respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| We're not refusing to give any invoice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| In fact, we acknowledge the fact that the county can come quarterly, review our books, go through all the expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4555)|
| 1:16:05| Mr. Edwards, Mr. Edwards, please state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| Michael Edwards, Market Square 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| We're not saying that you're not entitled to know every invoice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| What we're saying is it's restricted to that is germane to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| It is the same as if you were to go to AT&T, of which you have a contract with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| and say, show us your books because we know you lobby a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| And your lobbying may have something to do that we don't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| It is, as Mr. McAdams said, it is a contract for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| You're not giving us money to go do good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| You're telling us we're buying marketing and economic development services from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| and because of that you have the right to review how we spend that money and in performance measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4618)|
| 1:17:05| You can go to the office and look at the receipts and how we've spent that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4625)|
| 1:17:13| The reason we're asking for a $20,000 reimbursement is because we have spent far beyond that $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4633)|
| 1:17:22| And when you're looking at whether or not we spent money in regard to actually it was published in the newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4642)|
| 1:17:36| the PV spots on the school deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| But as long as you all understand we have spent your money in excess of that for that which you've contracted for us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4662)|
| 1:17:52| and we can show you that, what happens in the other part of the house is not germane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4672)|
| 1:18:01| Is it possible for us to have Mr. Walls come over and look at those records as our designated representative between now and Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4681)|
| 1:18:10| Just the $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| I'm not talking about the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| I'm talking about the $80,000 we've agreed on that is taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| You have that contractual right any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| Mr. Walls says he can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| So I would like to add a friendly amendment that we ask Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| Well, I'd like to see what Mr. Walls finds out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| So I guess my substitute motion would be that we ask Mr. Walls to go and review these records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| and bring us the documentation at our meeting on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| I'm sorry, but point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| I believe that all requests made to Mr. Walls have to go through the audit committee, not from directly from a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4720)|
| 1:18:49| Ed and Dave, is that not how you all understand how it works now that we have an audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4729)|
| 1:18:56| I think the chairman can ask for that at any time he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| I think what was just stated was an individual commissioner not directing the internal audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4743)|
| 1:19:10| But we sitting as commission can decide that, I think, today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| So that would be my substitute motion is that we go ahead and ask Mr. Walls to go over this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| and provide us with his information so Monday we'll have it and we can hopefully make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| That would be my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| We need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| Discussion now to that substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| Mr. Walls, would you like to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| The three big issues that have come up with the chamber since I've been on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4780)|
| 1:19:48| and that I remember are Midway and Hillside Ridge Top and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| And I was not in agreement with the chamber on two of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| And in agreement was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| In fact, one of them I felt very strongly that the chamber was spreading some erroneous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| and inflammatory information, and I was not at all happy about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| But I remembered at the time that we just went over this entire issue just a year ago with Beck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4809)|
| 1:20:18| when we were deciding whether or not we were going to give Beck money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| And it was made very, very, very clear to us as a body at that time that the only rights we had to look at money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4821)|
| 1:20:29| was money that was spent by Beck, was money that we gave them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| We had no right to look at any of their other finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| Now, we could decide whether or not we wanted to give Beck money based on how we thought they were doing with the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4839)|
| 1:20:46| of their money or what kind of program, whether or not we agreed with the programs they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| And we still have the right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| If you don't like what the chambers does, vote not to give them any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| You know, there's been organizations that the county has given money to that I don't like what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4856)|
| 1:21:03| and I vote not to give them any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| That is our right as commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| And you can try really hard to get five other people to vote with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| Sometimes you're successful, sometimes you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| But I feel like this is asking for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| It's overreaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| We just went through this a year ago, and it was made very, very clear to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| We can ask for an audit of money we give them, but not any other monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| And I disagree on whether we as a body can ask the internal or can direct the internal auditor to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4888)|
| 1:21:39| My understanding is that, and this is why we have an audit committee, is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4899)|
| 1:21:45| and perhaps the law director can look that up and verify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| My understanding is that suggestions or requests from the commission go to the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4908)|
| 1:21:55| and then they make that request of the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| So, but if you would, and I could be wrong, and I'm not afraid to say so if I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| I believe we directed them on Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| I don't think that went through the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| No, I think it did, because I remember that those audits came, that audit came through the audit committee first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4928)|
| 1:22:15| But regardless, this is, I may not always like what the chamber does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4935)|
| 1:22:22| but what this boils down to is that we don't have a right to ask to see how they spend the rest of their money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| only the money that we give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| And if you don't like the way that they spend their private funds, don't vote to give them any public funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4949)|
| 1:22:37| That's pretty much it, simplified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| Now, I just want to remind the body that we're acting under the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| to deny the disclosure with a friendly amendment from that includes a request of Mr. Walsh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4967)|
| 1:22:54| to go and review this ADK between now and Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| That's where we are in terms of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| Mr. Chairman, my substitute motion was not to approve or deny the expenditure, but merely to ask Mr. Walsh to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| You want no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Yes, there's no recommendation until we get his information, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| Ms. Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| Well, if that, do you have a scope for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| We need to know exactly what it is that you want him to do between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| Do you want a full-blown audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| Do you, what is the scope of what you're asking him to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| Yeah, he has $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| He goes over and looks at the expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| And I don't guess they've gotten $80,000 yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| It's whatever they've gotten so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| And they have the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| So you're asking for him to do an audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| How much money have you all gotten so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| I guess you've gotten any this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| You can only look at what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| Mr. Hammond still has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| Yes, I'm just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| Chris, you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| Yeah, in reference to what Commissioner Bowles is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| I do believe, if it's not a rule, it's preference that everything that you all recommend goes to the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5047)|
| 1:24:14| Because I think it's the Audit Committee, which would be Commissioner Shouse and Commissioner Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| and Commissioner Browles and the two people on the Audit Committee that set forth the direction of Richard Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5059)|
| 1:24:27| I think because what was happening was there was everybody was saying Richard do this or do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| So this gives him some sort of direction and some sort of path to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| And they say what is most important to least important, what he should be working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| So I think if there's not a rule, there's for sure I think a president said that it should go probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5082)|
| 1:24:49| through the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| That's just my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| That's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| Well, it says that a designated representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| So if we can't do Mr. Walls, we could send a designated representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| I don't think it would take that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| I mean, I don't think we're looking at days and hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| I think you're probably looking at somebody go over and spend a couple hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| and they've got the receipts and everything, they're going to present them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| and I think you can see if they match up or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| So I don't know that it's, you know, we're not talking about days and weeks and months of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| That's what I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| And, Richard, I would ask you, what's your understanding of how your direction comes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5118)|
| 1:25:30| Basically, I think the understanding is it does come through the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| You know, however, you know, I would take direction, you know, from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| I guess I'm in favor of what, that's why I second the Commissioner Hammond's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5147)|
| 1:25:57| But I guess I'm trying to figure out what we're going to have them look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| I agree, it won't take a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| But what I think, because I do agree with Mr. Buchan that the statement that they gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5163)|
| 1:26:11| I guess that's last year, that must be FY12's report, you know, $30,000 for research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5171)|
| 1:26:21| We need a little more detail than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| We deserve a little more detail than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| So I guess what I'm trying to understand is what are they going to be looking at between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5186)|
| 1:26:33| and Monday because they may not have enough receipts for anyone to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| You know, we're in the first quarter of our fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5199)|
| 1:26:46| So I'm looking to Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| Would you want them to take a look at maybe last year's ADK or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| That's what I'm thinking is last year's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| I don't think that's going to be an all-day affair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| However, it needs to be some detail because we should be able to dig into that ADK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| I tend to agree with Mr. McAdams in that, you know, things outside of that, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| But I think we have every right to dig as far in that ADK as we deem fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5232)|
| 1:27:18| So that's so if you're okay with that, that's what I would suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5238)|
| 1:27:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| Just a couple of quick points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| We have a contract with PILOT to provide gas for the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| Is that right, J.J.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| So we pay them probably close to half a million dollars a year for fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| And if PILOT decides they want to push for $35 million for schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| and vote against the hillside development, it ain't none of our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| That's point blank what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| We're talking about people who are out here, the ambassadors for our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5280)|
| 1:28:06| who are trying to bring business into our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| And we're trying to hamstring them by stringing them along and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| you don't play in our sandbox unless you use my shovel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| That's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| Going along with, I guess, what Commissioner McKenzie said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| would we pay them any money if they didn't provide us adequate documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| Have they ever not provided adequate documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| That wasn't under my purview in the previous years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| but it's my understanding from the people who are responsible for it that the chamber had provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| all the documentation that was requested of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| Ms. Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| And this goes back to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| I am --I was intending to vote against the original resolution based on what we've been through before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5339)|
| 1:29:07| As it, like I said a year ago when we went through this with Beck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| I don't think we have the right to request those records and was on the chamber's side on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5351)|
| 1:29:18| And if I was reading the table right, I think everybody else was pretty much at the same position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| But I have a real problem with bypassing the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5363)|
| 1:29:29| The committee is there for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| And one of the reasons that we have the audit committee is so that the internal auditor cannot be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5371)|
| 1:29:38| in political situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| And the other thing that the audit committee does that's very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| very important and that we seem to really be struggling with right now is setting the scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| and the parameters of the work that the internal auditor does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| And right now we're just saying, go look at these receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| And I'm very, very uncomfortable with just something that loosey-goosey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5399)|
| 1:30:05| and also sidestepping procedure that this body is supposed to respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| So on the original motion to deny this, I would have voted for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5411)|
| 1:30:17| But I will not vote in favor of circumventing the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| and not giving clear, concise parameters and steps to our internal auditor of what it is that we expect him to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5421)|
| 1:30:32| I think that is inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| So I'm going to vote against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| But I'll be happy to vote for the original substitute motion, which was to deny this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5437)|
| 1:30:45| I hope that I've made that clear as mud for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| Yeah, Mr. Chairman, we've heard from the Deputy Law Director today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| and he seems to have an awful lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| In fact, I think it would behoove us if he goes with Mr. Walz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| That way he's satisfied in his mind so he can report back to us at the meeting along with Rich Walz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5461)|
| 1:31:08| because he knows what questions, per se, that he wants to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5468)|
| 1:31:15| If he'd be willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| Mr. Buch, is there a problem with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| I will do whatever this body instructs me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| I will be more than happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| Okay, then that is, is that necessary to amend the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5483)|
| 1:31:33| If the maker of the motion, is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| Is that acceptable to have Mr. Buch attend with Mr. Walz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| Well, I don't want to circumvent the audit committee either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| but I don't want to go on another month or two with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| I don't think it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| I think they've got the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| They have said they're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| Anybody, an authorized representative can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| If it's not Mr. Walz, I'd like to ask Mr. Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| if there is an authorized representative we could send from the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| who would know and could go over and check those records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| and make sure that the $80,000 was spent properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| and look at the invoices, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| Sorry, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5534)|
| 1:32:24| And remember, Chris, you wanted this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| But you look very nice in that shirt today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| And, Mr. Caldwell, I tried to get them to put this off until October, but they wouldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| What's the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| What we're looking for is I'd like to get something done on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| so that it's not lingering another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| They say they have the records there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| An authorized representative can go look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| I don't think that we're looking at a multi-day task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| I mean, it just seems to me that no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| Do you have someone in your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| or could you recommend someone that would be an authorized representative from this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| to go over and look at those records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| I don't want to bypass our procedure either because, as I recall, you know, I'm getting older now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| My memory is not what it used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| However, I think I was the one that maybe sponsored that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| So I don't want to go against our protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| But if we have an authorized representative from your office that is qualified to go over and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| I think we could do it and get this done very quickly and just look at last year's $80,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| and let, you know, look at those expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| We can do that, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| Then I will amend my motion to say that we would send an authorized representative from the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| to look at those records and report back to us on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| Is that okay with McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5623)|
| 1:33:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| Accepted by the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| And the scope would be, it would be the $80,000 because they haven't gotten any money from this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| So it would be last year's $80,000 and you will report back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| And if there's any discrepancies, you'll let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| If everything is clean, you'll let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| But you'll have a report either by Monday or before Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| Just to be sure that we're not drifting on our string on what we're looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| is that we're not suspecting any sort of misappropriation of the $80,000 that we gave last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| And we want what we want, I think, for them to focus on is to see if any of that money was spent for lobbying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| I mean, that's what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| It's not, you know, we're not looking for anything else as far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| That's the point I'm trying to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| I think most of my questions have been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| It's only the $80,000, nothing to do with Innovation Valley money, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| And Commissioner Boyle's points are very well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| There was, I think, the years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| Mr. Wall's order was there was much more political infighting in this building, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| than the finance chair and the intergovernment chair versus the mayor and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| That's why it was run through the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| If the Audit Committee had to do it, it would be January before we got it back, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| because looking back, it took three, four, five months before we got it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| So this is probably the best way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| That's a good way to, if Christian has the people to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| And it had nothing to do with the, as I think Mr. Edwards said, the money that was raised privately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5718)|
| 1:35:25| individuals, their names were in the paper, nothing to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| Just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| Mike, I want to just mention to the chairman, I believe in what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| the mission statement that you're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| But, you know, we represent the people and the people behind us and where that money comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| So we're just trying to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| I appreciate that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| And please hear what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| We believe without any qualification that how you spend money contractually with us, you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5752)|
| 1:36:01| you do have a fiduciary responsibility to know exactly how those dollars are spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5761)|
| 1:36:07| And we never have believed anything different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| We want you to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| We want you to be comfortable in how we are executing our contract with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5771)|
| 1:36:18| It's everything else under the universe that started to become problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5778)|
| 1:36:25| My gut tells me he's not going to find anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| So we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| Thank you, Mr. Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| Commissioner Broyles, I think you find that not only did Dr. Briggs agree with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| or Ed Schaust, or even to some extent there, my fellow sit-on-the-corner guy used to be over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5799)|
| 1:36:47| But I agree with you in that it's only about the $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| But the next thing that's before us before we vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| the thing that we've got to consider is the chamber may be the only organization that can do the job for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5814)|
| 1:37:00| because as we are a public, sun-shined organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| you'll notice in some of the conversation we've had here that the chamber is providing a service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5826)|
| 1:37:13| which I hate to look at it this way, but it's not sun-shined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| So I only say that because it's something we'll have to look at when we talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5837)|
| 1:37:23| do we want to maintain the status quo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| The status quo being significantly less than what we may have done in three or four years gone by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5845)|
| 1:37:35| But the chamber still has to fill a vacuum here between businesses coming to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5855)|
| 1:37:41| and how do they deal with the administration on the sixth floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5861)|
| 1:37:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| So we have a motion before us is to send on without recommendation with the caveat that Richard Walls and a designated person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5871)|
| 1:38:03| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| Not Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| Just finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| Just finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| Not audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| Richard can't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| I must have been talking while that part went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| So just finance as the designee to review the records of expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5891)|
| 1:38:17| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| That was an easy one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| I have a request for a recess for five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5911)|
| 1:38:32| Madam Clerk, will you go ahead next item, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| The next item is on page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| It's item number 37, resolution 905, requests in the Knox County Finance Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5916)|
| 1:38:42| to provide a quarterly report to the Knox County Commission detailing Knox County's revenues and expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5922)|
| 1:38:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| Mr. Hammond, would you like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| We probably need a motion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| Let's have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| I'll make a motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| Go ahead, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| This might be a good time to go ahead if you want to talk about expenditures and revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5942)|
| 1:39:08| and so forth and where we are at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| I guess my point is that I would like to have a more formal reporting process from our finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| with regards to where we are with our revenues and our expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| As you know, as we are the Board of Directors, all Board of Directors will receive these economic forecasts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5961)|
| 1:39:28| I would like to have them done verbally as well as any handouts that they may have for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5968)|
| 1:39:35| And one of the things that I want to point out is that by getting this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| and this information is extremely valuable for us as we look at what our projects are going to be for the next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| as we're looking at budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| But not only during budget time, I think it's important that we know what's going on on a quarterly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| so that we can keep our attention span on what is going on with our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5992)|
| 1:39:58| For example, I received yesterday a report, a preliminary report, on our sales tax revenues for last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=5998)|
| 1:40:09| And we are going to be approximately $950,000 behind last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6009)|
| 1:40:16| And so when you look at the first two months of our fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| we are already $1 million behind in sales tax revenues in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6019)|
| 1:40:25| I also pass this around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| This is information about Knoxville number of hotel rooms year from January through July of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6029)|
| 1:40:39| and also the Knoxville hotel occupancy rate from January through July of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| And as you can see, the numbers are behind 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| As a matter of fact, Dr. Steve Morse, the economist at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| is calling this a slow summer for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| Well, I pass this around because, number one, I wanted you to see the figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| But number two, I wanted you to know I got this from Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| I did not get this from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| I'm very involved in Sevier County and their tourism and what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| And I saw this report and I thought, this is information that we as the Knox County Commission need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| because it not only affects hotel-motel tax, it also affects, if we're having a slow summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6081)|
| 1:41:28| it's going to affect food because people are not going to be buying as much in restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| It's also going to affect retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| It's going to affect a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| So this is why I think it's important for us to get it on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| not just at budget time, so we can kind of keep tabs on what's going on in our economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| because we need to know if our revenues are up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| So that's why I'm asking for a report on a quarterly basis or if we need to do it monthly, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6108)|
| 1:41:55| I just want us to be in touch with what's going on with our economy and be able to get these figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6115)|
| 1:42:00| And I plan on contacting Dr. Morse and say, hey, we'd like to have this sent to the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6120)|
| 1:42:06| and not just over to Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| I'm sure they got it because they asked for it, and I'm sure we can get it if we ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| So that's why I'm asking for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| Mr. Caldwell, we've heard rumors that our coffers are overflowing with gold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| and you might wish to speak to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| So please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| I would like to first talk about the sales tax analysis that was passed out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| And just go over in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| Let me tell you, I got this wonderful spreadsheet from Ron McPherson at schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6154)|
| 1:42:39| I'll give credit to Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| And we have it implemented in ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| and it basically lets you look at about anything if you want to put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| But sales tax from a different standpoint as far as trend analysis goes, there's three pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6167)|
| 1:42:55| One's general fund, one's engineering public works, one is general purpose schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| But if you look at the bottom box on your left, that is our trend as far as a surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6180)|
| 1:43:09| or a deficit as it relates to sales tax and those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| And you will see that no matter how you look at it, you'll probably see a lot of negatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6194)|
| 1:43:22| This is basically based on one month of sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| We got July's end, which for us, I mean, the state report will say that it's August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6205)|
| 1:43:33| but we know it's July sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| It's the August report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| So this is our first month of sales tax in the new fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| And like Commissioner Hammond said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| we're $945,000 down from the same month of the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6224)|
| 1:43:50| So that's a little concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| And the last month we were down as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| We're not as severe as we are this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| And so what you will see is you'll see about five different types of trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6238)|
| 1:44:03| There's a weighted average trend, a prior year trend, a 12-year average trend, a conservative trend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6243)|
| 1:44:09| which we'll show you that is the worst that it could possibly be, we think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| and a composite trend, which is basically just an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| Probably the best one to look at, I would think, would be the 12-year average trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| It gives you the most information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| So if you look at the 12-year average trend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| the general fund is projected to be about $460,000 short of budget in fiscal year 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6268)|
| 1:44:37| Engineering and Public Works would be about $76,000 short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| And schools, about $2.1 million short of budget for sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6281)|
| 1:44:48| You know, we had some conversations during the budget of whether we should bump up our revenue some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6288)|
| 1:44:54| We kind of held down a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| And we can pass these out every month to you as we get the sales tax information in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6296)|
| 1:45:04| And we can track it as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| We will be watching it, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| Not reason to panic yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| We don't just get sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| We get a number of revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| I've always said that what helps us a lot is our delinquent property tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| That helps us tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| And hopefully those will continue to come in like they have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6325)|
| 1:45:31| If you have any type of questions, I'll answer those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| And I point this out because as you get into the designation slash commitments, and I have a few that I'll bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6333)|
| 1:45:42| But as you get into these, if you are talking about recurring expenditures, this has a bearing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6342)|
| 1:45:51| Because if sales tax continues to slide, then that's not a good trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| And it's going to hurt us as we budget for 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| So as we look to spend some of our surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6359)|
| 1:46:05| we need to try to make sure that it's for one-time expenditures, not recurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| and make sure that it's in our best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6370)|
| 1:46:15| And we need to track these trends, and we'll continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6380)|
| 1:46:21| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| Ms. Hammond, do you have more for Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| Ms. Rawls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| I appreciate this, and I agree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| and actually would like to add my name as a sponsor if that's okay with Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6391)|
| 1:46:42| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| You know, I agree with everything you said, Chris, in that, you know, not to go crazy over these numbers, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6405)|
| 1:46:55| but I distinctly remember sitting here looking at positive sales tax a year or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6415)|
| 1:47:03| Well, don't start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| It's not going to be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| You know, don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| That's just a one-year thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| Or this is a good month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| Things go down in that month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| And so that's why I support, also support this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6433)|
| 1:47:21| I guess, you know, numbers are always interesting, and you put a bunch of them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6441)|
| 1:47:29| You can look at a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| And I guess I would say we probably need to move out fairly cautiously with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6452)|
| 1:47:40| because if August is bad with, you know, July numbers and September is bad with August numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6460)|
| 1:47:48| that to me is, you know, something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| Well, as you say, over the period of time is where we need to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| I guess one of my problems, though, with this budgetary process is that we sounded like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6476)|
| 1:48:03| because I know I kept asking the questions along the way, where are we, where are we, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6483)|
| 1:48:10| And we really didn't get an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| So now, you know, there's this, oh, they're just wanting to hurry up and spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| We've been asking these questions a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| And somehow we have to get a better gauge earlier in the year or late in the FY, let me say it that way, about where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6500)|
| 1:48:32| It really can't be, well, we've got to wait until all the numbers come in, because that's kind of where it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| June, well, let's wait until July numbers in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| I mean, let's wait until year-end numbers are in in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| And then we had a similar conversation in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| So now there's this appearance that commissions out here wanting to just rush out and spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6525)|
| 1:48:51| And that's really not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| We were just holding back, waiting on the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| Because there was no data, no confident data, I guess I'll say that, until the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6534)|
| 1:49:01| And then so that's why the rush, I think, has been created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| So somehow we're going to have to be able to look back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| Okay, so delinquent tax rate has been this for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| So we can make some assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| This worst-case conservative disguise following model that we're taking, it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6555)|
| 1:49:22| But we can't always use that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| We kind of have to look at some trends and some back things and assume that some of these unstable funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6565)|
| 1:49:34| and I understand that delinquent tax rate is a fairly unstable process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6574)|
| 1:49:41| I do understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| I understand that sales tax is highly flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| But that's the economy we in Tennessee have chosen to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| I mean, that's what our state operates on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| So we have to take those unstable funds and manage it somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| But we can't shut down and then go spend crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| Because you may end up not getting some efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| So I guess what I'm asking is that somehow we start to get comfortable with where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6604)|
| 1:50:12| and make some better assumptions, maybe not as conservative or dire as we're comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6612)|
| 1:50:22| but to give us an idea of how to move out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| Because this, I mean, we've got a lot of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| We've got a lot of, you know, additions to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| And it's nobody's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| But it's not commission's fault because we're just now getting an opportunity to have this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6635)|
| 1:50:41| And if I can respond, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| If we were to take a more conservative trend in sales tax, to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6643)|
| 1:50:50| we may not be looking at a deficit in 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| And I would point out, too, that after one month of sales tax in FY12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6655)|
| 1:51:01| this spreadsheet showed that sales tax would have come in about $9 million higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| And it was about spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| So it's pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| And getting back to the surplus, and I apologize if you're on the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| because you've heard this once, but I'm going to repeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| To say that we were dishonest on talking about a surplus just isn't factual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6677)|
| 1:51:25| There were three things that hit in June and July that we really did not expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| We said we would do the reading program because we thought we had the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| We thought we'd have to come up with a 1.5 from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| And I said that we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| And then I said, that's about all that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| We can't do much else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| And three things happened that caused the surplus, and I'll go over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6704)|
| 1:51:49| We have budgeted $1.5 million for the haul income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| You can't forecast haul income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| It comes in once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| It came in at $2.85 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| That's $1.35 million more than we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| We anticipated two expenditures that did not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| One was a $750,000 infusion into our health insurance fund that we didn't have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6728)|
| 1:52:14| Because we did a better job with health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| It's not that we did a better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| It's that collections from our provider was lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6740)|
| 1:52:27| And sheriff's fuel, they came to us in March and said, hey, we're running short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| We're going to be about $250,000 short on fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| What can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| And I said, listen, we can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| It's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| It ended up they got they were able to correct their own deficit with salary savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6760)|
| 1:52:48| So if you take the health insurance and the sheriff's fuel and the haul income tax and you flip them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6768)|
| 1:52:54| we don't have a surplus, we break even, and we don't have this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6774)|
| 1:53:00| So point being is we have three items that caused us to have a surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6780)|
| 1:53:08| We don't know what haul income tax is going to be until the middle of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6788)|
| 1:53:13| Health insurance, since we've been self-insured, we have had to add money about every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| As we know, fuel spiked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| And so my point is that to think we were hiding stuff or pulling back just isn't true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6802)|
| 1:53:28| It's just some things happened that were out of our control and, thankfully, they were to the positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6808)|
| 1:53:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| Just by the way, Chris, in terms of sales tax revenues in the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| do we have any reason for that vis-à-vis the hailstorm and insurance grant, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6819)|
| 1:53:49| that people were able to absorb and spend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| Do we know whether things like that happened and that's an artificial bump in sales tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| There was two things in sales tax that we think could have caused the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6838)|
| 1:54:03| One, of course, was the hailstorms that we had happened in Knox County and that we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6843)|
| 1:54:09| We think that contractors went and bought their materials and that caused a spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6849)|
| 1:54:15| Another thing was we were getting a correction from the state for 12 months of about $126,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6855)|
| 1:54:21| that was coming to us from the city on a correction from a couple of businesses over a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6861)|
| 1:54:30| But I will tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6870)|
| 1:54:31| I get asked this all the time about what detail do we get from the state as far as sales tax goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6871)|
| 1:54:37| It's one page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| It tells you the total, and it tells you whether it's Knox County, the city of Knoxville, or the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6879)|
| 1:54:45| That's all we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| We don't get what sector or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| It's just one page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6891)|
| 1:54:52| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| Chris, do you take in a win-or-lose season for UT football?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6893)|
| 1:54:56| I refuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6896)|
| 1:54:57| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6897)|
| 1:54:58| I'm not going to take any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| Yeah, I mean, that's, you know, that affects us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| You know, Tennessee's winning the games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6903)|
| 1:55:04| I mean, there's another 20,000 people eating at restaurants and staying in hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| But I know that's not your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| But it does help the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| I would just say that this spreadsheet that we're using, if you look at one month of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6912)|
| 1:55:18| just the first month, it projected what the trend is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6918)|
| 1:55:23| And it projected what the surplus was going to be kind of close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| I mean, it's not going to be exact, but it's going to be fairly close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| Chris, with regards to health insurance, we won't know until the end of the year what our health insurance looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6933)|
| 1:55:39| in terms of whether we have add money or I mean is there any way of getting that information before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6939)|
| 1:55:45| We track trends like we do with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| What we do is every pay period we put revenue into our health insurance plan and every week claims are pulled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6948)|
| 1:55:59| And so the lady who handles health insurance for us, her name is Patty Galvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6959)|
| 1:56:04| She does an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| And we were trending to using between $300,000 and $750,000 because our claims were high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6965)|
| 1:56:14| The last three weeks in June, claims went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| And then we actually got an extra payroll that we wasn't counting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6977)|
| 1:56:22| Actually, we got to put into June that we thought was going to go into July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| And so it was kind of a misstep on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| But it was good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6989)|
| 1:56:30| And that's the first year that I can recall since we've been self-insured that we've added money to the health insurance fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=6990)|
| 1:56:40| And I would say it needs to be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7000)|
| 1:56:41| We've got about a week of fund balance built up in our health insurance fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7001)|
| 1:56:47| And I think that needs to probably be at least a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| And the whole income tax, that's a state deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| We won't know until mid-July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| So our budget year goes in July 1 and that could we just have to project what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7015)|
| 1:57:00| Now, what about BEP money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| Is that done yearly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| Is that done quarterly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| How is that done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| I'll tell you what I think and what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| If I'm wrong, I'll defer to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| But I think schools gets a BEP projection to start the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7031)|
| 1:57:16| And they get quarterly payments, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| Monthly payments, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| They get monthly payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| And then I think at the end of FY12 this year they got a bigger payment than they were expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7044)|
| 1:57:30| Now, that could have been because sales tax was higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| I don't know what the state does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| But we get that in monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| And sometimes it's better than we expect and that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| So we would have access to those figures you're saying on a monthly basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| And we can give that to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7065)|
| 1:57:46| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7069)|
| 1:57:50| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7070)|
| 1:57:51| The 24 million that we've heard talk about and we've seen a lot of headlines on it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| in reality after it trickles down, two-thirds go to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| And I compliment them on what appears to be the way they're spending it, mainly one-time deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7079)|
| 1:58:05| Shannondale, Pongap, Farragut, and not hiring people and other programs which come back each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7085)|
| 1:58:14| And with the trickle down, it's what, less than three million, isn't it, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| 2.9 currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| 2.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| And this 950,000 shortfall came out at the city's county's investment meeting Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7100)|
| 1:58:28| I guess it got e-mailed to us later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| That's very disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| And that shows it probably was a bubble off the stuff, the April and June storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7110)|
| 1:58:37| And he initially, I think, I guess you all got this, against a benchmark year, that being 2007, it was 800,000 down from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7117)|
| 1:58:45| That's prior recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| The haul income, who I'm sure some of us get dividends, they certainly haven't increased by 40 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7128)|
| 1:58:53| but yet the haul income tax, which is on the dividends, increased 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| That's just a phenomenon, as I can understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| 2.8 when you were expecting 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| And, I mean, there's no, I don't think Chris or John Troyer, who was running the show, intentionally low-balled or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7144)|
| 1:59:12| I mean, that's a good play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| I would certainly rather be on the lower end than have projected 2 million more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7154)|
| 1:59:20| And what Larry said, I was going to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| That definitely, that's tens of thousands of beds that will not be filled going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| I mean, if we would have gone into Alabama game five and O, I mean, we'd be selling out everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| But that's, I mean, that probably equates bottom line, hotel-motel and sales tax to millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7174)|
| 1:59:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| And I'd like to reiterate what Dr. Carsello said in summary of his view of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7182)|
| 1:59:48| And he's certainly an authority on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| And that is that what the finance department really represents is very prudent fiscal management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7190)|
| 1:59:57| That was his summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| So I'd like to compliment him on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| We have the resolution before us as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| So all in favor of this quarterly report say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7204)|
| 2:00:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7210)|
| 2:00:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7211)|

| 2:03:34| Thank you, Madam Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| You did that flawlessly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7415)|
| 2:03:40| I think most all of these are in reference to standardizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7420)|
| 2:03:44| Roy Braden, would you like to just give us a little rundown on this quickly, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7424)|
| 2:03:51| And let's have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7433)|
| 2:03:54| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7434)|
| 2:03:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7437)|
| 2:03:58| Roy Braden, 400 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7438)|
| 2:04:03| Before you is one of the major code updates that we will have or ever have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7443)|
| 2:04:09| In that, we go to the 2012 International Code or Family of Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| It will allow us to retain our ISO rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7454)|
| 2:04:19| And that's one of the big drivers of this because the rating would go down to significant low numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7459)|
| 2:04:26| which would be a 9 or a 10, which 10 being the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| Also in this is the International Property Maintenance Code where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| with the help of the Law Department, Daniel Sanders and Jill Rosberg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| we have combined five ordinances to put together all the code enforcement issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7478)|
| 2:04:45| All of this will be done under this one ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| So any time my inspectors would cite or anything, it would be under one ordinance number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7487)|
| 2:04:54| instead of about 10 different ordinance numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| So it's a big day for me and for the codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| And we're trying to lead the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| We've had 15 or 20 meetings with the ABC, the AGC, AIA, the Home Builders Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7503)|

| 2:05:16| Thank you, Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| Thank you for all your work you've done on this and getting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| We hope it's helpful to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| Question, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| Roy, is there anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| I see we've got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| We also have fire and we also have stormwater here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| Is there anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| I know this is mostly housekeeping, but is there any major change in any of these that you would like to maybe make us aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7536)|
| 2:05:44| Is there any big variation from past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7544)|
| 2:05:48| I don't think there's a big variation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| There are changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| In the residential code alone, there was 600 amendments from six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7551)|
| 2:05:57| That's why we had quite a few meetings with the Home Builders Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| And we only out of 600 and something amendments, the Home Builders only asked for about 20 or 30 amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7561)|
| 2:06:07| We negotiated with them, if you want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| We still retained the minimum standard by the state of Tennessee, which requires us to adopt the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7571)|
| 2:06:19| the same code or more stringent than they had, which we have done and completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7579)|
| 2:06:26| There was a question about residential sprinklers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| and the state of Tennessee passed a law that required this body to vote by a supermajority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| to adopt residential sprinklers into our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| That was one of the biggest items on the plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| But other than that, we've looked at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| I don't think there's anything major in this that would cause a substantial increase in dollars for home builders of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7606)|
| 2:06:56| Was that sprinklers for single-family residents or for multi-family apartments and such?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7616)|
| 2:07:02| Single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| It was required for single-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| And to build a new house, you're going to have to put in a sprinkler system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| Not unless this body votes by two-thirds majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7630)|
| 2:07:15| Thank you, Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| Just kind of along that, and I know the home builders do a great job of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7640)|
| 2:07:25| being there for those new home construction projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7645)|
| 2:07:31| But are there any potential unintended consequences for existing homeowners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7651)|
| 2:07:37| You know, those folks out there, house built in the 50s, and they want to do something to their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7657)|
| 2:07:43| And now, has their cost gone up significantly by adopting these new ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7663)|
| 2:07:52| Have we had anybody look at that in detail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| Yes, the home builders have in great detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7674)|
| 2:07:58| And, basically, the biggest item other than the sprinklers was energy conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7678)|
| 2:08:06| And we amended the code to go to the 2009 in the, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7686)|
| 2:08:11| 10 areas where it was going to cost a significant amount more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7691)|
| 2:08:16| Also, with existing buildings, the code does give some exception to existing buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7696)|
| 2:08:23| where they wouldn't have to meet the full extent of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7703)|
| 2:08:27| You know, because the reason I bring that up, and I'm in favor of making things safer and better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7707)|
| 2:08:33| but there will be some constituents that are going to go to COES,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| and they're going to tell me I have to do this, that, and that and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7717)|
| 2:08:40| So I just want to make sure that there's no glaring costs out there that's going to drive their costs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7720)|
| 2:08:46| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7726)|
| 2:08:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7727)|
| 2:08:48| One more here, Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7728)|
| 2:08:49| Mr. Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| Roy, we get a lot of phone calls as commissioners on dirty lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| What are the changes on dirty lots, if any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| The one of the dirty lot issues that was put in this package is that appeals would be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7737)|
| 2:09:08| I think it's a good move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7748)|
| 2:09:10| Daniel Sanders and I has worked hard on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7750)|
| 2:09:13| And I think that we're going to streamline things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7753)|
| 2:09:16| We're going to make things better in the sense that the inspectors will be able to do a better job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7756)|
| 2:09:20| be more consistent with what we do, and actually work with constituents to make things better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7760)|
| 2:09:27| It gives us really no more authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| It's just we're dressing it up and putting it in one package to where we can do a better job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| and hopefully not make mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| I'm building on Commissioner McKenzie's question about unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| We've ran into fire hydrant locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7787)|
| 2:09:54| And somewhere in here I've read 400 foot of hose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| What does that relate to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| If I want to go build a house, do I have to be within 400 foot of a hydrant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| I will defer to our fire person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7804)|
| 2:10:08| Well, it may not be that we need a definitive answer on that, but you see the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7808)|
| 2:10:13| Does that take a lot of the what is considered residential building sites, one acre sites on a farm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7813)|
| 2:10:22| Does that take them off the table as far as -?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7822)|
| 2:10:25| And that's just an example of looking at the unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7825)|
| 2:10:37| My name is Travis Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| My address is 1918 Greenwood Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7839)|
| 2:10:47| As far as the difference in what we have now and as far as the fire hydrant itself, there really hasn't been a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7847)|
| 2:10:53| It's the same as what's adopted now under the 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7853)|
| 2:10:57| Okay, but about three years ago we went through a change to some international code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7857)|
| 2:11:02| and we got hung up on a fire hydrant in the ninth district, the rebuild of a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7862)|
| 2:11:09| And since then we had been hung up on one on John Spear Highway for the building of a restroom at the soccer fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7869)|
| 2:11:22| And it had to do with how close was the fire hydrant to building a restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7882)|
| 2:11:29| And reading through the information that's in this attachment, there's reference to 400 foot of hose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7889)|
| 2:11:37| And that was something that changed when we adopted the 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7897)|
| 2:11:42| When we adopted the 06 code, if I'm remembering correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| we went from the 97 standard fire prevention code to the 2006 international fire code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7906)|
| 2:11:53| There was a big difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| But from the 06 to the 2012, as far as this issue itself, there's not a lot of difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7915)|
| 2:12:02| Okay, the reason being is there are lots of pages of attachment here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| and we may not know exactly the difference of where we're coming from and what we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7927)|
| 2:12:13| So I just use that as one example of we don't want to get in a place of unintended consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7933)|
| 2:12:20| I thank you for your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| Okay, any other questions for Roy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7944)|
| 2:12:27| Okay, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7947)|
| 2:12:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7950)|

| 2:12:32| Thanks, Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| Item 39 is Ordinance O-12-9-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7954)|
| 2:12:38| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| It's amending Article 1, Article 2, Article 3, Article 4, Article 5, and Article 6 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7960)|
| 2:12:47| Appendix A of the Knox County Code, to edit, clarify, correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| and make other minor changes to the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7971)|
| 2:12:54| which amends Ordinance O-9-0-9-130 adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7974)|
| 2:13:02| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7982)|
| 2:13:03| Can I make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7983)|
| 2:13:05| I'd like to make a motion to send it without recommendation because I haven't had time to read through all that yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| the corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7990)|
| 2:13:11| But that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7991)|
| 2:13:12| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| Okay, any discussion or questions for Mr. Dawson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| He's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7997)|
| 2:13:18| Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| It's sort of that standard question, what may be the changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=7999)|
| 2:13:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8004)|
| 2:13:31| Mark Donaldson with NBC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| This was actually initiated by Knox County Codes and Enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8013)|
| 2:13:39| Roy and his staff literally went through the entire zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8019)|
| 2:13:44| and edited it to put it in one voice, one type of format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8024)|
| 2:13:51| I think there were more than 700 individual changes ranging from putting hyphens in the right spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8031)|
| 2:13:59| to capitalization in the right spot to creating a consistent format throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8039)|
| 2:14:06| We have reviewed it and found no changes of substance or permitted uses or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8046)|
| 2:14:14| So we're very comfortable with the changes that were put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8054)|
| 2:14:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| So motion to move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8061)|

| 2:14:30| Item number 40, Ordinance O-12-9-103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8070)|
| 2:14:35| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| It's amending Article 5, Section 5.80 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| Appendix A of the Knox County Code entitled Historical Overlay Zone, HZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8081)|

| 2:15:03| Any other motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8105)|

| 2:15:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| Ms. Burwells, a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8109)|

| 2:15:12| Is Mark here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| There you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| Good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| To explain how this is different from what we're doing currently, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8117)|
| 2:15:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8122)|
| 2:15:23| This ordinance is an effort to amend our local code to conform with state law, and there are two primary changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8123)|
| 2:15:32| One is that state law provides the authority to appoint members to the Historic Zoning Commission to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8132)|
| 2:15:44| I've got that backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8144)|
| 2:15:46| To the commission rather than the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8146)|
| 2:15:48| And then it also speaks to having a member of the Planning Commission also sit on the member of the Historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8148)|
| 2:15:58| Zoning Commission, and we have amended the ordinance, and as a new vacancy occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8158)|
| 2:16:06| we will find a Planning Commissioner who will volunteer to step on to the county's Historic Zoning Commission as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8166)|
| 2:16:17| that link between the two bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8181)|
| 2:16:22| Currently, how many appointments does the county make and how many appointments does the city make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8182)|
| 2:16:28| Well, the Historic Zoning Commission actually is two separate bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8188)|
| 2:16:33| So there is a five-member county Historic Zoning Commission and a nine-member city Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8193)|
| 2:16:42| They sit as a single body to review applications, but they act separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8202)|
| 2:16:51| So the Knox County Historic Zoning Commission acts only on applications that occur in the county and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8211)|
| 2:16:59| But they collectively review all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8219)|
| 2:17:03| And it's a very good synergy that goes on between the two bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8223)|
| 2:17:09| It works pretty effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8229)|
| 2:17:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| And so you're saying that now there has to be someone who sits on NBC board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8233)|
| 2:17:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8238)|
| 2:17:19| We're doing the same thing in the city, and we literally have to find another one from the Planning Commission to sit on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8239)|
| 2:17:27| city Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| So we'll be looking for two volunteers from that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8249)|
| 2:17:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| Any other questions for Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8256)|
| 2:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8259)|
| 2:17:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8260)|
| 2:17:41| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| It was to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8265)|
| 2:17:46| To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| All in favor say aye again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8270)|
| 2:17:51| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| And now we're on page 7, item number 41, Ordinance O-12-9-104 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8274)|
| 2:18:02| It is amending Article 2 and Article 3 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance, Appendix A of the Knox County Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8282)|
| 2:18:08| regarding the regulation of signs, billboards, electronic message centers, and other advertising structures in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8288)|
| 2:18:15| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8295)|
| 2:18:23| I can hear a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| I'd like to make a motion that we oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| We have a gentleman here from Lamar that wants to speak that is just new to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8309)|
| 2:18:34| Mr. Hunley, do you want to say a few words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| Yeah, I'd just like to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| Let's have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8319)|
| 2:18:40| Let's have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8320)|
| 2:18:41| Let's have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8321)|
| 2:18:42| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8322)|
| 2:18:43| Let's have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8323)|
| 2:18:44| I'll make a motion to defer for how much time were you needing to look at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8324)|
| 2:18:47| He's new to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| By far, they have more signs than anybody, I presume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| And, I mean, you need 30, 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| How much time do you need to research?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| Thirty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8337)|
| 2:18:58| Okay, so we have a motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8340)|
| 2:19:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8342)|
| 2:19:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8343)|
| 2:19:04| I'd just like to introduce myself to the commission, you know, the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8344)|
| 2:19:09| My name is Brian Conley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8349)|
| 2:19:10| I'm the vice president for Lamar Advertising, 3009 West Industrial Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8350)|
| 2:19:15| And I would just like to thank you for the consideration of giving us time to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8355)|
| 2:19:22| We would just like to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| I'd really like to see it tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8364)|
| 2:19:25| I'd like to see a study group put together with industry, community leaders, so we could come to a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8365)|
| 2:19:32| as opposed to an all-out ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| I don't think really an all-out ban is going to accomplish anything that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8374)|
| 2:19:39| the community is looking for, the commissioners are looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| I've worked in many states with municipalities, counties, townships with very similar issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8381)|
| 2:19:48| And I just know that we can come to a compromise if we, you know, are given a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8388)|
| 2:19:53| You know, similar to just like the building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| You know, they went to the Home Builders Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| They worked with them to see what other areas are doing, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8399)|
| 2:20:04| And that's the only consideration I'd like to ask for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8412)|
| 2:20:13| You know, just to give a little historical background on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8413)|
| 2:20:16| It was back in 2008 that we put a moratorium on new billboards in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8416)|
| 2:20:22| There were several reasons behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| One, we wanted just to put a stop to it until we had a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| And secondly, the issue came up about converting some of the regular billboards into digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8427)|
| 2:20:33| And I think sometimes we need to define what digital billboards are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8433)|
| 2:20:38| These are the ones that looks like your home television screen that are changing all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8438)|
| 2:20:43| And then the third item that's referred to here are the electronic message centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8443)|
| 2:20:48| because some people have confused those with the digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| I believe we have six or seven digital billboards in the county right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8451)|
| 2:20:56| I've seen three or four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8456)|
| 2:20:58| I think there's one someplace up north that I haven't seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| I think that's really about the only one I haven't looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8461)|
| 2:21:06| Yeah, that's the one I haven't seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| It's the one that's up in the halls area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8468)|
| 2:21:11| But to any extent, when we --and I agree very much that we need to go ahead and give you an opportunity to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8471)|
| 2:21:18| And before we vote the final vote on this finally, we may need to have some public input on this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8478)|
| 2:21:28| I don't disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8488)|
| 2:21:30| One of the things that I had really proposed doing is rather than making a blanket ordinance like we have right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8490)|
| 2:21:38| that's all inclusive, I would really prefer to break this down into two or three different categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8498)|
| 2:21:44| And one of the categories would be billboards in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8504)|
| 2:21:48| And these are the standard billboards that we've known for many decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8508)|
| 2:21:52| The second would deal with the digital billboards, whether we want to have conversion of the standard billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8512)|
| 2:21:59| to the digital billboards and let that be a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8519)|
| 2:22:02| And then have a third issue of looking at the electronic message centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8522)|
| 2:22:06| which are sort of a different topic altogether and really see what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8526)|
| 2:22:13| Because there's going to be a lot of arguments about why we should go ahead and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8533)|
| 2:22:18| One, we've had the moratorium now for four years and probably a little over four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8538)|
| 2:22:24| I believe it was in the spring, but I may be wrong, of 2008 that we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8544)|
| 2:22:28| We've had no new billboards since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8548)|
| 2:22:30| Secondly, the city of Knoxville banned new billboards ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8550)|
| 2:22:35| And we'll hear some about how that has an economic impact on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8555)|
| 2:22:40| I think if we looked at the city of Knoxville and the development that has occurred in the last ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8560)|
| 2:22:45| it's probably we've had more development in the last ten years in downtown Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| than we did probably the previous 30, because before that it was all, you know, all very negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8570)|
| 2:22:57| And then there's also a safety issue with the billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8577)|
| 2:23:02| And I'll concede that that's very controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| There was one study that looked like it was going to try to answer the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8585)|
| 2:23:09| but I think probably it turned out that it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| So that may or may not be relevant to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8592)|
| 2:23:17| And then the third deals with the impact just on neighborhoods and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| I know we receive a lot of complaints about people who want to go out and sit on their patios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| And maybe there's a billboard someplace around that's not too obtrusive and too bothersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8606)|
| 2:23:33| But when you flip those to the digital billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8613)|
| 2:23:37| we've even had people say unless we've had one lady say that unless I close the curtains to my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8617)|
| 2:23:42| it's like a kaleidoscope in there all night long in the bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| So I think these are the things that we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| And we may very well need to have public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8629)|
| 2:23:52| But I support what Commissioner Smith brought up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8636)|
| 2:23:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| I'd like to re-echo what Commissioner Briggs just stated on the public hearing part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8640)|
| 2:24:05| Before we discuss it among ourselves, I would like to see us have at least one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8645)|
| 2:24:12| and maybe a couple of different public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8652)|
| 2:24:16| And I believe that was the direction we were headed with the former chair of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8656)|
| 2:24:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| Ms. Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8663)|
| 2:24:24| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we go ahead and break this into three separate ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8664)|
| 2:24:31| and that we go ahead and set dates for public hearings on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8671)|
| 2:24:37| I think two, one during the day and one in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8677)|
| 2:24:42| And to be able to set those up and give us sufficient time probably is going to take more than 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8682)|
| 2:24:50| So to defer it for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8690)|
| 2:24:54| So that would be a substitute motion to break it into three separate ordinances as outlined by Dr. Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8694)|
| 2:25:01| to defer it for 60 days and during those 60 days have two public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8701)|
| 2:25:06| one during the day and one in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8706)|
| 2:25:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8712)|
| 2:25:13| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8713)|
| 2:25:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8714)|
| 2:25:15| More discussion on the sub-motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| Anybody understand the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8718)|
| 2:25:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| Voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8726)|
| 2:25:27| Can I make a request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8727)|
| 2:25:28| I mean, I agree with Amy and all that, but I would rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8728)|
| 2:25:33| Don't look east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8733)|
| 2:25:34| Jesus is not coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| I would rather go ahead and postpone it, Amy, and then look at the ordinances separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8738)|
| 2:25:46| without just having a voice separation right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| Because I do, too, like the separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| But I'd like to do it with paper in front of us before we, because we're going to be 30, 60 days out anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8751)|
| 2:25:57| Let's separate them next month, before next month, and have a read on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8760)|
| 2:26:01| So you mean just go ahead and postpone 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| And then separate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| And then separate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8765)|
| 2:26:06| And then go ahead and show me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8766)|
| 2:26:07| Get the same thing done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8767)|
| 2:26:08| I'd like to see it in paper before we pull it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8770)|
| 2:26:11| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8774)|
| 2:26:15| We've revised it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8775)|
| 2:26:16| That's acceptable and acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8778)|
| 2:26:19| We've got...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8779)|
| 2:26:20| Can NPC write those out, three separate ordinances for us, and get those to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8780)|
| 2:26:26| Let's let the law director maybe do that instead, if that's okay with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8786)|
| 2:26:32| It's been a long time since we considered this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8792)|
| 2:26:35| And I'm not sure that we made a recommendation on digital billboards, per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8795)|
| 2:26:39| But I'll take a look at it and be able to report back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| But we definitely can separate billboards from EMCs, because they are two different critters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| So you can bring us back a recommendation next month, maybe work with the law department on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8807)|
| 2:26:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8812)|
| 2:26:53| I can review what we've prepared and separate them to the extent that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8813)|
| 2:27:00| Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8820)|
| 2:27:01| You know, one of the things, and I'll, you know, make this suggestion to the law office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8821)|
| 2:27:06| The city of Knoxville has already done a lot of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8826)|
| 2:27:10| And I attended a lot of their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| And I think you can draw on your colleagues in the law department at the city to see how this is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8832)|
| 2:27:19| But I think we do want to include, or I want to include, the digital billboards as another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8839)|
| 2:27:25| Because to me, there's a difference between no new billboards, which we may or may not agree on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8845)|
| 2:27:32| and then even if we do that, it's having the conversion of present existing billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8852)|
| 2:27:38| Because that issue is going to come up, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8858)|
| 2:27:40| And I think we need to address all three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8860)|
| 2:27:43| Or at least we need to address the billboards, those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| Then the EMCs are a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8865)|
| 2:27:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8868)|
| 2:27:49| So, Mr. Connelly, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8871)|
| 2:27:52| I would just like to say, you know, I wholeheartedly agree with you on the three separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8872)|
| 2:27:56| I've done that in several jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| Again, though, I would just like to be able to work with the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8878)|
| 2:28:03| to show them what other, you know, municipalities, counties, townships have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8883)|
| 2:28:08| and give you some different ideas of what I know what the goal is that you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8888)|
| 2:28:15| And doing the three separate ones is what, you know, several of them I've worked with have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8895)|
| 2:28:20| But I would just still like the ability to show you, you know, the Metropolitan Planning Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8900)|
| 2:28:25| whoever's going to come up with the ordinance, you know, how other ordinances have been written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8905)|
| 2:28:32| Mr. Armstrong, would you like to exchange business cards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8912)|
| 2:28:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8915)|
| 2:28:36| Our law director, Mr. Armstrong, would like to speak to it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8916)|
| 2:28:40| We have been looking at this situation, and I think we have quite a bit of background on it already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8920)|
| 2:28:47| Some of the terms I believe that Daniel Sanders has been working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8927)|
| 2:28:55| and we would like to get with MPC and look at three different proposals for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8935)|
| 2:29:01| for the electronic message center and other types of conversions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8941)|
| 2:29:05| and some advanced technologies I think they've been talking about that could be out in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8945)|
| 2:29:10| and just try to give you something that will deal with this whole package at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8950)|
| 2:29:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8955)|
| 2:29:16| Mr. Smith and Joyce, I'll get to you in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8956)|
| 2:29:20| Mark, how many, just review this real quick, how many billboards do we have this pertains?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8960)|
| 2:29:28| Is it still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8970)|
| 2:29:31| I have had some data for billboards within the city, and it was on the order of 500, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8971)|
| 2:29:38| There certainly aren't that many outside of the city, but it's probably not far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8978)|
| 2:29:44| And, Mr. Huntley, what percentage of that do you own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| Does your company own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8986)|
| 2:29:47| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8987)|
| 2:29:48| We have 78 billboards in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8991)|
| 2:29:52| I thought you all probably had more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8992)|
| 2:29:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8993)|
| 2:29:54| I can forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8994)|
| 2:29:55| I'll send it to Julie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8995)|
| 2:29:56| I think I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8996)|
| 2:29:57| I think I can still find this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| We have the total number of permits that have been issued since about 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=8999)|
| 2:30:04| Welcome to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9006)|
| 2:30:07| Oh, just real quick, and this is probably to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9007)|
| 2:30:10| It looks like Item 46 says that we have a moratorium expire, that expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9010)|
| 2:30:16| So should we tack on something on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9016)|
| 2:30:19| Or how do you want to handle probably extending the moratorium at least till we get to the end of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9019)|
| 2:30:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| We probably can for a real short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9028)|
| 2:30:30| I think we've about run this rope out in terms of legal defensibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9030)|
| 2:30:34| and we're getting really out on the edge because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9034)|
| 2:30:38| it's not fair to the billboard industries and everyone else just to keep going on and on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9038)|
| 2:30:44| without some form of due process, some form of analysis, some form of something definitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9044)|
| 2:30:50| So if you want to try to defer this, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| Can I just add it to my?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9053)|
| 2:30:54| Sixty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9054)|
| 2:30:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9055)|
| 2:30:56| Sixty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9056)|
| 2:30:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| I think we have a resolution that we will extend that for 60 more days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9058)|
| 2:31:04| Sixty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| And that seems to be acceptable to Mr. Connelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9065)|
| 2:31:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9068)|
| 2:31:09| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9069)|
| 2:31:12| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9072)|
| 2:31:13| Joyce, come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9073)|
| 2:31:14| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9076)|
| 2:31:17| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9077)|
| 2:31:23| I'm president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9083)|
| 2:31:25| I'm concerned about this relationship between the industry and MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9085)|
| 2:31:32| I trust Mr. Donaldson completely, but I'm not sure why the industry is getting together with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9092)|
| 2:31:38| Donaldson for input on the wording of these resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9098)|
| 2:31:42| It seems to me that that gives the industry undue influence and input on this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9102)|
| 2:31:48| and I'm confused by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9108)|
| 2:31:50| Is there a precedent for that, for the industry getting together with MPC and advising them how to write the resolutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9110)|
| 2:32:00| It doesn't seem balanced to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9120)|
| 2:32:02| As he said a while ago, he's been through this several times with other towns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9122)|
| 2:32:07| and he's got the information already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| Why rewrite the book if it's already written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9129)|
| 2:32:11| If the MPC takes a look at it and it works for us, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| If it doesn't work for us, then we won't have to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| But at least he's done some of the groundwork on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| The city of Knoxville has very clear, explicit language already in their ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| which covers all three of their resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9144)|
| 2:32:26| And so it seems to me that one could start by looking at the language in the Knoxville ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9146)|
| 2:32:33| I think that the language that the industry is going to advocate is going to be very different from the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9153)|
| 2:32:39| that most people in the community and certainly that Scenic Knoxville is going to want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9159)|
| 2:32:45| Ms. Felden, we certainly appreciate your role as watchdog in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9165)|
| 2:32:49| I would like Mr. Armstrong to mention or give his take on this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9169)|
| 2:32:56| What our plan is, at least subject to commission approval, is the law department will actually write these resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9176)|
| 2:33:04| We will be working with the MPC to make sure that we're in alignment with their planning policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9184)|
| 2:33:09| and it's something that we come up with that is palatable for them to monitor and implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9189)|
| 2:33:17| I have no problem with industry giving input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| but in the end it's going to be between the professionals in the planning community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9200)|
| 2:33:26| and my staff will actually come up with the actual wording of what these ordinances are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9206)|
| 2:33:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9214)|
| 2:33:35| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9215)|
| 2:33:36| I have a little bit of an objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9216)|
| 2:33:39| It really shouldn't be between the MPC and the law department to decide what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9219)|
| 2:33:42| It should be the county commission and the law department or the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9222)|
| 2:33:46| And I agree with you, Mike, about, you know, the book's already been written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9226)|
| 2:33:50| Let's use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9230)|
| 2:33:51| You're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9231)|
| 2:33:52| It's been written by the city of Knoxville, and it's been working, and it's been working for ten years, and it's been defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9232)|
| 2:33:58| And that has been looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9238)|
| 2:34:01| It has been tested, and it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9241)|
| 2:34:04| And, you know, as the famous saying goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9244)|
| 2:34:07| And if the book's already been written, let's use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| And we've got both of that right here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9249)|
| 2:34:12| We don't need people from New York or California or someplace else telling us how to do things here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9252)|
| 2:34:19| We've got a way that works right here in the city of Knoxville, which is part of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9259)|
| 2:34:24| It's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9264)|
| 2:34:26| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9266)|
| 2:34:27| It hasn't hurt business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| And that's what I think we ought to be using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9269)|
| 2:34:31| And it shouldn't, you know, it shouldn't be industry, you know, conniving with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9271)|
| 2:34:36| with the MPC and the law department, and this should be coming from the county commission on what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9276)|
| 2:34:42| If I can comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| Well, what I was going to say is that I think we all got the letter from Greg Isaacs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9284)|
| 2:34:50| And obviously, and that's what we're hearing, too, is pushing really hard for some kind of joint task force to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9290)|
| 2:34:56| and ride all this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| And I understand where you were going with that, and I don't agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9298)|
| 2:35:03| I don't have a problem with you all trading business cards and you giving him your information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9303)|
| 2:35:08| but I'm certainly not in favor of the industry being part of the process of writing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9308)|
| 2:35:14| That's not at all what I was suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9314)|
| 2:35:16| And I also think that scenic Knoxville, there's nothing to stop scenic Knoxville from also turning all of their information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9316)|
| 2:35:23| over to MPC also so that they have the benefit of what both sides are thinking on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9323)|
| 2:35:28| But I'm not in favor at all of a joint task force putting everybody together to try to hammer out something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9328)|
| 2:35:35| that looks better to the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| That's not at all where I was going with that, and that's why I did not recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9338)|
| 2:35:43| So I'm comfortable with, you know, everybody give their input to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9343)|
| 2:35:47| but ultimately it's the law department and MPC based on what's already happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9347)|
| 2:35:51| and working right here locally in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9351)|
| 2:35:54| And then it comes to us, and it's up to us to be the final determiner on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9354)|
| 2:35:58| So I hope that all of that is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9358)|
| 2:36:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9363)|
| 2:36:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9364)|
| 2:36:05| I agree with that completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| I mean, I'm very familiar with the industry's playbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| and I can probably write exactly what they're going to advise MPC to write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9369)|
| 2:36:14| You know, they're going to be asking for a tradeoff between traditional billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9374)|
| 2:36:18| We'll take down three traditionals if you let us put up one digital, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9378)|
| 2:36:22| And it's all going to be to their advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9382)|
| 2:36:25| It's not going to be to the community's advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| And I guarantee you it's not what the people of this community are going to want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9387)|
| 2:36:32| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9392)|
| 2:36:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9393)|
| 2:36:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9394)|

| 2:36:41| And an extension of the moratorium for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9401)|

| 2:38:27| Okay, we had a couple of people who wanted to speak to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9507)|
| 2:38:31| Gary Alpea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9511)|
| 2:38:36| Would you like to speak, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9516)|
| 2:38:41| And just give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9521)|
| 2:38:45| And the second person is William Shaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9525)|
| 2:38:49| So go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9529)|
| 2:38:50| You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| Gary Alpert, 2320 East Fifth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9532)|
| 2:38:58| I'm new to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9538)|
| 2:38:59| I've been here a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9539)|
| 2:39:01| I'm the president of a young manufacturing company that's come to build factories throughout East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9541)|
| 2:39:08| I have a groundbreaking request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9548)|
| 2:39:13| It's the first time I've brought it up publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9553)|
| 2:39:18| I have talked with some people in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9558)|
| 2:39:20| I met David Milhorn at UT and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9560)|
| 2:39:27| There's a new type of manufacturing that will be coming to the country to the tune of 10 million jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9567)|
| 2:39:36| These aren't widget jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9576)|
| 2:39:39| These are high-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9579)|
| 2:39:41| They'll rebuild our middle class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| The jobs could pay between $30,000 and $150,000 a year working on the factory floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9585)|
| 2:39:53| Stanford University has a master's program, and that person could make $150,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9593)|
| 2:40:00| understanding robotics, software, and craftsmanship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9600)|
| 2:40:04| So with that said, I'm going to request that 10 percent of the $3 million that remains be an initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9604)|
| 2:40:14| funding of schooling for this new wave of manufacturing that will be coming to the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9614)|
| 2:40:23| A book was written on it in 1992 by a scholar at MIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9623)|
| 2:40:28| He was a senior person at IBM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| It is an automated type of manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9630)|
| 2:40:33| And I just want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9633)|
| 2:40:36| It will link high schools, community colleges, and universities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9636)|
| 2:40:42| The $300,000 could go to a community college effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9642)|
| 2:40:46| And I just want to end and say over the next seven years, this will bring 100,000 manufacturing jobs to Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9646)|
| 2:40:59| paying between $30,000 and $150,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9659)|
| 2:41:05| This is a new agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9665)|
| 2:41:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9668)|

| 2:41:13| I live here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9673)|
| 2:41:14| I've come from Baltimore, Maryland, as the president of G. David Works Manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9674)|
| 2:41:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9678)|
| 2:41:19| Mr. Albert, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9679)|
| 2:41:21| And, you know, this is an item that we don't act on, but Dr. McIntyre is in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9681)|
| 2:41:28| I don't know whether you've met him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| You might speak to him about that and some connectivity there for you and him going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9690)|
| 2:41:38| And if we can be, of course, we are extremely interested in jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9698)|
| 2:41:44| We've read the book and the coming jobs war, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9704)|
| 2:41:48| And so we're very interested in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| So, yes, we'll investigate and pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| I just want to qualify and say this is a subject, this automated type of manufacturing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9715)|
| 2:42:03| that is only in a few individuals around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9723)|
| 2:42:07| And I just want to qualify myself that I am interested in helping Knox County grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9727)|
| 2:42:13| and also the University of Tennessee of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9733)|

| 2:42:33| I spoke to you last spring about this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9753)|
| 2:42:37| And I come here once again to urge that you support some allocation of any surplus funds to the senior transportation area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9757)|
| 2:42:50| The greatest problem facing seniors is isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9770)|
| 2:42:55| And we have a county in which automobiles dominate transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9775)|
| 2:43:02| And, therefore, for older citizens, many unable to drive anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9782)|
| 2:43:08| there must be a way for them to get to doctor's appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9788)|
| 2:43:12| to get to all the various things that people have to handle in their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9792)|
| 2:43:18| And we have had, this past spring, a needs assessment program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9798)|
| 2:43:30| I am chair of the Knoxville-Knox County Council on Aging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9810)|
| 2:43:37| which is an advisory group to the Office on Aging of CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9817)|
| 2:43:43| And we hold these assessment meetings periodically to provide input from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9823)|
| 2:43:53| both providers of senior services and users of those services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9833)|
| 2:43:59| to provide their ideas about what is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| In our discussion groups at that needs assessment program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9843)|
| 2:44:08| every panel mentioned transportation as a top issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9848)|
| 2:44:14| And that's despite a good deal of transportation activity that goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9854)|
| 2:44:21| And to announce these programs or waiting lists to help these folks is a very important element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9861)|
| 2:44:30| to keep them from being isolated and falling into the problems that that makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9870)|
| 2:44:36| I hope you will support the idea of additional funding for seniors' transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9876)|
| 2:44:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9883)|
| 2:44:45| Thank you, Mr. Schoenholdt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9885)|
| 2:44:50| Any other speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9892)|
| 2:44:53| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9893)|
| 2:44:54| Item number 48, discussion regarding a 2% pay increase for Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9894)|
| 2:44:59| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9899)|
| 2:45:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| I know this is a sticky subject for a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| but we've got some fine people working for the county that they did get a bump this past January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9909)|
| 2:45:17| But it had been like five years before that for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9917)|
| 2:45:20| When they look at their counterparts in the city, they get a 2.5% every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9920)|
| 2:45:26| Naturally, I would feel kind of disgruntled myself if I was in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| I think we're in a position right now that we can afford to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9930)|
| 2:45:34| I know that there are many of them that are working two, some of them three jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9934)|
| 2:45:39| to try to keep their head above water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9939)|
| 2:45:44| And I think it's important that all of these employees of the county who serve the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9944)|
| 2:45:52| need to feel better about themselves and their jobs so they can do a better job of serving those people in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9952)|
| 2:46:01| So that's my reason for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| I think that it's a little overdue and I'd like to see us do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9963)|
| 2:46:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9966)|
| 2:46:08| Mr. Caldwell, could you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9968)|
| 2:46:12| We had a discussion earlier about all things considered in terms of surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9972)|
| 2:46:19| and not tying the hands of the finance department, which we don't want to do, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9979)|
| 2:46:26| And so some of those discussions, I thought, were fruitful that you had with us the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9986)|
| 2:46:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9993)|
| 2:46:34| The point being is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9994)|
| 2:46:35| If you do, if Commissioner Brown put this in the form of a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=9995)|
| 2:46:40| that it was a 2% pay increase for employees, then basically that's a recurring expense over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10000)|
| 2:46:51| which you don't need to spend one time money on recurring expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10011)|
| 2:46:58| I think what I had said was something along the lines of if you were going to try to designate some of this money for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10018)|
| 2:47:08| I will call them employee expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10028)|
| 2:47:11| I would put it in the form of that because what happens is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10031)|
| 2:47:15| If we get to February of this year and we start the budget and sales taxes is continuing to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10035)|
| 2:47:22| and we see that our revenues are down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| but then we know that we have said we're going to do a 2% pay increase, then our hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10044)|
| 2:47:33| But if you do it in the form of saying employee benefit, like employee incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10053)|
| 2:47:40| and that could go for either like instead of if it's things are going good, you could do a percentage pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10060)|
| 2:47:47| If things are going bad, you could do a one-time bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10067)|
| 2:47:51| If things are terribly bad, then we could just put it toward our increase in our retirement plan that we know is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10071)|
| 2:48:02| We know that next fiscal year that the county's match is going to go from 17% to 19%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10082)|
| 2:48:09| And now, once again, that's recurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10089)|
| 2:48:12| But that would be like a worst-case scenario that could help you bridge the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10092)|
| 2:48:15| So there's ways around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| Now, this is not in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10097)|
| 2:48:19| It's just a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| But if you go down that road, I would ask you not to tie our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10101)|
| 2:48:27| Just give some flexibility there because if you do it in the form of a bonus, then that's a one-time expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10107)|
| 2:48:36| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10116)|
| 2:48:37| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10117)|
| 2:48:38| I think maybe Ms. Broils wants to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10118)|
| 2:48:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10123)|
| 2:48:44| I was just wondering if you could give us an update on where we are with the salary survey that the commission approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10124)|
| 2:48:49| and allocated funds for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10129)|
| 2:48:53| We are in the process of looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10133)|
| 2:48:57| Once again, the employee who was in the automobile accident, that was her specialty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10137)|
| 2:49:02| And so we need to try to get with her and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10142)|
| 2:49:05| But we're trying to wait for her to recover before we do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10145)|
| 2:49:09| But that is on the radar for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10149)|
| 2:49:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| Because it would be really great if we could have that completed and information back to us by the end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10154)|
| 2:49:19| because that's when we start talking about the next year's budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10159)|
| 2:49:24| And I don't want to get that information, you know, in March when the new budget is going to be presented, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10164)|
| 2:49:31| in six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10171)|
| 2:49:32| So the sooner we can get that, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10172)|
| 2:49:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10175)|
| 2:49:36| I'll relay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10176)|
| 2:49:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10177)|
| 2:49:38| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10178)|
| 2:49:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10179)|
| 2:49:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10180)|
| 2:49:41| How much would a two percent increase be in terms of total dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10181)|
| 2:49:46| $1.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10186)|
| 2:49:48| $1.82 million, I think, was the exact figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10188)|
| 2:49:51| $1.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10191)|
| 2:49:52| That is salary and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10192)|
| 2:49:54| And when you were talking about going from 17 to 19 percent, do we have any idea of what that number might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10194)|
| 2:50:02| As far as the UOP match goes, not right off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10202)|
| 2:50:07| I just know by talking to our actuary, Bob Cross, that in FY14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10207)|
| 2:50:14| that our match does take that two percent increase to make ourselves actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10214)|
| 2:50:21| Bob, for sure, what amount that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| When we look at our sales tax, October, November, December are key as we get into the holiday buying season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10223)|
| 2:50:32| So we're going to know probably within the next 90 to 120 days what our sales tax is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10232)|
| 2:50:38| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10238)|
| 2:50:39| There's no reason for us to panic and jump off the top of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10239)|
| 2:50:42| But I do think that as we look forward to October, November, December, if that trend continues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10242)|
| 2:50:48| these are just things we need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| We need to keep our, you know, finger on the pulse of what's going on with the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10250)|
| 2:50:54| My idea was to do this January anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10254)|
| 2:50:57| So that gives us time to take a look at some of these things you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10257)|
| 2:51:02| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10262)|
| 2:51:04| You know, I'm with Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10264)|
| 2:51:06| I mean, I'd like to give him a seven percent raise if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10266)|
| 2:51:08| But here's my thoughts and what's our biggest pressing needs that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10268)|
| 2:51:15| We've got the unfunded sheriff's pension plan that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10275)|
| 2:51:18| We've got debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10278)|
| 2:51:19| We've got a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10279)|
| 2:51:20| A lot of people want to do different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10280)|
| 2:51:22| So, you know, it may be just a discussion for you and I to have individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10282)|
| 2:51:26| But, you know, I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10286)|
| 2:51:28| I mean, I've got my own ideas what I think are pressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10288)|
| 2:51:31| But, you know, all of us have ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| I mean, for the employees, for the sheriff's department, school systems everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10293)|
| 2:51:38| not counting our own districts where we can come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10298)|
| 2:51:41| But we just need to see what we're really, if we got extra money, where do we put it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10301)|
| 2:51:46| Sir, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10306)|
| 2:51:47| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10307)|
| 2:51:48| And talking to one commissioner this morning, I talked to Mike Hammond this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10308)|
| 2:51:53| And he called because he got his e-mail about the sales tax decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10313)|
| 2:51:59| And he was having this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10319)|
| 2:52:01| And we both agreed that if there was one word that could, I guess, describe what we should do right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10321)|
| 2:52:09| that would say would be cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10329)|
| 2:52:11| Be cautious because, I mean, next month it could go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10331)|
| 2:52:15| Next month it could go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10335)|
| 2:52:17| I mean, you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10337)|
| 2:52:18| And so take a wait and see approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10338)|
| 2:52:21| And, I mean, that would be my thought process when we talk about these designations here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10341)|
| 2:52:28| I mean, what is necessary and what isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10348)|
| 2:52:32| I mean, we can have those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10352)|
| 2:52:34| But be cautious because we don't want to spend all of the surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10354)|
| 2:52:38| And then, lo and behold, at the end of FY13, we have a deficit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10358)|
