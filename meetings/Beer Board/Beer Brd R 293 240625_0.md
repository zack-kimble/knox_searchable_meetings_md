| 0:02:34| All right. Before we get started, I have a few announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| First, I'd like to point out, because I've learned a couple of new things recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| I want to make sure all of our Beer Board applicants and our Beer Board members know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| that we do have representatives from the Metro Drug Coalition that are here in the front of the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=168)|
| 0:02:55| for any of our applicants that might need them as a resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| When you get your beer permit, you do get a packet of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| Bethany Lemons is usually here to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| She's the prevention coordinator at Metro Drug Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| And then Webster Bailey has also joined us there to come to Beer Board today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| So look forward to working with them as we go through all the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| And if you guys need anything out there in the real world in your establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| please use them as a resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| They're doing a lot of great work in our community with prevention and addiction issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| And they would be better to explain that than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| So just want to put a face with the packet that you get when you get your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| When I call the name of the businesses applying for the permit, please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| State your name and address clearly into the microphone for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| Applicants who are approved pending final documentation will need to bring their completed stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=232)|
| 0:04:00| to the business tax office during regular business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| Applicants that have their permit approved tonight can pick up their permit at the end of this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| from Mr. Bird over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=247)|

| 0:18:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1099)|

| 0:18:25| We're going to move on to 7A, Dash and Go, Tamalynn Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| Ms. Harper is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| Ms. Harper, you are on the beer board agenda as an addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| We've made a motion to – sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| Let me get to the right part of my agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| We wanted to ask you how your progress is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| You and I met earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| I came out because you've been working on getting your beer permits since July 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| So I don't want to speak for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| I'll let you speak for yourself, but you have a meeting coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| So, yes, I have a meeting scheduled for Thursday to kind of, I guess, continue to get this in motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1146)|
| 0:19:14| I have, like I say, submitted the plans again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| They were accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| My problem is I can never get anyone to return an email or a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| This has been going on since I started this application with trying to figure out where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| and what's the next move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| So the last plans were accepted, and it went dead from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| So the meeting is to see where we are, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| and what else is needed for me to continue to get the building, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| where it needs to be and the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| But like I say, through this whole process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| it falls dead with communication from the people in the permits office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| I cannot get anyone to call me back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| I cannot get them to email me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| This has been going on since I submitted the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| and the only time that I've gotten any progress is when I actually talked to you earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| Does anybody have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| I went out and I met with Ms. Harper, and I took her the comments from her turned-in plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| and she has a meeting that is set up with Brian Berry on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1217)|
| 0:20:25| So I'm hoping that we can get you on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| And I apologize that you've had these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| but it sounds like after meeting with Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| hopefully it's moving in the right direction now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| and you'll be able to get the answers that you need to see what else is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| So given what she's been through, I'd like to extend for 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| and then let's come back and see what the status is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| and hopefully you've gotten some answers and had some progress and may be ready by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| So I'd like to move to extend for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Mr. Johnson says you're making a motion to extend to the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| That's what you proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| That's what I'm suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Yes, sir, whatever that 90 days is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1273)|

| 0:21:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1278)|

| 0:21:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Next on the agenda is Fast Hand Tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| Kevin Hibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Kevin Hibbs, 3800 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| So, Mr. Hibbs, we first approved you September 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| What's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| I apologize for the delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| I was basically waiting on – I finally finished up a sale of a previous business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| and that finally went through about two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| So, now I have the proper funding to finish up the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| So, in the next – you know, if I can get three months, I should be able to make a lot of progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1324)|

| 0:22:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| It looks to me like you have – when was the last time you did your background check and CAS class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1328)|
| 0:22:17| It was over a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| Mr. Byrd told me they'll probably have to redo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1343)|

| 0:23:58| TDOT wants me to fix the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| So they've been going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| And finally last week they approved, they came to an agreement on a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| So now my next step is to get a contractor to help me remodel the driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| so that I can get my right of way permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| That is one of the clause required on the application for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| Right, for a change of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1463)|

| 0:24:29| Do you know what was there in the building prior?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| It was a title company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1472)|

| 0:24:50| That will be about 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1490)|

| 0:26:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1585)|

| 0:27:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| And so we approved you guys June 27th, 2023 originally, and there have been a couple of extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| What's the latest progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| So this has been a bit of an elusive project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| Last month there was also a beer permit application for off-premises consumption that was filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| and approved pending a couple of items that needed to be done, one of which is the certificate occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1648)|
| 0:27:38| which we have a project discussion meeting scheduled for on the 1st to obtain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1658)|
| 0:27:45| 1st of June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1665)|

| 0:27:48| July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| So next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| And that was an application that was submitted as a supplement to this application because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| there has been an addition of a use component here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| There's going to be a retail component at this location as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| And through my discussions with Mr. Bird, we realized that we needed to submit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| application that was approved last month as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| So now we have two applications that are kind of not on the same track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| So we would request an extension until the August meeting to have this application and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1699)|
| 0:28:27| the off-premises application on the same track so that as we work through getting the certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| of occupancy and wrap up everything that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| It's the 4th district, so I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Well, Mike, I make a motion to extend for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1722)|
| 0:28:50| Until the August meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Until the August meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| Andrew, you should have stopped me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Ayes haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Fall as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| You don't have to come back and see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Real quick before everybody wraps up, we're going to have a couple of people that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| going to go back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| 6J, is there anyone here from Honeybee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| Mr. Hensley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Norris Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Nick Mazzilli?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Chair, I texted them, and I haven't gotten a response back from any of the numbers that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| were on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| I am thinking, though, that for folks that might not be used to coming downtown to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| meetings, since we've got road closures, it might have caused some problems for folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| that may not have figured out how to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| And there may be people here who have had that same problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1786)|
| 0:29:53| But I would suggest that maybe we put them to the next agenda just in case they had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1793)|
| 0:30:01| So I'll make a motion to postpone them to our next meeting, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| I have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Were you not opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| I just wanted to clarify if that was all of the no-shows or just Honeybee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| No, there's multiples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| Oh, you're asking is the motion for everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| Mine was just for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| I mean, we could make it for all of them, but that was the one I was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| I think it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| I've been informed we have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| We're going to do them one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| That was for 6J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| We have a motion to postpone to the next month, which is July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| It's summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| I can't get my head straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Everyone was in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| No one opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| That one passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| Then we're going to do 6K Honeybee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| Councilman Roberto, would you like to repeat your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| The second Honeybee is actually in the first district, but I'll make the same motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1853)|
| 0:31:01| You've been commandeered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| And then the next one I have here, Mr. Bird, if I skip something, you're going to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| me, but I have 6P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| That is One Stop Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Is anyone here from One Stop Market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| Juwani?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Would someone from the first district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| Turn your mic on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| Can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| I'll make a motion to postpone to the July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| I'll make a motion to postpone until July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| Next one, you guys just wanted to hear me say this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| 7D, Tienda y Carniceria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| So bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| It's pretty bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| No one is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Fifth district, would you like to comment on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Ms. Soto has been in contact with emails, and so we should give her the benefit of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| doubt for all the reasons that Councilman Roberto so eloquently stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| To July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| A multitude of seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| I believe we have no further business before the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| And?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| I just want to put something on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| It seems that we're seeing recurring patterns over the last few years where people are coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| in and we are extending some folks up to a year, and it sounds like also we're starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| to hear that there are some of these delays that are beyond their control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| I just wonder at some juncture if we could maybe pull those maybe permitting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| Peter Ahrens or someone to the table to have a conversation about how we can help those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| folks streamline a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| I just don't think it's fair if they're doing everything that they're supposed to do, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| now they have to spend more money on, you know, background checks and other things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| go along with when they have to renew again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| So I'd just like to put that out there for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| Anybody else want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| It's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| You know, I will say I had an extensive conversation about an hour-long visit with Ms. Harper today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2018)|
| 0:33:46| Very sharp lady, and what I came away from and what I told her is, like, I hear you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| and I hear you as someone who says, tell me what I need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| Do I need to do A, B, C, and D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| And what folks are hearing when they apply for a beer board permit is Mr. Bird says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| yep, you've got to get a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| A certificate of occupancy means a lot of things, and it could mean rebuilding an entire permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| It can mean stormwater systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2049)|

| 0:34:13| It can mean zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| It can mean a lot of things, and that's not what these folks understand when they walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| away with an approval from us pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| And Ms. Harper is very willing to do anything anyone tells her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| She just hasn't been told and doesn't understand what to do, and she's very willing to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| the fees that go along with that as long as she's prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| And, you know, like one of the gentlemen said here tonight, he had to save up the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| to be able to do and sell a business, and she seemed to be the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| She didn't balk at some of the things I brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| It's just not understanding the process and not having someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| So that is definitely something to have a conversation with the building department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| So, yeah, I don't know how we make progress on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| I feel like we've really been dealing with this since 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| It's just been a whole different animal since 2020 for permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| Mr. Bird, you've been doing this a lot longer than any of us, so I don't know what your opinion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| I think the process can be daunting for the average applicant who's not a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| I think in many ways the newer system that was implemented a few years ago is great for folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2122)|
| 0:35:30| that are building and renovating stuff, but that's not the average person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| I would be equally lost if I was in some of their shoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| So I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| I would be fully behind that, whatever we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| Any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2148)|

| 0:35:55| I don't know if people know that Webster Bailey is the new executive director there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| and I think he has an occasion he'd like to fundraise or he'd like to tell us about and give us some tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| Mr. Bailey, you don't have a microphone where you're at, I don't believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| so if you will come up to the podium and push the little person button and tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| Do you need my address too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| You can give us the address of MDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2179)|

| 0:36:30| Thanks for recognizing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2190)|

| 0:36:35| Many of you know what we do, but some may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| So we have a couple of arms of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| One arm is really prevention-focused for youth, and the other arm is more recovery-focused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| so trying to be a resource for people who are in the recovery process and help them maintain long-term recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2206)|
| 0:36:55| So we have a fundraiser event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2215)|

| 0:37:05| private schools, after-school programs, college campuses all over the place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| and these are under the threshold, the gift threshold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| so we have a ticket for each of you if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| I'll have them up front, so once you adjourn, if you'd like a ticket to our event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| it's at the pavilion at Hunter Valley Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2243)|

| 0:37:58| I did not realize that every beer board applicant got the packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| with prevention information and resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240625?start=2282)|
