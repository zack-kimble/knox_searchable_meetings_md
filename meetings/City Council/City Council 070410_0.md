| 0:02:59| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| We tried to schedule the workshop for last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| and Allison Evertine was unable to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| so therefore we had to postpone it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| We're trying for the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| We're not sure she can be present that day either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| so that may push it into May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Sorry, Mr. Grassley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| Is there any other business that needs to come before the Bear Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| Do we have a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| Chairman Holland, before you do that, I just wanted to report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| I did have my meeting with Ms. Maxwell that I had requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| It was a very nice meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=211)|

| 0:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=220)|

| 0:03:45| And since Mr. Frost is so eager, he will lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| If you'll all bow your heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| Our Heavenly Father, we come before you after another beautiful week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=234)|

| 0:04:06| Another wonderful spring in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=246)|

| 0:04:35| We pray that you'll be with those who are defending our freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| in some very far off lands, in some very dangerous conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| Pray your blessings upon them and upon their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=285)|

| 0:05:57| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| Well, let's take a second to find this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| G and H for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| And with a quick explanation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| these are the rezoning on Dutch Valley Road on the north side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=373)|
| 0:06:20| Currently the north sector plan is being developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| and it's coming up with some new guidelines for the north side of Dutch Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| My sense is in two weeks we're actually going to send this back to MPC for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| I wanted to postpone it so we can talk to everybody to make sure we're on line with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| So a two-week delay on those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=399)|

| 0:06:41| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=402)|

| 0:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| All those in favor of postponing 12G and H for two weeks, signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=410)|

| 0:06:53| Postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Councilman Hookless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| Two postponements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| 10A and, of course, that pairs up with 11P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| And then 10B and that one pairs up with 11Q.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| And these are actually going to have to be two separate motions, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| So we'll start with 10A and 11P postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| Are they both for two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| Is that why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| Are they different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| They're just totally different items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| So I thought it might be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| One motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| We'll do it in one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| You can explain why for both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| So both of them you want postponed for two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Second for Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| You want to explain real quick anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| Well, on 10A and 11P, the first item, under hearings of zoning matters, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=459)|
| 0:07:47| I think all of council has been hopeful that one of these days this thing will actually be heard by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| We had a meeting there on site again with both parties a few days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=474)|
| 0:08:02| It was Wednesday or so, I think Wednesday or Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| And I was promised by the people that wanted to develop the site that they'd have me something in hand by Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| And, again, I've received nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| So I think we'll just give them another shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| You know, I don't want this to go on indefinitely like I said last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| And on the others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| When are they here, Councilman Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Well, I don't know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| I looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| I don't see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| And then on 10B, that's the doctor's site, south waterfront, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| They're between Council Place and Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| And there are a lot of considerations and negotiations going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| And there's a lot of uncertainty at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| And we think that there's a pretty good chance of getting that resolved in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| And that may include withdrawal of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| But we don't know that yet for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| So we'll see what comes up in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| We fully support that two-week delay, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| No comment on the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| The second one fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Any other comments, questions on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=559)|

| 0:09:35| And consent items are 11U to 11Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Questions or comments on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=584)|

| 0:10:29| At 5 p.m., we're going to be unveiling something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| I think it's going to be a fun new addition to downtown Knoxville, some public art around Creech Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| If you've been through Creech Park, you've seen it all wrapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| We're going to have the unveiling tomorrow at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| It's a new initiative at Dogwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| Thursday at 7 o'clock brings back sundown in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| Everybody looks forward to those weeks of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| That will kick off this Thursday at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| Community Development Week is this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| So, on April 13th at 1.30, there will be an open house at Ironwood Studios, which is at 119 Jennings Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=653)|
| 0:11:01| Ironwood Studios at 119 Jennings Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| I think that will be a treat for those of you who can make it for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| The Dogwood Parade is this Saturday at 11 a.m. here in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| That's always a fun event for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| And the Home Federal ribbon cutting for the new facade on Market Square is April 18th at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| So, just a few quick calendar items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| Two more items of note in Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| Both of these are things that happened against my doubt, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| With even some council in one of the cases the other way, but I want to recognize two members of council for things that have happened since we last met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=693)|
| 0:11:41| Chris Woodhull became, as far as I know, the first sitting council person to ever run a complete marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| Ran the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| That's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| That's a note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| For the record, I said you're crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| Just run a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| It's a lot easier, but he did it just to prove me wrong, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| I also want to recognize Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| We had the Smart Growth Conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| I guess it's been 12 days ago now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Week go Friday, the 30th of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| Week go Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| And that was a, when he first started talking about it, I think a lot of us thought, man, that's a pretty monumental task you're trying to pull off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| In the end, we had a huge crowd there, brought in the Secretary of Transportation for the United States, the Commissioner of Transportation for the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| a lot of other noteworthy speakers, a lot of great seminars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| And, Joe, I think you were the main reason all that happened, and we very much appreciate all your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| Well, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| Thank you, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| And I want to thank the members of council that supported it through 202 funds, through the resolution, sponsoring it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=756)|
| 0:12:44| and those of you that were able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| I know you all weren't able to make it, and some weren't able to stay the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| But several of you were able to come, and for those that supported it, those were able to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| I want to thank you all because you all were supportive and all helped make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| We're going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| Mayor, I think we'd be remiss if we didn't mention that Councilman Roddy was the first to complete a full marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| She wasn't on council, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Well, we'll still give you credit for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| That still counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| I've handed out water at a marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| I could do more marathon jokes if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| Two announcements real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| One very important one on the continual discussions with the county about their stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| This Thursday at 530, the consultant that the city and the county jointly hired to study the proposed county ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=816)|
| 0:13:45| is going to be making a report in the small assembly room here next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| I think this is hopefully the beginning of a process of getting a stronger county ordinance to protect those of us in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| who live downstream from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Had a lot of problems with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| So that's Thursday at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| And then Saturday is the Lonsdale cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| I guess now it's become a yearly event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| Ten o'clock at I'm blanking on the name of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| Darn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| It's on the corner of Catherine Avenue and Johnston Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| It's a Lonsdale United Methodist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| That was hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| Lonsdale United Methodist, big cleanup in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| There will be probably a hundred or so people out moving in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=869)|

| 0:14:35| I know last year several of us from council were there as well as the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| and we always like to see those folks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=880)|

| 0:14:48| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| First, I was talking to Charlie Peruz today of Pizza Pals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| and he wanted me to make sure tonight to thank the city, administration, council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| and especially KPD for the good work they did with regards to the graffiti artists that they apprehended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=897)|
| 0:15:04| And apparently there were some of their properties that were vandalized in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| He wanted me to specifically say thank you, Chief, and thank you to the administration for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| And also a note of another check for the Super 6 District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| The Pizza Pals, which is in the Super 6 District, is going to be on the Food Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| On April 23rd, the Pizza Pals will be featured on the Food Network on diners, drive-ins, and dives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=926)|
| 0:15:36| It is a diner or a drive-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| We don't have any more dives in the Super 6 District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| But I wanted to make sure to let you all know, go to the Food Network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| and take a look at what time it's going to be on and support the Pizza Pals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| a great and other shining jewel in the crown of the Super 6 District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| It's appropriate we have the Bailey family here for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| I think all of them have had their share of onion rings and pizza and hamburger from the Pizza Pals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| Councilman Brown treated council tonight to some of their fine food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=960)|

| 0:17:37| Do we need to amend it or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1057)|

| 0:17:44| Do we need to add those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| I think that would be a good idea if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1066)|

| 0:19:27| with 11R, which is a resolution approving an appeal by William Steverson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1167)|
| 0:19:34| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1174)|

| 0:19:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| Ready to vote, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| The motion by Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| You know, I've heard a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| I, BZA, unanimously denied these variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| I'd like to hear a little more on why we think it's okay to overturn that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| There are a number of reasons it's not only okay, but it's important to overturn that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| And I think Mr. Seymour probably would prefer to speak to that, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| I'd be glad to, however.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1213)|
| 0:20:20| Subsequent to the BZA meeting, where some of the variances for this project were granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| and some denied, there has been a meeting between Mr. McBride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| Councilman Pelow, Terry Faulkner with the Bearden Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| and Greg Roach at West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| And Fire Marshal Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| Yeah, Fire Marshal Byrd and Jerry Maples, who is a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| And Mr. Byrd has suggested that there be a fire hydrant added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| and a realignment of a couple of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| And there should be a memo in your packet from him stating that with these changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1254)|
| 0:21:02| the development will be in compliance with fire code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| I might also state, and this is beyond your question, you can stop me right now if you want me to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1266)|
| 0:21:14| but a phrase that some think may be overworked but I think is still applicable, especially in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1274)|
| 0:21:22| A lot of people worked together to make this project come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| The people I've mentioned, Donna Young, Knoxville Greenways Coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| Terry Faulkner with the Bearden Council, Mr. McBride, the owner of the property and developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1292)|
| 0:21:41| Mr. Byrd with the Fire Marshal, Greg Roach at West High School, and have I left anybody out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1301)|
| 0:21:49| Councilman Pelow, and I think Councilman Hawquist and Councilman Becker were at the Bearden Council where this was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| Councilman Hawquist was present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| And there's been a lot of help from the city administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| This is a vacant piece of property that has been an issue on Sutherland Avenue for a long period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| and Mr. McBride has brought forward a plan that will solve a lot of issues not only for the city but for other people around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1328)|
| 0:22:17| And we would ask that you all support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| I've also talked to Mr. McBride and been out there seeing this property on numerous occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| and I think this is probably the best thing for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| There's some things going on behind the property that we don't want to expand it out to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| and I'm glad that he's worked with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| And, quite frankly, sometimes that's why we have appeals to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| because sometimes things happen that need to overturn actions from BZA or MPC, and it does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1361)|
| 0:22:48| And it's another shining example that we're not a rubber stamp board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| but one that allows the community and organizations to work together to get a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| And I think this is best for that piece of property, which happens to sit in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Ms. Peel, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Yes, I just wanted to comment on how much we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| I'm speaking now for the Bearden Council for several neighborhoods in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| who have had many issues with this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| and feel that having this development there, which will be lighted 24-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| it will also have surveillance cameras constantly in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| This is going to be so beneficial to the residential area immediately adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| where they have had a number of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| One of the variances is particularly important that we deal with because he has been willing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| Mr. McBride has been willing to build sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| and that will be very important to have a safe crossing there at West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| The high school is so very supportive of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| and both Salih Reynolds, who is the principal now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| and Mr. Roach, who will be assuming that position, are so very grateful for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| Terry has, of course, been, as usual, invaluable, and Donna as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| Because this is a part of the Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| the termination of this Greenway project that we celebrated yesterday with a wonderful ribbon-cutting, Mayor Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| and I think you are profoundly thanked for seeing to it that that project got completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| But this is just wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| It's a bookend for that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| and for where we have already invested so much of our city's taxpayers' dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1467)|
| 0:24:34| So it's a drive-down Sutherland if you haven't been there recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| and then give Mr. McBride a few months and drive down and see what he does to bookend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1486)|

| 0:24:52| Resolutions 11A is a resolution to honor the memory of former City Council Member Ed Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| and to offer condolences to the members of his family upon the occasion of his passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| I'd like to make a comment here, and if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| I know a lot of you all had the chance to drop by Ed's memorial service and to visit the family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1506)|
| 0:25:13| and you couldn't help but be there and notice four things that really, really mattered to Ed Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| Number one was his wife, Betty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| Number two were his boys, Jack, Jeff, Joe, and Jim, three of whom are here with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| Three are sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| When you see somebody who played 17 years in Major League Baseball, that's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| That doesn't happen often and loved golf and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| But fourth is the city of Knoxville and serving as you all have a city council folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| You know, that's really a labor of love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| You're doing it because you want to serve the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| You're not making big money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| You're not getting a lot more grief than you are dollars in reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| But you're doing it because you want to help the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| And as I watched all those slides flash by, it just really occurred to me how significant that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| and the service he had given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| And when I was waiting in line, it showed how many friends Ed had, how long the line was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| And I was waiting in line, and the person behind me said, you know, Ed Bailey was just a good man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| And I thought that was a great way to summarize him and his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| So it's an honor for me to be able to sign this resolution to recognize Ed and his family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| and all that you've done for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| Joe asked us, Joe's feelings are obviously very strong here and said he would love to say something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| but wasn't sure that he could pull all that off and just know how he feels about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| I'm going to, like I said, three of the four Bailey boys are here, Jack, Jeff, and Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1598)|
| 0:26:46| And Betty is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| And, Betty, I have a resolution like this for you, which I'll bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| But first, why don't we go ahead and vote if everyone is ready to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| Is everybody ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| I missed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1620)|
| 0:27:27| We thank all the Baileys for sharing Ed with the city and Joe with us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| We know there's a lot of nights you'd rather have had him home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| but we appreciate you sharing him with the city and all that he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1656)|

| 0:28:02| Questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Let me just ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| I guess one of the later items that made me think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| With regards to these types of projects, do we save money by allowing PBA to do those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| It's a small enough kind of project that I immediately began to think of a female-owned business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| or a disadvantaged business or someone of that nature who could probably do this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| and also we could assist them in what they're doing in employment and people out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| But do we tend to save money by having this done through a PBA-owned project, you know, that's a $28,000 project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1716)|
| 0:28:44| Bob, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Councilman Brown, let me try to address that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| It's not on the money issue and the contracting issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| Three years ago, for many years, we had a roofing consultant that helped us develop our roofing program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| and we have found PBA to be much less expensive than the roofing consultant that we used in years past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| in trying to develop our roofing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| And so while this is a smaller project, these projects all go anywhere from, you know, $15,000 up to a couple of hundred thousand dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| we use them to help us manage this program, and that's why we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| It's been a very efficient way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| They have term contractors in place, and they go out and give us three bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| and it happens very quickly and very expeditiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| And so that's why we go in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| Certainly we've made real efforts in the service department to contract with the minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| and women-owned businesses, and we'll continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1779)|

| 0:31:33| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Council Member Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Well, I just wanted to point out that this was one of the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| in the Fifth and Broadway plan, and that was a public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| where a lot of people came together, homeless providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| homeless agency providers, neighborhoods, business owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| to come together and build a shared interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| And one of the shared visions that we decided on was to address problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| but to really focus on strength and what's good and developable about that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| And so this is a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| My co-chair, Bill Lines, helped us through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| And do you have some additional comments about why this is significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| and this is important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Thank you, Council Member Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| Yes, it is significant not only because it came out of a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| which involved people in a very constructive way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| but it provides a great way to enable the redevelopment of some of the core areas in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| and really to connect downtown to some key areas slightly to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| We think this is mainly in place to allow some key catalyst projects to come into being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| And as you'll notice from the handouts that you have and the information that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| some of these, especially we're asking tonight for the 9-12 north central project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| are paying a pittance in property taxes right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| and are unoccupied and could provide a drain on city services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| and have tremendous potential not only to come into investment rather than out of disinvestment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| where they have been, but also to provide housing opportunities at a lower price point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| for people to live near downtown and to own homes near downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| Just since embarking upon this, we've had St. John's Lutheran Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| a tremendous amount on the corner that many of you see at Fifth and Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| and helping reclaim a block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| Others are already investing in facades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| The facade program is in cooperation with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| We have the MPC small area plan that's going to come along to help get some better uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| especially along the central corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| One of the facade projects that is in this area was one that the mayor mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| that he's going to visit on Jennings Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| So I think this really represents a tremendous opportunity for a real key area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| and for connectivity between downtown and the north in an area that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| and all members of this task force believe is poised for real development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| and great opportunities in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| I think that this is one of the good things to have come out of this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| When I saw this particular address show up on the BZA agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| I actually doubted that it was going to be this property because it has been such a drain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| for the city for years, having to keep it, you know, boarded up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| constant police calls, codes, and public service going out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| So this is a great old building, which is a testament that no matter the amount of abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| and neglect that can get thrown at a building, it still can be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| And as Dr. Lyons mentioned, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| a great way to build a city is to provide housing at different price points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| that meet different budgets, that meet different family needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| And this is a good way to do it because, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| some of the buildings in this area aren't simply underutilized, they're unutilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| which is the worst of the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| And a way to help, you know, greet people when they're traveling north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| or traveling south from North Knoxville into downtown Knoxville is going to be an area that is revitalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2119)|
| 0:35:26| that is welcoming, that does have shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| Peg Hambright and Scott Carpenter, folks might know Peg, is owning Magpies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| They've bought the old Colorama building, which I went out and saw six, seven weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| And Magpies is going to move there, and they're going to put a restaurant in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| And here's a building that's set vacant for at least a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| So we're on the cusp of what I'm hoping to be is something that's going to be really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| and, you know, support the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Excuse me, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| I actually have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| I think this is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| I think that some of the development that Councilman Forrest talked about is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| This is going to be a great area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| I think they talk about, you know, 2015, how this might look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| I always have some concerns about redevelopment areas and plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| and projects sort of for how much capacity do we have to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| And I don't think, as I sit in this chair longer, I start realizing that the limiting factor is more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| is not about money so much as it is people's attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| that one of the reasons that South Waterfront is going to be successful is we're putting money into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| I think a bigger piece is that we have, one, potentially more staff people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| who are waking up every day thinking about how do we make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| And I want to ask this question about who is the person who is going to be waking up every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| thinking about the Broadway Fifth redevelopment area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| Who is somebody who is going to be on a consistent basis looking at the plan, following up the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| doing the little work that's going to make it really successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| Well, I believe that will probably be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| No, nobody else stepping forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| No, actually, I do think I appreciate very much what you're saying, and it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| it's one thing to put a lot out here that does demand detail and coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| Not only we have coordination among a city of MPC and two city departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| because we have been working with community development on the facade grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| We will be working and have been working with MPC on the small area plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| and we also are working with KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| representatives are here tonight on the details of the tax increment financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| and other things that may arise with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| So I think that this will not demand the day-to-day attention that something like the South Waterfront will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2264)|
| 0:37:51| because of its nature, but it will demand a lot of follow-through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| and it can't be left to sit out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| It's going to need later to have a careful planning on when infrastructure resources can be committed to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| some of this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| But I'm confident that we, and Madeline Weil is here tonight, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| that in our department we can follow through and keep a watch over all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| That's a great concern, and I think you were at the last meeting, 5th and Broadway, way back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| and that's something that we put front and center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| and I think that's something we're going to talk about tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| We know we need to, if it's not one person, several of us, waking up and asking ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2305)|
| 0:38:33| how have we advanced in this plan because we have seen plans just kind of drift away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2313)|
| 0:38:40| And I will add one other thing to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| We have about as committed a group of people with whom we are working on this who are committed to coming to the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| keeping an eye on various conditions, and also working with interested developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| So we have a lot of help on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| And I'll just finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| It is a fair question, and I think everything they said is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| It's attention from the administration, but it also, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| is how much momentum that area and the people involved in it can keep up on their own as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| So it's all that, but your point is a valid one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| I really appreciate the comments of Councilman Woodhull and Councilman Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| and I agree with everything they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| I'm about to go maybe a little different direction because I do have some concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| and it's not about whether or not this should be a redevelopment area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| or about the particular project that's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| I think it's a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| It makes us all feel very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| But I have concerns when I look at the overall redevelopment area, and to be quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| about the I-275 business park, the old cocktail shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| and what this means with regards to accessibility to community development, block grant funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| HUD dollars, empowerment zone dollars, and façade dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| One of the things I'd like to hear somebody talk about is by including that in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| are we also opening up the opportunity for businesses that might go into the business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| to try and access the façade program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| And while I'm waiting on that answer, that's not something that's going to stop me from supporting this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| because I'm going to support this, but that's a grave concern for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| I don't want to have us back in accidentally into a PR problem like we had to begin this whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| with regards to that particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| We invested monies before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| I'd like for us to be very careful about that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| and hope that the private sector drives the development of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| that we don't take CDBG monies or HUD monies or empowerment zone monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| or monies meant for façades for buildings at Broadway and Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| and also we want to do it to have someone come in and bring their business into the business park out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| And I think it's part of this right here up in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| I think it's actually included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| So can someone address that for me with regards to the precedent we're setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| because we're not doing façade programs in this redevelopment area, which we should do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| and we're not doing TIFs in this redevelopment area, which we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| Are we now also now setting a precedent that we're going to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| or looking at trying to entertain doing those up in that business park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| We're not planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| And I don't the business park's not within the façade boundaries of the façade program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| There's no intention of putting it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| So the façade program boundaries are not going to be expanded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| No, they're not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Is there and I haven't read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| That's one of the problems that we've always talked about with getting packets on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| I have not read it cover to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| But is there anything in the document that says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| the façade program is not intended for, will not be used for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| Is there anything that's prohibitive language that says that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| So that down the line we don't have to segue into that when I'm, you know, gone, Bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| and you're gone and someone else looks and says, well, hey, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| we could probably use HUD money to go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| Those dollars should go for businesses and people and neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| and not into this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| So can we put some restrictive language in there that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| or at least expresses that intent that we're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| the intent is not to use those dollars up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Well, Vice Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| actually the façade dollars are driven by a totally different program entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| through community development and are not addressed by this plan at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| So, I mean, the governing document on them really is the façade boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| within community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| I'd be glad to speak with Ms. Rojero about making sure that that's in the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| Yeah, and she and I actually spoke when we were just talking really about some other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| about this was coming up, and I expressed to her the concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| and she assured me that that was not any intention of hers, not anything she wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| She did not think that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| And I hate to speak for people who are not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| but the essence of it was she did not feel that that was appropriate and wasn't her intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| But I get real concerned when I don't see it in writing somewhere that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| the intent is not to do this, it's not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| I serve on the county development board, and we want to make that park very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| We want business out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| But I also get concerned when I put on my community hat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| and want to make very clear that we don't turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| and use some of these very scarce public dollars that we now have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| to do some very good things in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| and on the peripheral neighborhoods with buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| and end up putting them into a business development park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| because we're going to get 200 or 300 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Maybe we should drive that through the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| or through maybe a tier 4 pilot, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| But I get real concerned about any ability to access any of the federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| that we have in those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| We hear your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| And one thing that made it jump out at me, and maybe someone can answer this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| I have a note on page one of the minutes from the public meeting of February 27, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| Someone asked a question, what about the $5 million in federal funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| And what were they referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| Did anyone know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Were they just mistaken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| And if someone at that meeting thought there was $5 million of federal funding that could be accessed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| what part were they thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| And I want to make sure that the community is very clear about what we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| so we don't inadvertently send a message that they're trying to come back around the corner to other federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| I'll take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| That actually is totally separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| That was a grant that we got through Senator Frist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| almost two years ago now related to transportation infrastructure for the I-275 business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2659)|
| 0:44:26| So that specific grant, we have, I think, a 10% match on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| I just wanted to make sure that my concerns were heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| I drove through there, not because of this particular proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| but a couple of weeks ago just to look at what had been done so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| And it looks very good, and I'm glad to see it occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| But I don't want us in the haste of doing some very, very good things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| inadvertently opening the door to something that could not be as beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Councilman Hoekstra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| I, too, want to thank the task force for their work that laid the foundation for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| and certainly the co-chairs, Councilman Woodhull and Dr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| and also KCDC for their work in putting together an MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| And if you'll note on page 19, it talks about a new zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| About the middle of the page, it says a new zoning code should be created for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| And it goes on to talk about the probability of form-based code being the best way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| And I think we've learned from the South Waterfront that it really makes sense to sort of put it all together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| and have a coherent whole package approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| I wonder if Mr. Donaldson, while we're on the subject, I know it's not before us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| but just so we have some expectation of how this package is going to come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| if Mr. Donaldson might want to speculate as to how the development of that code might go in terms of a timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2748)|
| 0:45:55| and what that might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| Well, we certainly have been thinking of that project in terms of our fiscal year 7-8 work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| So I would expect that we'll tee it up very quickly this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| What would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| We're looking at a form-based code for the downtown north Broadway central area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2774)|
| 0:46:22| So we're going to have some form-based codes in South Knoxville, Cumberland Avenue, Central Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2782)|
| 0:46:34| and we're doing the new R1EN, the infill overlay, the NC overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2794)|
| 0:46:44| There's going to be another base zone we're developing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Any time that we do a small area plan where we have a product such as this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| where we have a pretty clear vision of what the community is thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| I think we can translate that into the sort of mixed-use form-based zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| that we hope will be successful with the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| We're very much looking at it on Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| I think it's a way that many communities are going along their urban corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| I'll just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| I'm sort of concerned about how complicated the zoning code is getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| Some of it is my fault, but some of it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| And it just feels like I know there was some discussion a couple of years about sort of redoing the whole zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| and it almost feels like we're putting a lot of bells and whistles on something that at base isn't working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| and maybe rather than looking at doing form-based codes here, there, and yon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| and some additional overlays and some new base zonings, we ought to just redo the whole kit and caboodle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| Just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| Well, you know, we're faced with a very small land area in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2877)|
| 0:48:05| and we're faced with how we maximize its productivity, its livability, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2885)|
| 0:48:13| And I'm really impressed with what form-based codes can seem to do in a specific area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| where the need seems to be to revitalize and make it productive once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2901)|
| 0:48:29| And I think mixed use, you know, it almost feels like we've gone all the way around the circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2909)|
| 0:48:36| and we're back again to how I remember Knoxville, you know, when I was a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| And it was kind of a form-based code, mixed use, had the walkability possibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2924)|
| 0:48:54| and so many of the things that we talk about today, and I don't think you can do that if you're looking at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| codes that are going to be applied to a large area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| So, you know, I can understand that it seems complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| but I also think it allows us to take a certain area and have a vision for that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| and allow the residents and the people who want to buy into that area to be very involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| So I'm finding that I kind of like this approach personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| and I'm finding that it's a way, you know, we were standing on the steps of the Jacobs Building today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| and I'm just finding that it's going to require a lot of very creative thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2973)|
| 0:49:40| and land use to be able to put this city once again back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| I drove down Magnolia and thought this is this beautiful, wide, flat street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| Oh, my, how, you know, every neighborhood and every area of the city would love to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| So I think I have to congratulate Mr. Donaldson for being willing to kind of work with us, the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| because we haven't approached things like this in many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| and I just think the time has come when we need this kind of creative approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| I would note that NPC is lobbying us for more budget, and you just really helped them make their calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| Excuse me, Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| You know, well, I think to a degree it almost seems like, well, I know redoing the zoning code is going to be expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| If we're doing, and I think you're right, Ms. Pelow, it does sort of take sort of an independent look at every little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| it almost feels like the cost of doing every city in little blocks is going to be a whole lot more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| than just redoing the whole kitchen and boodle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| So there is a level where the budget constraints worry me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| I don't know how to comment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| I know we're getting off a little bit off the subject before us in terms of what we're voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| but I'll just remind council that John Fragonese, when he met with us in a workshop about two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3055)|
| 0:51:02| or I've lost track now, said that sometimes it makes sense to decide what you want to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| and what you want to change and kind of rework your zoning code accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| So maybe we can think along those lines in the future, but now I guess we probably have to get back to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3071)|
| 0:51:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| Ready to vote then, everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3079)|

| 0:51:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3088)|

| 0:51:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into an agreement with Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| rescinding contract number C050137 relative to the city's acquisition of real property located on State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3096)|
| 0:51:44| Approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| Could somebody refresh my memory as to how we acquired this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| Let me do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| And, Morris, you jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| Do you want to take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| You go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| Actually, the transfer has not occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| The contract was signed in 2004, and what it provided was that the county would transfer the property to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3121)|
| 0:52:08| and subject to FTA approval and funding, the city would construct a foundation that would support nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| and then it was amended to 13 stories of structure above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| The city would retain the fee ownership in the lower level for the possibility of the transit center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3141)|
| 0:52:28| and the city would convey to the county in fee ownership the air rights above that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3148)|
| 0:52:35| and the county would then construct its building and the air rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3155)|
| 0:52:42| And so that was the contract, what the contract provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| There never was a closing on the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Did we, for some reason, it comes to mind, did we actually swap some property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| No, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| Yeah, that's what a lot of us get confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| We actually, what we swapped, we swapped the old new Sentinel site down here for the 500 block where the S&W was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| and where we're putting the movie theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| We swapped those two pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| This was a separate transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| Two separate contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| It was all kind of in there at the same point in time, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Well, earlier I had talked to Dr. Lyons and expressed, you know, I'm just not big on giving anything away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| and he had to explain to me that it wasn't ours to give away, so I'm having to get accustomed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3199)|
| 0:53:26| I guess maybe my concern, and he tells me again here it's none of my business, and just forget this whole thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3206)|
| 0:53:33| But, you know, this is right in the heart of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| Well, he's my neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| He just talks to me like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| But this is right in the heart of downtown, and I said, oh, heck, it really worries me, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3220)|
| 0:53:46| what these country boys are going to do with this property that would impact us downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| And I'm kind of joking around, but I think you get the idea that it seems, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3232)|
| 0:53:59| it seems a little bit stressful to me that something that is just so close to our downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| that we have such an investment in right now and such great hopes for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| We're not going to have any, you know, say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| Mayor Hesselman, can you make me feel any more comfortable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Yeah, I think the reverse side of that is I think you have a county that for the first time in a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| is willing to invest dollars in downtown Knoxville and see something be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| and put back on the tax rolls, and they're out looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| and they've had a public workshop on the best ways to get ideas to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| So I understand your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| I think I would my reply would be I think I'm actually encouraged of how interested they are in investing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| in downtown Knoxville and get the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| Make sure we have this recorded and we can play Mayor's words back if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| I have an aye as a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with the owner of certain property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| located generally east of the intersection of Fulton Drive and Shannondale Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| known as Treybrook Village, relating to the resolution of a pending annexation lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| and the reimbursement of public improvement costs in an amount not to exceed $73,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| I thought about this a little too late perhaps for this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| but in the future on similar situations like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| see if there's the possibility that adding sidewalks as part of a structured settlement like this might be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| Oftentimes when you have a developer that has equipment on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| the city doesn't have to go out and pay someone to mobilize the equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| and we might be able to get new sidewalks put in in different parts of the city at a reduced cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3342)|
| 0:55:49| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| That's a good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| 7J is a resolution requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| to review the zoning designation of certain parcels of property located on Baxter Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| and give consideration to whether it would be appropriate to rezone such parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| from I-2 industrial to R-1 residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| Requested by Councilmember Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| Real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| These are a number of houses that they are zoned industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| and when folks want to try to get a loan when they're trying to buy them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| if something – industrial is one of the few zonings in the city where residential is not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3387)|
| 0:56:35| If a house burned, you probably couldn't go build it back without jumping through some hoops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| So we want to – the area is appropriately residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| It's just not zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| So ask an MPC to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| Tell me exactly where the houses are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| They are primarily on the north side of Baxter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| whatever the street athletic house runs down and north central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Across from the Sally Beauty Supply and north of the Catholic Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3420)|
| 0:57:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| Councilman Huckels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| There are pockets like this throughout the inner city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| and they're sort of orphaned residential properties that can't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| that aren't zoned residential and have the problems that Councilman Frost talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| And there are different ways that other cities have dealt with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| I know Jeff Tallman had sent me – and some of the other council members may have seen that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3451)|
| 0:57:36| sent a copy of an ordinance, I think, or a concept of an ordinance from another city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| And it's something I think we might want to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| I think Mr. Donaldson may have something to say about that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| I know Chipman Street, where the murders occurred, that was the condition there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| We've begun talking about that Nashville-Davidson County uses a provision in their code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| where they basically exempt or they create a nonconforming status for residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3485)|
| 0:58:14| in otherwise zoned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| And while the provision in the code is very broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| then they come back and follow it up with very specific geography where that provision would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3503)|
| 0:58:29| And we are to the point where we're looking at what particular geography we want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3509)|
| 0:58:37| Any other questions or comments there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| A rate of vote, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3520)|

| 0:59:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| I know that this is a different firm than we've had under contract currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| It is a different firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| We went to a new bid process, and this was the low bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| And by choosing the low bidder, which I realize we're pretty much obligated to do under many circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| are you confident that we've got the quality of service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| And the reason I ask this, let me frame that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| I know some of the parks, including some in South Knoxville, like Fort Dickerson, Duff Field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| have a security guard from one of these firms that comes around, checks and locks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| And we've had, in the past, we've had problems with performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| You know, go by there at midnight and the gate's sitting open, unlocked, you know, and various things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| And I know one of the challenges is monitoring them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| One of the things I've been told is, well, the people they hire is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| they're typically working for minimum wage or a little bit above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| So what do you think we're getting in this case by the process we've gone through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| Well, hopefully what we're getting is a very competent firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| and everybody that submits a bid has to be a competent bidder as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| One reason we did a re-bid was because we were dissatisfied with the last service provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| and so we went through this process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| You never know when you put something out for bid, what service provider you're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| And, truly, there is a maintenance and oversight responsibility that we have to take, and we'll follow through on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| Thank you. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3657)|

| 1:01:20| and the city to pay 20% of the cost, estimated to be $1,014,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3680)|
| 1:01:28| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| Mr. King, have these ramps been designed at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| So the first step is to execute this contract, and then we'll hire a consultant to do the design work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3698)|
| 1:01:45| Okay. I know that there was a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| I think Dr. Lyons is involved with that in terms of the ramps and Jackson Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| and various widths and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| So that's not ñ none of that is finalized yet is what I think you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| The reason we included the Jackson Avenue ramps in the previous public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3722)|
| 1:02:09| is because we wanted to see how they would operate with improvements to the 100 block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| So we looked at that from a functional standpoint at those public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| But once we get into more detailed design, there will be additional meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3744)|

| 1:04:06| That's right. So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| We really should have a special commendation for Candace Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| We should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| Because twice she mentioned Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| She did a great job on that stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3857)|

| 1:05:27| Councilman Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| There's not, but I know we have several folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| Gary Norman from our Planetary Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| Mike Stevens, who I think is head of the Home Builders Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| If not, he builds a whole lot of homes in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| If you all would like to ask Gary or Mike anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| I'm not sure if they have anything to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Do you guys want to make any quick comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| Is there anything you want to voluntarily say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| There's no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Just briefly so you'll know where we've been and where we're trying to get with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| But these are not all of the codes that we've got to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| What we're going through is a process by which we have met with all of the jurisdictions that enforce codes in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3958)|
| 1:06:05| which would be fair to get Knox County and ourselves to try to come up with a code that we're going to adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3965)|
| 1:06:12| that's going to be all the same so that our building contractors don't have to have a different set of rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| for whichever location they go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| That's probably one of the largest complaints that we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| And we're trying to go through the residential process prior to going through the building code itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| which would be the commercial building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| We kind of deal with a different set of builders that do residential building than do commercial buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| So basically over about, I guess, pretty close to the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| we have been meeting on a regular basis with the jurisdictions in our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| and have gone through the process of coming up with the amendments and all that we think are pertinent to the way we want to see the code adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4004)|
| 1:06:51| and enforced here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| Then we went and met with the Home Builders Association several times for lengthy meetings to cover this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4013)|
| 1:07:01| and to talk about their concerns and all and have come up with what we've offered to you for consideration and adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4021)|
| 1:07:09| The four codes that we're asking for adoption on are going to be the International Residential Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| the International Plumbing Code, the International Mechanical Code, and the International Fuel Gas Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| As I said, we're going to go through the same process with the commercial builders as we get ready for it for adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4039)|
| 1:07:26| Also, Mike Stevens is here representing the home builders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| and I think that he might have something that he would like to add to it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| Mike, anything you want to say real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Mike Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| I live at 916 Vista Oaks Lane, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| And just very briefly, I'd like to commend Gary and Tom and their staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| because we have close to 1,000 members now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| and any kind of change like this can have a big financial impact on our industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| Some of our members have one or two employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| Some have 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| And you hardly ever support voting change on yourself that has the financial consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| But for over a year, they have met with us, heard our concerns, and we stand completely in support of this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4087)|
| 1:08:14| And then the other hat I'll put on as a builder developer that's pretty much exclusively in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| this consistency that Gary talked about is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| I got caught last year by some trim carpenters that were used to trimming in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| and built about seven or eight handrails incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| They built them by Knox County codes, but they were in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| And we spent several thousand dollars tearing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| So this consistency of Knox County, the city, and Farragut, I think, in the long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| will have very positive consequences on our industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| And we very much appreciate the top-down leadership that has created this kind of dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| Mike made a pretty good statement there in terms of only building in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| As you know, most of the building that happens in Knox County happens outside of the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| Mike is one great exception to that and I think has more housing going on than anybody in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| We really appreciate the investment you're making and the effort you're doing to do things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Councilman Hawkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| First of all, how's your back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| Thank you for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| The other question is, so now that if we have consistent codes, assuming all the bodies approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| then the differences will be on the enforcement side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| So we can begin to better understand how to maybe have the conversations as we go along about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4169)|
| 1:09:37| how to become more consistent in those areas, too, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| I would assume that's what we'll hear in terms of dialogue with the Home Builders Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| to try to move towards greater and greater consistency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| still with the high level of quality control and, you know, assurances that come with the codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4189)|
| 1:09:57| I mean zoning, excuse me, building codes enforcement and approval that exists in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4197)|
| 1:10:04| But wouldn't you say that that's probably where we're hopefully headed is moving towards consistency there also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| on the inspection and enforcement side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| I would also say that we have done a lot of that with the year-long conversations that Gary referred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| because he's met with our membership and then it's our job as leadership to pass that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4219)|
| 1:10:25| And, of course, this phased in implementation that Gary talked about is going to give our membership a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| to see what the major differences are going to be before it goes into effect in December of 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| So we think it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| We think there's been great communication and, you know, we're ready to move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4239)|
| 1:10:45| Thanks, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| Barbara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| Mike, I just wanted to say that it's really been a pleasure to work with you over the last few years and get to know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4247)|
| 1:10:54| And I really appreciate the leadership that you have shown with the home builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| and it certainly makes our jobs and our positions a lot easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4257)|
| 1:11:04| And I just really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| And, of course, to reiterate what the mayor said about you building the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| it's such a refreshing thing to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| So thank you very much for your personal leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| Thank you, Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| Mayor, I just want to say that, you know, a lot of us when we were running for office and campaigning and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| we heard a lot about the inconsistencies and, you know, the need for clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| and that sort of thing and communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| And it's great to see the home builders and the city working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| and to bring the county and the city closer together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| And I think this remedies a lot of problems that we heard early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| So I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| Thanks, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4302)|

| 1:13:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| Questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| Yeah, I've got two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| One, in reading this, the first thing that came to my mind, I've talked to Director Martin about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| At some point down the road, I'd like to do a similar ordinance with some goals for local hiring as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| because I think right now so much of our contracting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| it's wonderful if we've allowed a minority contractor in Detroit to prosper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| It would be better if we had one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| So we'd like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| The other thing I want to just say about this, I think this is commendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| I think it's moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| It's voluntary, but it's setting some goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| And it just seems to me the 10% goal for saying that women-owned, minority-owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4439)|
| 1:14:07| and small businesses are going to get 10% of the business of the City of Knoxville seems like we're setting our bar really low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4447)|
| 1:14:14| And my sense would be that that should be a 20% or 25% goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| I know that's a way to reach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| But I think we have the capability to do that, and we ought to be setting our sights higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| I think it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| We actually met, we had our extended staff meeting Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| We talked about this specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| We have, as low as it is now, we've at least moved it higher than it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| We think we can get to 10, and then we're going to keep pressing to move that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| But your point's a fair one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| It's not a, but it's taken us a while even to get where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| But it's a fair point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| And I appreciate those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| I agree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| I want to thank you all for doing this and applaud the efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| A couple of other questions with regards to, I guess, expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| And before I get to that, I want to make sure that we're real clear that the reporting that's required here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| and the records we're keeping here, this is not going to replace the charter amendment that was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| where every May or so we get the reports from the city, KUB, airport, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4508)|
| 1:15:15| This is not in any way going to lessen that requirement or change that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| and we're going to still have that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| The Brown amendment is still in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| That passed 87 percent of the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| And also, going on to, I guess, page 4, B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| when we talk about the annual disadvantaged business report to the finance director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| community relations officer, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| Will that be in writing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| And hopefully maybe we can put in there somewhere the language in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| You know, I'd like to see more than just an oral report at council that all is well and we're at 8 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| I'd like to actually see the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| The documents does speak to having written reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| And I guess what I'm saying is that copy of that written report will be provided to council also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| I'm getting a nod from Boise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| Yeah, Larry, that is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| And with regards to page 2, section 2-1055, small letter D, line 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4566)|
| 1:16:17| starting with the purchasing agent shall adopt rules and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| as tested criteria and standards to define businesses as small businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| I think we need to take a look at that in conjunction with section 2-1057 certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| We've got one division putting a definition of small businesses together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| while we've got another division of the city, community relations office, which shall certify and deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| And I think maybe they should put that definition together, come up with that definition together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4605)|
| 1:16:52| as opposed to one department doing the definition and another have to enforce it and certify it, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| I think that just makes more consistent sense to me that the Office of Community Relations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| and I haven't talked this over with Mr. Strickland, but he may disagree and not want that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| But it seems to me that if purchasing is going to come up with that definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| they should do it in council with community relations, which is going to have to certify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| And then I see Boise's hand is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| We're going to have him speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| You want to speak to that now, Boise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Boise Evans, 228 Braden Court, Clinton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| In fact, on the whole ordinance or the whole code amendment here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| this was developed and then coordinated and staffed with the entire equal business opportunity program committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4650)|
| 1:17:39| and community relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| All of us together looked at this thing, made a few changes here and there that needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| So, no, this is not just the purchasing division moving out and saying one thing at odds from community relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4668)|
| 1:17:57| No, we work with them on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| So you all will work together on this definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| And the place for the definition, for instance, of small businesses is we talked about should we put that in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4682)|
| 1:18:12| And the reason we didn't stratify it in detail in the code is because it's a moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| As industries change and stuff, what's small today may not be small tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| So what we're looking to do that is in the procurement policies and procedures, which, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4704)|
| 1:18:31| are going to be staffed through community relations, particularly with regard to that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| So I can give you full assurance that, no, nothing in this regard is going to go out single-handedly without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4717)|
| 1:18:45| Let me ask another question about, I guess, application on page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| At the top of the page, numbers one, two, and three, where you talk about, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| giving a total amount of business done with minority-owned business, women-owned business, small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| Are we going to be in a situation where one business could actually be counted in all three categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| or are you all going to count a business as fitting in either one category and not the others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| For example, a Hispanic or African-American female-owned business could fall in small business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4751)|
| 1:19:18| women-owned business, and minority-owned businesses and be counted both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| So actually we would have one actual company but getting counted three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| So it looks like we have larger numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| No, in fact, Sherry Bennett back here who works in the purchasing division, she is charged with separating those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| And as much sometime as I would like to include them all and look better on paper, we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| We back them out and we call it like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| We don't count them once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| With regards to number nine on the same page, when you report that about the summary of how much money has been provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4787)|
| 1:19:54| by prime contractors, will you also provide that against a backdrop of exactly how much that total contract was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4794)|
| 1:20:03| What we do is we take the, in other words, the goal of, and this goes, I'm going to answer this two-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4803)|
| 1:20:12| because it goes back to what Councilman Becker said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| The goal of 10%, one reason it is 10% is because it is 10% of minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4814)|
| 1:20:22| and women-owned businesses combined within construction, within professional services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4822)|
| 1:20:30| within products and general services, each of those three areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4830)|
| 1:20:37| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| So just to say we're at 10% overall, that can be misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4838)|
| 1:20:45| You can be at 10% or above overall, but if you're not hitting all three areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| you have not met the intent of the spirit of the 10% goal there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| And the way we do that is we look at, for instance, let's take construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| No, let's take professional services where we don't do very well in that area at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| We divide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| If Company A gets a $50,000 contract for some type of professional services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4869)|
| 1:21:17| we lump that into the total of all the minority and women-owned professional service firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| and then divide it by the total of what was spent on professional services by the city for that particular year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4882)|
| 1:21:30| for that particular time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| I wanted to know, will we have the larger number to really see how the smaller number works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| And also you hit on something that I was going to ask about that I didn't think was clear here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| but from what I just heard you say, I guess it is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| and that is this will also cover professional services and contracting also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| I was thinking with the purchasing division that maybe that was outside your bailiwick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| So, for example, if we have some activity, let's go back and let's run the clock back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4912)|
| 1:21:58| and if we were building the convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| and putting that would be something that would be looked at under this proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| I'll give you a more recent example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| When I sat in those selection panel meetings with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| I will tell you that one of the point-blank questions I ask each of their major representatives of, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4931)|
| 1:22:18| the four firms on the short list is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| what are you going to do to help make sure that as the prime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| you move toward meeting the mayor's 10 percent goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| And they had to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| Okay, because we need a, I want to make sure we're getting a good comprehensive look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| And I applaud the mayor and what you are doing and what you guys are already doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| And I wasn't trying to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| I just wanted to make sure I had a good, clear understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| We haven't had a chance to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| And I'm assuming that this type of data will also be rolled into the overall annual Title VI report that comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4967)|
| 1:22:56| The same data will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| Councilman Huffman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| Just going back to Councilman Becker's statement earlier, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| this is not the time or the place to get into any discussion on it, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| But I'd be interested at some point, you're talking about a bi-local focus or percentage or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4988)|
| 1:23:16| I'd be interested in how that might work out and what other cities have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5004)|

| 1:24:10| Councilman Huffman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| Well, Ms. Sams was here, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| She just left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| She just left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| Well, I just wanted to point out to Council that she'd been patiently waiting the whole time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| and I guess she finally had all she could say out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| Anyway, I also wanted to point out, I think it's interesting that if you look on the GIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| it already shows this closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| On KGIS, I just looked at it and it kind of surprised me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| It caught me off guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| I guess they were anticipating our action tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| With that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5080)|

| 1:29:41| Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| My name is Paul Nesbitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| I live at 6605 Watch East Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| That's in the Cherokee Ridge subdivision in Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| I'm here tonight to address a serious safety issue that we have in our community right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5394)|
| 1:30:01| that being the closing of a right-of-way that we have been using as a public right-of-way out of our subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5401)|
| 1:30:09| onto Shod Road, which enables us to make a left turn onto Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5409)|
| 1:30:18| We really don't have any other way out of the neighborhood to make a left turn onto Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5418)|
| 1:30:25| Since 1998, when all the development started out with Shod Road and Lowe's and Home Depot and all of that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5425)|
| 1:30:36| the traffic has really gotten bad out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| The road originally was a result of an agreement with Victor Jernigan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5439)|
| 1:30:46| who developed the commercial property at the bottom of the hill there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| And when we had a negotiated settlement with him, he agreed to build the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| and turn it over at that time in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| It's subsequently been annexed into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5458)|
| 1:31:04| Not until last May did we realize when some signs went up that they were trying to close that right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5464)|
| 1:31:12| And we didn't know why we had been using it as it was a public thoroughfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| The neighborhood got all up in arms about it and come to find out that it never got dedicated to either the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5477)|
| 1:31:25| Now it's in private hands and they would like to close it because they want to put a business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| They don't have enough room and I don't know all the details to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| I do know that it's a serious safety issue for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| We feel that our lives are in danger trying to turn left there across from Lowe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| Any of you that know that intersection know that there's a left turn into Lowe's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| there's a left turn onto Shod, which you have to negotiate across, plus the Clinton Highway traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5507)|
| 1:31:55| I have a copy of the petition and some photos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| I'd like to start at each end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5517)|
| 1:32:14| I've talked to a number of people in city government, heads of departments and city attorney and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5534)|
| 1:32:24| sent you a letter not long ago back when it was still in the MPC process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| MPC recommended that the road not be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| Subsequently, the contractor or the developer withdrew the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5554)|
| 1:32:42| and told us he was commencing some negotiations with AmSouth Bank to maybe do a land swap or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5562)|
| 1:32:50| Apparently that didn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| And so a big sign went up Thursday last week, late in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| saying as of the 20th of April we are going to close this, quote, private right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5577)|
| 1:33:03| Now, I realize this is a conundrum for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| This is a situation that everybody I've talked to has not seen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5586)|
| 1:33:12| And I don't have an answer to the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| But I'm asking for a level of attention for our safety to do something about it somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5597)|
| 1:33:26| I know people shudder when you talk about taking over private property, but that road needs to be in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5606)|
| 1:33:33| It needs to be accessible to both the businesses and the individuals that live on that ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5613)|
| 1:33:40| And I think our safety is more important than the commercial interest of Cherokee Ridge LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5620)|
| 1:33:54| Like I say, I don't have any answers to the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| but I am putting it before you because it is an important issue for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| and we don't know what we're going to do if they do close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| Mr. Nisbet, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| And, like I said, you have been in conversation, so I know a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| And it is a tricky situation for everybody on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| This is a road that the county was supposed to accept after it was built for very --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| I've heard different reasons why they didn't accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| But for whatever reason, the county didn't accept it, so it never came into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| Later, the city annexed the businesses around there, but not the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| Not like any of the residents here live in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| So the residents are all county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| It's a city road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| The businesses surrounding the road are city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| The road was supposed to come into the county, never did, and it's still private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| So you can see the ticklish situation we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| We are going to continue to work with you to see if we can come up with a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| I don't know what that is either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| It's a hard one for us, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| But we hear your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| We understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| And we're not just going to ignore you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| We're going to keep with the legal department, engineering, and see what kind of solutions we can come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| We really appreciate that because we don't think there's a light at either one of our other entrances of possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5701)|
| 1:35:09| because one is just below a hill where people come over at about 60 miles an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| and the other one is at the aforementioned intersection right across from Lowe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| I think everybody on council can see this is one of those that there's just not an easy answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| But you have a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| It's sort of our problem and sort of not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| But we want to see what we can do to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| I will understand that top of the hill problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| But still, you know, a county life is just as important as a city life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| We understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| We just have a city budget to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| But I do appreciate your attention to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| We appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| That being said, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070410?start=5749)|
