| 0:16:13| Without the applicant, we can take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| Without objection, or do I need a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| You can make the motion without objection, give a second, or you can ask for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| Do I hear a motion that we defer until the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Motion is properly before us to move this to our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| One other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| This is sort of in the line of a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| As I occasionally go through my briefcase to weed out the things that have occurred over the last two or three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1015)|
| 0:17:04| I reminded myself that the city of Knoxville has been or is currently in some process of amending their rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1024)|
| 0:17:16| as relates to distances from locations permitted to sell beer and amending those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1036)|
| 0:17:27| I'm not here before you today to say we need to amend our rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| but I am bringing to you the concern that I have that where impossible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| beer sales in the city of Knoxville and in Knox County need to kind of look the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1056)|
| 0:17:46| I'm only saying that from the point of it opens discussion maybe next month or the month after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Yeah, I think they have approved that on second reading, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| I may be wrong, but I think they've approved to remove the distances from church exclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| I think we should tread a little bit lighter than them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| and I think that to protect the churches in the neighborhoods we could consider some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| get with MPC and codes and consider some zonings such as shopping center zoning or multi-mixed use zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1095)|
| 0:18:26| instead of eliminating the distance requirement on the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| We could possibly do it in certain areas where those are feasible discussions to have in regards to shopping centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| because there's a lot of churches that are going into shopping centers and movie theaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| And so looking at that is not to remove the whole blanket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| but to consider certain zonings that may help us in that endeavor I think would be more wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| I agree with the concept of allowing commercial access in shopping centers for churches as well as restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1131)|
| 0:18:59| and so I think it's something to look at, but I don't know about whether we remove the whole blanket or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1139)|
| 0:19:08| Also along those same lines, I guess one of the concerns that I have is that there is a way to get to a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1148)|
| 0:19:19| by using the state of Tennessee and going to buy the drink first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| and what we may have is a wedge which drives people to go to mixed drinks in order to then sell beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1166)|
| 0:19:36| when they just wanted to sell beer to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| I guess my question is to Coach or the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| Can't that go through BZA for a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| We had some, I know, in BZA reducing distance down, and I think we denied them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| Some we did, some we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| This is a beer ordinance which is not under the jurisdiction of the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| because it's not part of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| The second thing is that we need to be very strict on our distance rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| because once you waive one, then you can end up by order of the court in history waiving the entire distance rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1216)|
| 0:20:26| and we have just got our distance rules in alignment within the last four years again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| because of the waiving that had gone on in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| So you need to enforce your distance rules, whatever they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| or modify them where you can function without waiving distance rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| and I think it would be good for you all to have a discussion on what that policy is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1245)|
| 0:20:54| Is there any other discussion to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| If there be nothing further, we will convene as commission at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1259)|
| 0:21:06| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| Thank you, fellow commissioners, for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| I call to order this the December 2016 meeting of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1278)|
| 0:21:26| Madam Clerk, please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1286)|

| 0:21:52| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| All members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| public forum, the first person listed on the agenda, T. Allen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| Clough, to speak to the infrastructure and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| of Knox County, has postponed and wishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| to be on the public forum the month of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| Next is Mr. Jerry Harnish, Rural Metro AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| Mr. Harnish, your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| Yes, I'm Jerry Harnish, and my address is 1339 Grenoble Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1344)|
| 0:22:34| If you give me one second, I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| to get a couple slides up for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1355)|
| 0:22:54| I wanted to give you just a very brief update on Knox County's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1374)|
| 0:23:15| participation in the very severe fires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| we had in Sevier County, the end of November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| the first week of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| The first comment I'd like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| is how mutual aid works in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| And that is when there is a request that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| going to require resources to come from outside a county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| that request goes into the state emergency operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| center in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| If it is a request for fire resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| that comes back through the mutual aid system that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| is staffed by people like me doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| on a volunteer, extracurricular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| And that was done through the Tennessee Fire Chiefs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| If it is a request for medical resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| that gets routed to the regional medical control centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| The one for East Tennessee is at UT Lifestar here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| The resources that came from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| initially were an engine strike team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| That is a group of four engine companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| each staffed with three or four firefighters that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| are designated to respond in incidents such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| The strike team's first assignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| was actually to protect the visitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| center in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| And they were successful and given another assignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| and stayed up there pretty much throughout the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| Additionally, we sent two other engines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| at different times during the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| and personnel for the incident management team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| Joining us was the Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| They also had an engine on the strike team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| and separately sent another engine, a ladder, a brush tuck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| and a number of specialized resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| The last two members of the strike team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| were an engine company from Carnes and one from Harriman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| The essential responsibility after the visitor center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| was to protect evacuation routes Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| The strike team and other units were involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| One unit was pulled off to an assignment in Pigeon Forge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| They continued to fight fire Tuesday and Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| Most of the rest of the week was spent searching for victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| I do want to say that concurrently there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| were major fires both in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| and in other East Tennessee counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| one involving five engine companies in West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| and then again in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| And at no time did the commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| to resources to Sevier County compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| the ability either of Knoxville Fire or Rural Metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| to serve the community here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| I'm going to let Chris describe the operations of EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| I think the community focus has been on the fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| but this was also a mass casualty event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| and would have been news if it had happened in isolation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| but it did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Thanks, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| As far as Chief Harnish, he referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| the RNCC, the Regional Medical Communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| Center at Lifestar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| Early that afternoon, it was a really unusual day anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| We had had to support a couple of other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| throughout the day since our system was overloaded for EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| We got a call early that afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| And really the key points I want to take out of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| within 45 minutes of them requesting services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| we were able to respond with the chief and a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| of medic units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| What's really important for Knox County, I think, to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| is we have a lot of resources available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| whether it's Knox, Blount, and we can even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| go outside of our region down in McMahon County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Those are all AMR Rural Metro resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| And within an hour, we were turning away volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| that wanted to go help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| So within the first couple hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| we had a total of nine medic units there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| including four chiefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| We functioned throughout the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| and numerous hours went into it, over 700 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| We transported over 14 patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| Some of those went all the way to Vanderbilt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| for burn resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| And that's a huge accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| Our admin staff, they participated in every position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| from the medical command, both at Rocky Top in Gatlinburg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| as well as LeComte Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| which requested additional resources as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| So huge, huge event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| I'm very proud of my guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Very humbling experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| I personally spent the week there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| And when somebody comes up to you, and they tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| well, you can see they've lost everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| and they're asking you what they can do for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| it's pretty amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| One gentleman out that really stands to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| and gets me choked up is trying to find a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| to hang his flag from a tree when there's nothing left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| So I'll turn it back over to Chief Harnish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| He'll show you some pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| And thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1690)|
| 0:28:17| Thanks, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| We only have a little bit of time left under public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| So I'm going to run a brief video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| This was taken by the strike team leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| as the strike team left the visitor center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| and headed back through Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| The clip runs 56 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| But you'll be able to see some degree of the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| They were working with fires on both sides of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| and firefighters trying to protect the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1720)|
| 0:29:07| This is 321, right after the intersection downtown heading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1747)|
| 0:29:23| toward Crosby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| And this video would have been taken probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| between 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1770)|
| 0:30:07| That's the extent of it if you want to close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| A significant event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| What I would say is that the losses, as severe as they were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| could have been much worse had it not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| been for the organization and the professionalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| of the people that responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| So East Tennessee is blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| And I feel fortunate to live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| I know you've got a full agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Are there any questions I can answer while we're here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Chief, how did, you know, that happened so fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| And one of the questions I had immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| was how you guys were communicating with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| Outside of Sevier County, everything was working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| So communications by cell phone and radio were fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| There were some radio assets that were working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| The easiest way for me to communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| was actually by text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| That seemed to be the one thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| was working well for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| Most of my work involved trying to communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| with people that weren't up there yet to get them deployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Once they were up there, I felt like it was my responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| to leave them alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| Thank you for the good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1874)|
| 0:31:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1897)|
| 0:31:44| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Continuing with Public Forum, Gerald Westover speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| to Midway Road Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| Mr. Westover, your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| My address is 9713 Willmeret Road, Strawberry Plains, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| The purpose for me being here, well, first of all, I want to thank all of you for letting me come speak to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| And I do appreciate the firefighters' efforts, very brave men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| My reason for coming to speak to you today is to express my objection to the business park proposed for Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1939)|
| 0:32:29| I'm representing my family who has been in the community farming our land for over 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| I'm representing the future of our family who will come after us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| I'm also representing, as a member of the 8th District Preservation Association, the other members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1958)|
| 0:32:46| We object to this park because it is being proposed to be built on land which has been recognized by the U.S. Geological Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1966)|
| 0:32:56| and Knox County's own 1995 sector plan as being unsuitable for heavy development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1976)|
| 0:33:04| Knox County currently has in its possession 2,970 acres of land in business parks or in industrial parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1984)|
| 0:33:14| One of the largest, at 1,615 acres, is the Forks of the River Business Park, which is nearby in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=1994)|
| 0:33:25| It was founded in 1967 and much of it still sits empty despite only being 4.9 miles from I-40 and having a barge on the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2005)|
| 0:33:38| At this point, you have to wonder, is this a necessary thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| And when you look at it further and you look at the structure of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| which once again I state has been deemed unsuitable by the U.S. Geological Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| unless there was significant change, which none has occurred, you would wonder why you are going after the land to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2032)|
| 0:34:00| The Knox County Development Corporation, the Metropolitan Planning Commission, which Mr. Brantley I know is part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2040)|
| 0:34:08| and the Knox County Commission themselves has failed to really prove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| I am here as a representative of our community and our family and our farm to state that if this land is developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| with the knowledge that the karst land that it is being developed on is prone to sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| which would develop issues with our aquifer, could contaminate the Tennessee and French Broad Rivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| when the line undoubtedly broke due to the sinkholes, the sewage line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| four miles from the Midway Road site to Asheville Highway run a sewer line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2080)|
| 0:34:48| None of the residents can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| It has been pushed through by the Development Corporation, the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2090)|
| 0:35:00| and the board itself with nothing in regard to concern for the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| I was in a meeting with the MPC, Mr. Brantley remembers well and a lot of community members remember well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2106)|
| 0:35:14| where I asked when they presented their very well thought out plan on how they were going to develop the walking trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| the pavilions, how they were going to preserve the wetlands, what would be done to preserve our aquifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| I was told by Mr. Todd Napier and later by Mr. Ed Brantley that I needed to leave the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| that the aquifer would not be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| I left the meeting with Mr. Napier trying to stand in front of me before he even asked me to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| I was leaving because I felt I would get no answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| What I'm asking for tonight is that the Knox County Commission step in and stop the Midway Road Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2146)|
| 0:35:53| Not once for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| It's been defeated twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| It needs to be put to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| I'm also asking that Mr. Dave Wright either resigns from the Board of Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| or I will personally seek a recall petition against him and run in his position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| to properly serve the people of the 8th District of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| I hope that all of you will consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| Return me some kind of answer because if I do not seek a proper answer through Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| I will proceed to the federal level as I have contacted Governor Bill Haslam's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| and have an email in my possession stating that they show no interest in defending the people of the 8th District either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| I hope you all have a very Merry Christmas, and I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| Continuing with public forum, Afton Bain, and I'm sorry for the pronunciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2205)|
| 0:36:57| If you would give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| Yes, my name is Afton Bain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| My address is 1012 Turnberry Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| I'm in District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| My speech will not be as spirited as his, but hopefully you will listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| Thank you for all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| I'm here today on behalf of a group of your concerned constituents to discuss broadband access in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| particularly in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| In a digital age, reliable broadband access should be considered a utility like electricity or water service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2244)|
| 0:37:31| And as we've witnessed from the fires in Gatlinburg, it's critical for public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| Although Knox County has large telecommunication providers such as AT&T and Comcast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| there are still pockets where connectivity is low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| and your constituents cannot afford the expensive packages offered by such companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| Because of the need for affordable and reliable broadband, particularly in rural communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| Knox County residents have organized and seek to promote the installation of a high-speed, publicly-owned fiber optic Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| Having a locally-owned option will increase competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| and quality of Internet services in areas with minimum Internet access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| Furthermore, the money generated by the locally-owned Internet stays in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| instead of being sent to large corporations outside of the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| Each of the county commissioners should have received a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| requesting support of legislation regarding local determination of broadband and Internet services in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2306)|
| 0:38:36| As a resident of Knox County, I ask the county commission to put this resolution on the agenda for January for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| As elected officials representing our interests, you are vital to closing the digital divide in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| and can be the catalyst for positive change in our community-based enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2335)|

| 0:39:05| a consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2345)|

| 0:39:54| Whereas Fairgarden Elementary School, now known as Fairgarden Family Community Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2394)|

| 0:40:06| and whereas Fairgarden Elementary School was built in 1916| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| to serve children in kindergarten through eighth grade in the East Knoxville Burlington community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| and whereas in its later years Fairgarden became a kindergarten through fifth grade school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| and continued as an elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| and whereas in 1993 renovations were made to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| and the school became known as Fairgarden Family and Community Service Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| offering a Title I preschool program designed to broaden the scope of services to accommodate the total family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2431)|
| 0:40:38| and whereas Fairgarden believes that parents, senior citizens, and the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| are vital to the school's mission to serve children, empower parents, strengthen families, and support communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| whereas Fairgarden Community Center staff strives to serve their students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| by meeting their physical, social, and emotional needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| and empowering their students' parents to do the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| so that they can become productive citizens in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2462)|

| 0:42:08| I just have a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| The cornerstone of every good community, obviously, is its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| In addition to that, we have to recognize our public institutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2534)|

| 0:46:21| and hopefully some further discussion with the other folks who have an interest in the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2781)|
| 0:46:28| So maybe when we come back to you, we'll have a more constructive discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2788)|

| 0:49:24| Based on the discussion of Mr. Vandervee, do you have a motion, Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2964)|
| 0:49:31| I was going to ask him a question, but I'll make a motion that we postpone for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| Yeah, Dwight, I believe you had some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| I've got two questions, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Dwight, you had a meeting, or somebody had a meeting in your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| had a meeting with TVA or a discussion about placement of the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| what TVA thinks the lines are and what we think the lines are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| And so where were you at with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| Because I think there's kind of some discrepancy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| Well, the last, Jim Snowden met with TVA on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| and then in a subsequent exchange of correspondence with TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| they are claiming ownership in fee to the center line of this section of Lovelace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3008)|
| 0:50:15| And in that correspondence they did say that should Knox County surrender its interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| they wouldn't have any objection, but they wouldn't permit any maintenance work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| or gating of their portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| Obviously, if they claim in fee to the center line of the road, we can't gate half of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| Of course, you're talking about some very, very old surveys of record and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| and I think one of the things that the petitioners want to do is have an opportunity to have some survey work done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| look and see what those records indicate, potentially have further discussion with TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| and, again, I hope perhaps with some of the other folks that have an interest in this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| and maybe come back to you in 60 days and see what options we may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| I have a question and a point of order on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| If we do not vote in consecutive meetings, is it a second reading the next time or is it a first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3062)|
| 0:51:11| If there's no material change to the resolution, it would be a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| If you all have a material change that's brought before them, then, you know, it would be a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| It just depends what's brought before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| Seeing no further discussion, the motion that is properly before us is to defer 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3087)|
| 0:51:39| March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| Is it March meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| Is that the March meeting or February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| This motion would be to the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| February meeting, Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| That was really for the audience, the guys in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| Do you all have anything to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| I think you all live out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| Is February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| We'll make some notifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| The motion is properly before us to defer until the February meeting per the request of the petitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3125)|
| 0:52:12| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3134)|

| 0:52:18| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| Madam Clerk, do we have line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| There are line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Mr. Vanderveet, do you have just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| Can you tell me on the line item transfers what was the North Shore Choteau land and what was the infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3156)|
| 0:52:45| I'll let Jim speak to that, Commissioner, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| He's been the project manager on both of those, so we'll let Mr. Snowden speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| Is he capable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| He may be the most capable individual I've ever met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| I'll agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| Mr. Snowden, address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| Yes, sir, 205 West Baxter Avenue, Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| The question, are we moving money out of infrastructure and land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| Where are we moving it to, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| From North Shore and Choteau to Carnes Connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| That was a project that we budgeted for and actually spent less than what was budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| so obviously we're taking those savings and moving them into the Carnes Connector project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| just because that project is fixing to get started for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| So that's real savings that we were able to achieve through construction and management of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| Was that for the roundabout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| It was, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| That was the answer I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=3222)|

| 1:12:55| It's listed on page 16. It is accepting surplus property located at 2100 Maryland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4375)|
| 1:13:03| and known as the former rural high school issued by resolution of the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| Motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| Motion carries. Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| Page 19, resolution 406 is approving a lease agreement in the amount of $2,000 per month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| with John K. Chesney for the Carter Convenience Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| With that item, I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| Dwight or Tom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4429)|
| 1:14:00| Sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| I'm good. How are you this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| We would have an infrastructure sunk cost on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| I'll let Tom speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| Drew Thurman and Tom worked together to develop a proposal where basically what we would do immediately after acquiring the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4452)|
| 1:14:19| is simply put the entire perimeter of the property under fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| And, you know, I'm always reluctant to characterize anything that costs $10,000 or $15,000 as an incidental cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4463)|
| 1:14:30| But in this context, I would feel justified characterizing it as an incidental cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| And then go ahead and start by just adding open top garbage boxes so that we could increase the traffic and capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4475)|
| 1:14:46| while we entered the design stage and talked about what it might cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| Tom will elaborate a little bit more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| But we do think that some sort of phased approach might be possible where we just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4494)|
| 1:15:01| instead of doing the heavy grade work, heavy electrical, and that sort of thing to add compactors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| we simply add open top capacity initially just to get the facility bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| and to give Commissioner Wright and Commissioner Daly's constituents more capacity onto the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| The other numbers that we did pass out, and people were not seated at their desks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| so I just want to make sure everybody's got sort of the, we did an informal cost analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| just to give you some sense of what the numbers look like at Carter, make sure everybody's got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| It's got the annual cost to lease, or excuse me, annual cost to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| It's got our inbound tonnage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| And then it's got the cost of the lease as a percentage of the operation for the ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| So take a look at that, and then I'll yield the podium to Tom for the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4544)|
| 1:15:54| Okay. Tom Salter, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| We did a, I asked Jim Snowden just for a very rough, like if we were just going to pave the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4558)|
| 1:16:06| and it would be in the probably $300,000 to $400,000, and we can't take the paving with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| We do have to put in sanitary, and we would put in electrical conduit under the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4573)|
| 1:16:20| We would put in reinforced concrete pads and a concrete bunker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4580)|
| 1:16:28| at least the bottom of the bunker for some of our collection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| One of the things that we were, several things that we would do that would not be what we've done at other centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| where we have, if all of you have been to the centers, where we have these large retaining walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| we would probably build those out of concrete bollard movable material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| where you can change the size of your bunkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| We would do a modular office that could be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| All of our compaction equipment and containers can be picked up and moved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4614)|
| 1:17:02| And I don't want to mislead and say, you know, we could take most of it with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| but most of it would be built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| But one of the things we are going to explore is rather than build our stormwater control infrastructure under the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4630)|
| 1:17:19| we would look at some surface type of controls, which we have not implemented at other locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4639)|
| 1:17:26| but we would do that, and that would not be a built-in cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| That would be a surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| That would be on the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| What was the figure then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| Jim estimated $300,000 to $400,000 just for a paving job at the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| and it would be a little higher than that because we would have to do the concrete work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| It would be a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| Electrical, all that, you think it would get close to half a million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| Probably, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| Mr. Edwards, you spoke of, and maybe Tom, but you spoke of open container versus compaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4679)|
| 1:18:06| What do we lose efficiency-wise and cost-wise on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| Because we're probably going to take more of the containers in and out if they're not compacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| So what do we lose operating cost-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| I wouldn't attach a number to it, Commissioner, but we lose a great deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| and it is not a long-term or sustainable model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| You know, the sense I had from Commissioner Smith was he didn't want us to overcommit to physical plan improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| until we were absolutely certain there was not another available site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| That's something we could do for a year or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| but there is no sound business basis under which we could operate this way long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| Eventually, we're either in or we're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| We build the center, and we build it properly, and we gain the advantages of compaction, or we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| This would be an interim step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Long-term, I was worried about the efficiency of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| Yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| If I didn't make that clear, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| That would simply be an interim step while we gain control of the property and consider our other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| One thing, our discussion was so long last week that I didn't really want to touch on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| but I understand the concern over leasing versus purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| And in a perfect world, we would prefer to own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| In this case, Mr. Chesney is not willing to subdivide the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| Candidly, I don't blame him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| I think it would be to his disadvantage to subdivide the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| So that's one of those situations that it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| So we're looking at a cost of $24,000 a year to lease the property from Mr. Chesney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4769)|
| 1:19:36| So $2,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| Currently, we're paying for the much smaller parcel, we're paying $650.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| So, in effect, we're going to triple our cost and triple our size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| It shouldn't be lost in this discussion as you think about the cost of operating the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| Right now, we're spending and will continue to spend in excess of $100,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| to put the garbage from Carter in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| I want you to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| Right now, today, I spend over $100,000 to put the garbage in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| None of that's ever going to be recovered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| and that does not include the cost of getting the garbage to the landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| That is my cost to put the garbage in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| It's just an expensive business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| It is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| But I wanted to sort of share that figure so you get some sense of context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| that while we are increasing the size of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| and therefore increasing the size of the lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| the core expense to us is management of the waste stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| and that's also the core mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| That's what is important to constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| So if that helps set any context, I wanted to just go ahead and mention it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| and then I'd be glad to answer any question about these figures that you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| We continue to think this is our best option, and we continue to ask for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| Mr. Chairman, Mr. VanVate, the 47,000 tons that you estimate will come through there in a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4850)|
| 1:20:58| how much of that do you think percentage-wise will be recyclable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| that we can recover some sort of cost on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4862)|
| 1:21:11| We currently, for 2015, we've had two sets of numbers, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| 2015 and 2016 up year-to-date, which was 10 months' worth of data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| but about 347 tons was recyclables in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4880)|
| 1:21:26| and almost 4,000 tons was MSW or municipal solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| So I don't know any reason that that percentage would vary greatly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| though with a full and improved center, you might hope to see an uptick in your recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| But the vast majority of our inbound material will continue to be MSW or just straight-up household garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Mr. Chairman, were we able to negotiate into this lease a first right of refusal at the end of ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| if the owner does choose to sell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| I looked at it, Commissioner, and I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| I'd have to defer to purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| They actually handled the negotiations with Mr. Chesney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| We potentially could ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| I think we would have to have a first right of refusal to buy the property in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| That would be in its entirety, which puts us right back where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| We don't want to buy it in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| It has active businesses on it, two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| It's a much larger site than we need, and we don't want to buy all of it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| and I have to assume that whoever is in this situation ten years from now probably wouldn't want to buy all of it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4952)|
| 1:22:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| Does the lease have anything in it if he sells the property that the lease continues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| I'd defer to purchasing on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4967)|
| 1:23:00| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement, 1000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| Commissioner Smith, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| The gentleman who helped negotiate the lease with Mr. Chesney is out sick today, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| I do not know the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| I have the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| If you'll give me just a minute, Commissioner Smith, I'll be glad to give it a quick look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| I just want to make sure that we don't invest half a million dollars into this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| and we're told we have to be off of it in two years because they found a buyer that wants to use it for some other potential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5007)|
| 1:23:39| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| If I'm not mistaken, either party can cancel this after six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| I mean, it's just a fact the way it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5025)|
| 1:24:00| That is correct, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| It has a six-month cancellation that works both directions, both for lessee and lessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| I'll try to buy Mr. Myers just a minute or two of time since I put him on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| Ben Charble was actually the property management agent that negotiated this lease, so I've disadvantaged Matt just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5052)|
| 1:24:20| Yes, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| This is for Mr. Vandervate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| What currently is the property assessed for by Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| Again, property management has handled that for us, so we're less familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| We're obviously very familiar with the operation and less familiar with the real property as an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| I'd be glad to find out, but I don't know off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| The contract states the property is 8815 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| Knox County property assessor doesn't show that as a record as a viable piece of property at that address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5093)|
| 1:25:00| It probably has multiple addresses because it has frontage on multiple roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| I do think that the total property is appraised for $270,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5105)|
| 1:25:12| I'm doing this from memory, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Actually, I think I gave Commissioner Smith my copy of the appraisal, and I think that the property in total is appraised at $270,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5114)|
| 1:25:21| So that's for the 4.4 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| That's for the 1.69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| No, that's the site that we have in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| 1.69 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| No, I said the total property would be appraised considerably more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| It's about 135 an acre is what it came out at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| Okay, so it's appraised basically a little bit less than the 10-year lease, not including all the half a million dollars worth of improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5135)|
| 1:25:44| Dwight, this site is about a quarter acre smaller than our smallest site, correct, which is Dutchtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5144)|
| 1:25:52| Dutchtown is 2 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| Dutchtown is actually less than 2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| It is less than 2 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| Yeah, I think Dutchtown is, where's Tom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| Yeah, Dutchtown is slightly less than 1 acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| One of the things, yeah, Dutchtown is an extremely small site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| One of the things to remember about Dutchtown, and we didn't talk about this last time versus some of the other sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| and Tom actually has some aerials, but we decided not to try to put them up on the display tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5172)|
| 1:26:19| There is a distinction between what is operational and what we actually own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| For instance, at the Hall Center, we own an excess of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| It's the, I think it's 6 acres, the biggest property that we own in fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| but we use about 2 1⁄2 acres of it actually operationally, and the rest just sits idle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5192)|
| 1:26:40| So depending on the center, Powell, similar, it's got more space under a fence than it actually has in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| John Sevier has more space under a fence than it has in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| Dutchtown, 100% of what we have is in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| and at Carter, we would anticipate 100% of what we would have would be in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| Sometimes we've acquired larger sites than we needed simply because that's what we had to buy in order to get the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5217)|
| 1:27:03| And Tom, the 1.69 acres you had spoke of using some surface drainage systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5223)|
| 1:27:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| Does that give you enough site to meet our county codes for stormwater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| We've had a preliminary discussion with the stormwater department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| and they said there are some surface stormwater treatments that we can use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| and we may not have to build like catch basins and put in pipe under the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5243)|
| 1:27:31| We might be able to do it with the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| Okay. And again, I want everybody to understand that I have been to this site many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| and it is in dire need of improvement, and the people of the Carter community deserve a much better site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5259)|
| 1:27:46| I'm just trying to look out for the long-range picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| I don't want a commission to be sitting here in 10 years and we've got our hands tied behind us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| or whoever's here, because we've got a half a million dollars in this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| and the owner's telling us we've got to leave and we have to find another place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5280)|
| 1:28:09| Mr. Chairman, if I can, Mr. Myers found the relevant section to Commissioner Smith's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5289)|
| 1:28:15| and for the record it contains verbiage that neither one of us understands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| so we're hoping that the law director can offer some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| There's a word in there that neither one of us is familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| but it reads that either party may terminate the lease upon six months' written notice to the other party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| In the event lessor seeks to sell the premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| lessor must give lessee six months' written notice to vacate the premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| or require the new owner to attorn, and Mr. Armstrong, that's the word I'm not familiar with, candidly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| attorn to the terms of this lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5324)|
| 1:28:49| The lease would survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| If Mr. Chastney didn't give you the notice and they sold it, then what he's saying is that the lease would survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5334)|
| 1:29:01| It doesn't mean that the new person couldn't terminate the lease 60 days afterward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| because that's what the lease, they have to agree with the lease as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| So you're still in the same position you were before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| but with a different mindset of a new owner, which could be different than Mr. Chastney's mindset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| because he may want to use the property for something else that would probably cost a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| where under Mr. Chastney it would cost six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| Commissioner Smith, hopefully that helps answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5367)|
| 1:29:33| Tom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| Yes, just so I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| Let's say you're there for four years and you get a six-month notice and you've got to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5377)|
| 1:29:46| The majority of the investment you have there can be moved, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| Other than you're going to put a fence and some electricity in and you're paving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| Grade work, concrete, and asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| Just for the record, grade work, concrete, and asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| Those may not be recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5405)|
| 1:30:06| All your containers and your compacting and so forth, that's all going to go with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5406)|
| 1:30:12| All of that is fully mobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| We moved everything out of the fork site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| And your office is going to be a trailer and so forth, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| Right, it will be a modular type building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| So how much would you really be out, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| Well, all of the paving, the conduit, the sanitary system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5425)|
| 1:30:32| anything we put under the ground and then the paving, we would lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| And you put $500,000 on that number earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Probably, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| I'm sure I'm clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| A couple things also that I neglected to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| We actually have operated this site past the institutional memory of anybody on the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| but it has been there as best as we can recollect since the mid-1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| So we have occupied this space for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| I do understand from a conversation that Ben had with Mr. Chesney in between this week and last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5463)|
| 1:31:14| that Mr. Chesney was willing to eliminate his right to a six-month cancellation from the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5474)|
| 1:31:25| And so if Commission feels more comfortable with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| and more willing to approve it contingent upon Mr. Chesney signing a lease that eliminates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5489)|
| 1:31:35| retains our six-month right to cancellation but eliminates his six-month right to cancellation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| he has signaled a willingness to proceed in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| But we don't have that in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| That's just based on the conversation with Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| Again, Mr. Chesney has this property has been in Knox County's hands in effect for a good number of 30-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5507)|
| 1:31:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| Mr. Law Director, would any language like that carry forward if he sold the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| Would he be able to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| Well, if it remains as written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| the lease or without the six-month notice, it depends how you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| You'd have to rewrite more than just that one piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| You'd have to rewrite the transfer clause too to remain effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| I mean, it would take a little bit more than what we're just talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| But if it were as written right now and he waived his six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| but it still says that the other person would have six months to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| he would have to give you a six-month in writing or the lease would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| the buyer would have to honor the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| It would infer that if they give you six months in writing, they don't have to honor the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| So we'd have to look at the contract to try to get it to achieve what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| But I don't think as it's written it would achieve exactly what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| But we'd have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| I don't have it in front of me, and it's speculation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| Mr. Vandervate, when you all and Solid Waste made a decision to enlarge the Carter Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| did you all pursue any other properties or was it just we're looking at only expanding at the present location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5598)|
| 1:33:26| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| Purchasing did two separate RFIs, went to market twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| and did two separate RFIs describing the size of property that we would need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| the location of the property relative to other convenience centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| because obviously we try to avoid overlap and locate them within each area as centrally as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5621)|
| 1:33:47| and received no response to either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| Also, purchasing followed up and I think called the Knoxville Area Board of Realtors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| and had them list one of the RFIs on the Board of Realtors site to alert their membership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| to the fact that we had an interest in this, and we received no response to that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| So, no, we exhausted everything that we knew to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| Also, I think that they may have contacted a real estate agent or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| and just asked if they were aware of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| We've exhausted all that we know to do in order to find a site that fits our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5659)|
| 1:34:25| Is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| Before we vote on this, I would like to know if any of the commissioners are open to trying to amend this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5673)|
| 1:34:40| to where we can not be given a six-month notice, because if something does happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5680)|
| 1:34:50| and we have a six-month notice, if we've spent years trying to get to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5690)|
| 1:34:55| what are we going to do for the people of Carter when we're told you've got to shut down in six months if that happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5695)|
| 1:35:08| Commissioner Deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| What kind of time frame, if we amend the actual agreement, would that add to the entire process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5711)|
| 1:35:18| Would it delay it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| Would it add six months, a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| What does that mean when we talk about delaying it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| If we were to approve tonight the resolution that is before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5724)|
| 1:35:32| the amendment would take as long as it would take purchasing to contact Mr. Chesney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| and get him to sign removing the six months is the way I hear it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5738)|
| 1:35:47| which could take 30 days and could take 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| But the resolution would be, in effect, pending his signature to a new contract removing that six-month thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5753)|
| 1:36:03| If that circumstance makes Mr. VandeVe and my fellow commissioners more confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5763)|
| 1:36:11| in the fact that the financial position of Knox County would be better protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5771)|
| 1:36:18| I can amend my motion to include that the six-month portion of the notification be removed if it is agreeable with Mr. Chesney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5778)|
| 1:36:36| and the Attorney and whatever that hard word is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5796)|
| 1:36:42| That it remain or be taken out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| Be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| How it's solved on one hand shall affect the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| And those words will come from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| I don't mind to go back and ask Mr. Chesney that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| I mean, this is not a simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| I think Randy is doing a good job of making sure that the county is not losing $500,000 in a year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| I really feel uncomfortable with putting a pending on a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| I would rather defer it for 30 days, ask Mr. Chesney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| because in essence what we're doing is blindly voting on a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| and I think that it's more wise to defer 30 days, ask Mr. Chesney to pull that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| so we can see the contract we're truly voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| Is that your substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| Did I hear a second on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| Substitute motion is before us to defer for 30 days pending seeking a new agreement with Mr. Chesney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5865)|
| 1:37:55| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| Mr. VanBate, how will that 30-day deferral affect the contract as it's written right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5879)|
| 1:38:11| It will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5891)|
| 1:38:12| The contract as proposed is not executed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| Mr. Chesney has been a great professional partner to Knox County for more years than any of us are aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5895)|
| 1:38:22| He's always negotiated with us in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| and it was Mr. Chesney that brought this willingness to Mr. Charble to contemplate doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5904)|
| 1:38:31| I don't know that I feel licensed to go so far as to say he's committed to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| but he raised the issue that if it was that much of a concern, it's something he would consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| so I think we put it in front of Mr. Chesney this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| And if Mr. Chesney is comfortable with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| I actually think the changes in the language that the law director will have to approve are pretty modest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5927)|
| 1:38:53| and we should be able to have this back before the body next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| and it certainly wouldn't have any material delay on our ability to get the center up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| Okay, so what's the current contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| We don't have anything executed yet for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| We're under a contract for the .49 acres until August of 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5947)|
| 1:39:13| We currently, at least from Mr. Chesney's commission, we have for some years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| so we've got our 0.494 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| That is under contract to Knox County until August of 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| so we'll just continue to operate in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| So you feel comfortable with the 30-day, what we're asking for here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| I do, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| The substitute motion that is properly before us is to defer for 30 days pending addition of contract language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5979)|
| 1:39:50| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| I would hope we'll have it back in front of you next month amended to meet everybody's expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| Madam Clerk, I believe it's Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| Yes, it's listed on page 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| It is approving amendments to the Knox County Commission rules as recommended by the Rules Committee to, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| place the consideration of the acceptance of new county roads under Section G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| drives and roads, on the legislative agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| And, number two, add language to Rule 7, Section F, regarding applicant attendance for rezoning requests and appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6031)|
| 1:40:41| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| I hear a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| Seeing no further discussion, motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| Page 25, Other Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| The first item is Spread of Record, Knox County Property Assessor's Employee Handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| Also, Spread of Record, the Circuit, Civil Sessions, and Juvenile Court Clerk's Employee Handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6077)|
| 1:41:26| As the words are, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| I would like to make a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| One has to do with last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| The East Tennessee Historical Center had lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| They gave us an overview of their mission, the current projects that they had going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6099)|
| 1:41:48| The most impressive piece was prepared by an eighth grade student on eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6108)|
| 1:41:59| That's a word I had to write down so I could make sure I had it in my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| They support a lot of things at the East Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| On the tour, we saw the Truant Log Home, which used to be located near Beverly Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6129)|
| 1:42:21| On the right-hand side of Tazewell Pike is now inside the History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6141)|
| 1:42:27| Also, there was a streetcar, Knoxville, that was there right as you walk into the main display area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6147)|
| 1:42:37| The best that you missed out on, if you were not there, was that you did not get to see Davy Crockett's Old Betsy live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6157)|
| 1:42:51| But the most important thing the East Tennessee History Center did for us is they provided lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| and I wish to thank them publicly for the tour, their words, their work, and lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6175)|
| 1:43:05| Also, I would like to say we had lunch today with the legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6185)|
| 1:43:13| and also members of the Board of Education, of which the chair of the Board of Education, Patty Bounce, was here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6193)|
| 1:43:21| While we were in discussion, she has left us now, but she was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| And there was at length discussion of issues related to Knox County, the Board of Education, and the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6207)|
| 1:43:42| I would look forward to seeing the bills that are offered in the upcoming signing time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6222)|
| 1:43:50| and if there are bills that relate to the things that we saw as priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| we may have the opportunity through resolution to exercise our support of the activities of the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6235)|
| 1:44:06| But that's yet to be seen or yet to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6246)|
| 1:44:12| And then there is one last thing that I want to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| which occurred earlier this evening when we were given information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6255)|
| 1:44:21| that there are some 2,766 acres of available industrial land in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6261)|
| 1:44:32| I do not know which portion of Knox County that real estate may reside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6272)|
| 1:44:38| 2,977 acres, which immediately led into all of the vacant area that's in Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6278)|
| 1:44:51| The Development Corporation in Knox County own no real estate in Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6291)|
| 1:45:01| It is all privately held since the last piece was Mayor Ragsdale traded the soccer field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6301)|
| 1:45:12| with someone on up on Straw Plains to get good land that Knox County did have at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6312)|
| 1:45:23| into the possession of a trucking company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| And we, Knox County, got soccer fields which lie in the flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6328)|
| 1:45:34| It may not have, in some seasons of the year, been a good trade, but by and large it was a good trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6334)|
| 1:45:42| Knox County has no interest in the real estate that lies in Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6342)|
| 1:45:53| Continuing on with the Development Corporation for just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| and I will call on Commissioner Thomas or Commissioner Smith, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6356)|
| 1:46:02| The Development Corporation in the last two or three meetings have spoken to real estate sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6362)|
| 1:46:11| that meet the charter of the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| to have a certain number of jobs per square foot that pay a certain rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6374)|
| 1:46:21| that invest in Knox County with good paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| I believe last month it could have been heat treating solutions or some name like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6386)|
| 1:46:33| I believe that this month it was Magnum Venus products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6393)|
| 1:46:41| And I believe there was another piece of a business that moved from Rutledge to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6401)|
| 1:46:53| That name escapes me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| I believe it's something to do with corrugated paper that actually bought another couple of acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6415)|
| 1:47:00| adjacent to their site in Hardin Business Park so they could expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6420)|
| 1:47:07| The Development Corporation has a strict charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| They have to perform and they are assisting in bringing jobs into Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6432)|
| 1:47:18| Commissioner Thomas, can you think of some other information that may have come out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| the last couple of months of the Development Corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| Looking back on the last couple of meetings as you were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| the thing that sticks out so much is when the number of acres that was quoted previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6453)|
| 1:47:40| Actually, Knox County, of all the major metropolitan counties, has less available land than any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6460)|
| 1:47:50| I mean, Memphis is something like 1,500 acres or more or maybe 2,000 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6470)|
| 1:47:56| But we're less than 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| I think we're at 270 site ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| But the thing that you said that really sticks out is the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| People need to remember the land that Knox County does own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| it's just not somebody willy-nilly coming in and wanting to buy the land and put their corporation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| They have to have so many employees per acre and the pay has to be X amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6497)|
| 1:48:25| And if they don't do that and don't meet those requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| we can buy the land back from them at less than what they paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| Thank you for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| Commissioner Smith, did you want to add anything else from the point of attending the Development Corporation meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6515)|
| 1:48:43| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| This is just unrelated to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| I just wanted to weigh in to the point where we can thank people for their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6527)|
| 1:48:52| Most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| If anyone would have questions about the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| please ask Commissioner Thomas, Commissioner Smith, or myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6537)|
| 1:49:01| because we are your representatives to those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| Now then, continuing on with other discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| I just wanted to recognize a couple of people who attend every single month for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| And to start with is the gentleman up in community TV up there who's, I can't tell behind the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6553)|
| 1:49:20| but I think it's, is it Justin that's up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| And he's there every month making sure that the folks get to see our broadcast at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6563)|
| 1:49:30| And also the team that works the signing up on the second floor up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| I appreciate those ones attending every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| and they always make sure they have the agenda so they know exactly what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| So I think we should give both of them a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6582)|
| 1:49:52| Are you going to invite them down for a sandwich?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| I think the one in community TV is already aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6596)|
| 1:50:02| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| If not, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| Just to give my fellow commissioners a heads up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| I'm an active Boy Scout volunteer and Cub Master with the local Boy Scouts of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| This past year the requirements to pass from being a Cub Scout to a Boy Scout when you're way below has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6617)|
| 1:50:24| One of the requirements is that you, and some of you may have gotten these phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| meet with a government official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| Recently I hosted PAC 757 for a tour of the city county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| which met that requirement for the group that I work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| I found when talking to other Cub Masters and volunteers that they, a lot of them are finding themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6638)|
| 1:50:44| I have not necessarily set that up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| I'm working within our Topawa district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| and I will also inform all the other commissioners and other Scouts in the region to set up kind of an after-school visit here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6649)|
| 1:50:57| that would probably work at a time when this room is open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| just so that Scouts in the area who are way below crossing over can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| One or all of you will be invited to talk a little bit about what a county commission does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| and then to follow that up with a tour of the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| It will probably run, and I'm rounding this off, roughly 3.30, 3.45, probably until about 4.30, 4.45,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6673)|
| 1:51:20| a roughly one-hour after-school program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| So when you get the email from me about Scouts in January or February, that's what it will pertain to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| I just wanted to announce to everyone that this Thursday Mayor Burchett is doing a cash mob out in District 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6693)|
| 1:51:41| at Alvin Fry's Station, which is right there at the corner by Litton's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6701)|
| 1:51:49| He is going to be closing December 31st because he is not well at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6709)|
| 1:51:57| and Mayor Burchett is having this to say thank you to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| and if anybody wants to make any donations in terms of his care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| you can make your checks out to the Fountain City Lions Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| put on the check down the memo that is for Alvin Fry, and that will be gotten to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6733)|
| 1:52:21| So we'd love to have as many of you all that can come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| You can come to Fry's, and then you can go over and have dinner at Litton's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6744)|
| 1:52:31| Uh-oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| There being nothing else, we will commence zonings at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6754)|
| 1:52:47| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| I call to order this the December meeting of the Knox County Board of Commissioners to consider zoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6773)|
| 1:53:03| Madam Clerk, please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| Commissioner Gill. Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| Commissioner Carringer. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| Commissioner Smith. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| Commissioner Nystrom. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| Commissioner Schoonmaker. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| Commissioner Anders. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| Commissioner Bussler. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| Commissioner Wright. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6796)|
| 1:53:17| Commissioner Daly. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| Commissioner Thomas. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6799)|
| 1:53:20| Commissioner Brantley. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| All members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| All members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| Commissioner Schoonmaker, let me, let me, I think I'm going to clear this up because there's two things need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6806)|
| 1:53:35| First, we have in hand a removal of 4P16RZ, the next to the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6815)|
| 1:53:48| Page 27, the next to the last item, 4P16RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6828)|
| 1:53:57| A hand from Mr. Green stating that it's withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6837)|
| 1:54:13| Then continuing on, the second thing which I think you're going to address would be to take the 7D16RZ and move it to that spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6853)|
| 1:54:22| Would I be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| If there be no objection, that suggestion will be, modification will be performed on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6867)|
| 1:54:36| The very first item, 7D16RZ, will move almost to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6876)|
| 1:54:47| There is no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| Well, I was going to say something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6891)|
| 1:54:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| Well, I was just going to also say that since I'm the District 5 Commissioner and I have two filings this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6893)|
| 1:55:00| that I will be doing motions on both those applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6904)|
| 1:55:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| So we will commence with the 10K16RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6915)|
| 1:55:22| Now, before we begin to read the items that are before us, I have a sticky note somewhere that I have used to in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6922)|
| 1:55:41| I may not be able to turn it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6941)|
| 1:55:48| The way we have ordered our work for this evening as relates to zoning, the item will be called by the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6948)|
| 1:55:56| Next, we will get the stated action from the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6956)|
| 1:56:02| The applicant will speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| If the applicant is not present at that time, we will move that item to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6966)|
| 1:56:12| The opposition will then speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| Then the applicant, opposition may each rebut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| There will be questions asked by commissioners, and then there will be a motion and deliberation by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6981)|
| 1:56:31| So we have sort of a set of steps that we go through, and I will try to keep us on track with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=6991)|
| 1:56:40| So having said that, Madam Clerk, if you will call what is now the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7000)|
| 1:56:47| It's 10-K-16-RZ, request of Turner Homes, LLC, for rezoning from agricultural to PR plan residential at a density of two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7007)|
| 1:56:58| The property is located northwest side of Black Road, north of Ridgeline Drive in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7018)|
| 1:57:04| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| Arthur Seymour, Jr., I am here on behalf of the applicant, Turner Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7028)|
| 1:57:13| Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| The Metropolitan Planning Commission, by consent, recommended approval of the PR zoning for this 2.04-acre property at a density of 1.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7037)|
| 1:57:28| The area surrounding the requested property is developed with agricultural, rural, residential, and low-density residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7048)|
| 1:57:36| It's located within the urban growth boundary of the town of Thurigood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| The historic development pattern along Black Road is lot sizes of one acre or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| That is the reason for the recommendation that the rezoned PR at a density of 1.5 units per acre rather than the two units per acre requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7065)|
| 1:57:57| Again, the MPC recommended approval of this rezoning by consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7086)|
| 1:58:12| Mr. Seymour, do you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7092)|
| 1:58:16| Our client is in agreement with the MPC recommendation of 1.5 units per acre and would request approval on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7096)|
| 1:58:26| Motion to approve for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| The motion is properly before us to approve for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7110)|
| 1:58:36| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| 11-A-16-SP is a request of Daniel and Gracie Cass Living Trust for Northeast County Sector Plan Amendment from LDR, low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7125)|
| 1:58:55| to RC Rural Commercial located southeast side of Millartown Pike, northeast side of Ellis Town Road in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7135)|

| 1:59:06| Sir, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| It's David L. Cass, 4806 Shannon Run Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7149)|
| 1:59:14| I'm representing the Cass Trust Estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7154)|
| 1:59:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7158)|
| 1:59:19| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| The Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended the Sector Plan Amendment to designate this as RC Rural Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7162)|
| 1:59:32| There's currently CA zoning at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| This is a node of two arterial roads and the plan designation requested would be in compliance with the sector plan for the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7176)|
| 1:59:46| and would recognize the identification of the area as a commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| The MPC recommended this by consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7191)|
| 1:59:56| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7196)|
| 2:00:00| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| Seeing none, I make a motion that this be approved per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7204)|
| 2:00:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| Thank you, sir, and good luck with your endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7222)|
| 2:00:27| Continuing on, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| The next item is 11-B-16RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| It's a request of Daniel and Grace E. Cass Living Trust for rezoning from A. Agricultural and C.A. General Business to C.R. Rural Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7232)|
| 2:00:40| The property description is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| Pardon me for making a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7244)|
| 2:00:48| The applicant is still present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| I can understand your move there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7255)|
| 2:00:58| When I first came here, I could never understand why it took two steps to do something, but I'm beginning to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7258)|
| 2:01:03| And then this is the second step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| The first was a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| This is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| Again, this has been designated as a commercial node, and the sector plan, a portion of the property, is currently zoned C.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7269)|
| 2:01:17| The requested zoning to rural commercial would be in compliance with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| and would allow the development of the commercial node there as envisioned by the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7281)|
| 2:01:27| The Planning Commission did recommend by consent that this zoning change be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7287)|
| 2:01:37| Trying to be consistent, I will ask if there is any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7297)|
| 2:01:43| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7303)|
| 2:01:49| Seeing none and seeing no further discussion, I move that this be approved per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7309)|
| 2:01:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7318)|
| 2:02:01| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7321)|
| 2:02:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7324)|
| 2:02:05| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7329)|
| 2:02:10| 11-C-16-RZ is a request of Hutchins Associates PC for rezoning from a agricultural to RA low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7330)|
| 2:02:19| property located north side of Gray Hendricks Road, west of Tawassee Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7339)|
| 2:02:26| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| Name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| David Hutchins and 4625 Newcomb Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7353)|
| 2:02:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| This is a 0.6-acre site on which the applicants wish to develop residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7363)|
| 2:02:49| The Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended by consent that the rezoning to RA low-density residential be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7369)|
| 2:02:57| They found that it would be a logical extension of the zoning from the south and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| It is consistent with the sector plan designation and would permit development compatible with the surrounding land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7381)|
| 2:03:09| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7389)|
| 2:03:12| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7392)|
| 2:03:16| Seeing no further discussion, do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7396)|
| 2:03:20| I make a motion to approve for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| Mr. Hutchins, it is 0.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| What is the plan for the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| It is to probably subdivide and seek a use under review on the one portion of it for a duplex and a single family probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7415)|
| 2:03:48| On the remainder, the same owner owns the property immediately to the west of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7428)|
| 2:03:55| That is an equivalent size that we have already been through a use under review process there, and that was approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7435)|
| 2:04:06| So on that property, we will be doing a duplex on the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| The front of that, due to the easement access across that property, reduces the square footage of the front lot area on that one to below 12,000 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7450)|
| 2:04:22| not allowing for a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| These are on public sewer, so the lot size for a duplex would be 12,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7464)|
| 2:04:32| We went to BCA last month and did not get approval for a reduction in lot size for a duplex on the front of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7472)|
| 2:04:41| but we do have approval for a single family on the front of the contiguous property and a duplex at the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7481)|
| 2:04:49| I had master planned both of these together to do the same thing on each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7489)|
| 2:04:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7496)|
| 2:05:01| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to approve for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7501)|
| 2:05:09| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| Thank you, Mr. Hutchings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7516)|

| 2:06:32| The MPC recommended rezoning at a density of up to three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7592)|
| 2:06:37| finding that the reduced density would be compatible with the surrounding land uses and with the sector plan for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7597)|
| 2:06:47| There is one condition attached to the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| and that is that no clearing or grading of the site be permitted prior to approval of the use of an on-review plan by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7610)|
| 2:06:59| Again, the vote is 14-0 with one abstention for rezoning for up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7619)|
| 2:07:09| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7629)|

| 2:11:06| One of the issues that arose during the review of this was the ability to widen Millstone Lane to the required 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7866)|
| 2:11:16| given the somewhat restrictive right-of-way in the area of the intersection of Millstone Lane and Friel's Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7876)|
| 2:11:23| The applicant provided a survey and the neighboring property owners provided a survey which provided varying widths for that right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7883)|
| 2:11:34| The county engineering department then contracted with one of their consultant surveyors to provide a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7894)|
| 2:11:41| The consensus was that the right-of-way width in that area at its most restrictive point is 36 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7901)|
| 2:11:49| Upon receiving the survey and that information, the staff requested a roadway grading plan for the proposed extension or proposed widening of Millstone Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7909)|
| 2:12:01| That plan was attached to your packet and shows that the improvements can be accommodated within the right-of-way as shown on the surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7921)|
| 2:12:10| The attorney for the neighboring property owners has argued that there's no record of the transfer of that right-of-way to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7930)|
| 2:12:20| and Knox County engineering has stated that they maintain the pavement but nothing other than the pavement in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7940)|
| 2:12:27| That is one question that will be before the commission tonight, and I'm sure both sides in this request will have varying interpretations of the ownership of that right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7947)|
| 2:12:37| The information we have from the county engineering department is that that right-of-way is in existence and is available for the widening of Millstone Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7957)|
| 2:12:48| Another issue in this is that it is within a parental responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7968)|
| 2:12:54| It is within walking distance of West Valley Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7974)|
| 2:12:59| One of the reasons for the MPC recommending the density is that it's proximity to that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| The applicant has agreed to provide a sidewalk both internal to the development and along Millstone Lane from the development entrance to the end of the existing sidewalk on Millstone Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7984)|
| 2:13:16| There are a number of different types of development in the area, ranging from lots as small as 5,000 square feet to lots of more than two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=7996)|
| 2:13:26| It's a challenging property on which to make a recommendation because it meets several of the planning standards for higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8006)|
| 2:13:35| being in an area with mixed density, an area with infrastructure, an area close to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| Staff does recognize the existence of the larger lots next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8020)|
| 2:13:45| It's tried to look at varying ways of making the transition of buffer from the existing development to the proposed smaller lots in the new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8025)|
| 2:13:54| I'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8034)|
| 2:13:59| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| Those that wish to identify yourselves, please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8044)|
| 2:14:09| I'm Britton Collins, 550 Main Street, and I represent probably almost everybody left in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8049)|
| 2:14:16| I don't know if you want to have them all come up and identify themselves so they can stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8056)|
| 2:14:22| These are the community members who join in opposition to the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8062)|
| 2:14:27| Right, and if anyone at any point in time wishes to speak later on, they may identify themselves at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8067)|
| 2:14:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| Counselor Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8081)|
| 2:14:42| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I am here on behalf of S&E Properties, the applicant herein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8082)|
| 2:14:51| The applicant requested originally five dwelling units per acre for this 40-acre tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8091)|
| 2:15:01| After discussions with MPC and after its receipt of its recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8101)|
| 2:15:06| it agreed to three units per acre, which is the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| There are three conditions on that recommendation, and I'll come back to those in a minute if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8112)|
| 2:15:19| As Mr. Green has pointed out, this 40-acre tract is in a sector plan that has low-density residential designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8119)|
| 2:15:32| Under that sector plan, the density for a residential development could be up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8132)|
| 2:15:41| We are in agreement with MPC on the density, which is three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8141)|
| 2:15:46| which is considerably less than what the sector plan would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8146)|
| 2:15:52| There are in the neighborhood, if you look at the zoning maps around there, there's medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8152)|
| 2:16:00| maybe even high-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| There is very low-density residential, several lots that are an acre or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8163)|
| 2:16:10| And then there are a number of small lots along there, all of which have been built upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8170)|
| 2:16:16| So you have a mixed zoning picture there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| But we are asking for something that is compliant with the Knox County sector plan, which is approved for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8179)|
| 2:16:30| As Mr. Green pointed out, just to the east of this property is the West Valley Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8190)|
| 2:16:38| And as you all have learned from building schools in this county, a middle school, elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8198)|
| 2:16:47| or a high school is a magnet for homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| People love to have a home, those with children, close to a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8211)|
| 2:16:57| Look only at Hardin Valley and at Gibbs to see what is happening in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8217)|
| 2:17:03| So there is a demand for housing in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8223)|
| 2:17:08| Today, builders are finding that not everybody likes the large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8228)|
| 2:17:14| As a matter of fact, the preference for most families today is for smaller lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8234)|
| 2:17:20| where they do not have to have all the maintenance available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| MPC has recommended or has conditioned this zoning on our clients widening Millstone Lane to the entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8244)|
| 2:17:35| or at least getting adequate right-of-way to widen the road within the existing right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8255)|
| 2:17:42| and to put a five-foot sidewalk in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8262)|
| 2:17:45| There has been somewhat of a battle of surveyors leading up to the MPC action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8265)|
| 2:17:52| Our client had a survey, neighbors had a survey, and then Knox County Engineering looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8272)|
| 2:17:59| As I understand now, Knox County Engineering is satisfied that there is adequate county right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8279)|
| 2:18:06| for the road to be widened to the entrance to this subdivision and for a five-foot sidewalk to be put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8286)|
| 2:18:15| I understand the opponents may disagree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8295)|
| 2:18:19| but that's not an issue really for this commission, I suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8299)|
| 2:18:24| It's an issue for the Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| If they're battling surveys, Chancery Court is the place to decide that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8306)|
| 2:18:32| We are here before you on a land use issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| And the land use issue is, is this an appropriate place to put a subdivision for 100 homes or more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8316)|
| 2:18:47| And I think Knox County, by adopting the sector plan, which I think was adopted unanimously for this area, has already said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8327)|
| 2:18:56| This is an appropriate place for a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8336)|
| 2:19:00| All utilities are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8340)|
| 2:19:03| The condition that the road be widened prior to subdividing this property is adequate protection for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8343)|
| 2:19:13| and the neighboring property owners that the road will be adequate for this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8353)|
| 2:19:19| This is really an infill development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| If you look around the area, you will see a lot of development just to the east on Ebenezer, George Williams Road, and other roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8362)|
| 2:19:31| To the south, you have Gettysview and other subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8371)|
| 2:19:38| Really, the newer growth in West Knox County has gone well beyond this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8378)|
| 2:19:44| But this is a prime piece of property for infill development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8384)|
| 2:19:50| And that's what we're asking you all to approve tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| This is what MPC staff has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| And this is what the planning commission itself unanimously recommended to you all here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8399)|
| 2:20:07| We would like to discuss the conditions so that they're not quite as stringent as you've got to put an acre lot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8407)|
| 2:20:18| We think we can accomplish the same protections for the large lots on the south of Millstone Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8418)|
| 2:20:25| by using a conservation easement on that perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8425)|
| 2:20:29| And we would like to have that flexibility to work with MPC on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8429)|
| 2:20:34| because we are asking for a planned zone, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8434)|
| 2:20:40| Now, this is the first step in that process, the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8440)|
| 2:20:46| If you approve this zoning, we do not have the right to turn a spade of dirt out there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8446)|
| 2:20:53| We have to go back to the planning commission with a concept plan and a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8453)|
| 2:21:01| And that will go to a public meeting of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| where there will be debate on lot location, detention facilities, utility location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8465)|
| 2:21:14| and all the other issues that go into developing a subdivision in Knox County today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8474)|
| 2:21:21| So I suggest perhaps conditions one and two ought to be modified somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8481)|
| 2:21:28| or eliminated to give us flexibility to put a conservation easement on those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8488)|
| 2:21:35| But at this time tonight, we are asking you to approve what MPC staff recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8495)|
| 2:21:45| what the full planning commission unanimously recommended, zoning in which your all sector plan recommends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8505)|
| 2:21:53| zoning at one to three units per acre for this 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8513)|
| 2:21:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| Councilor Collins, I believe that was in running was about seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8521)|
| 2:22:11| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8531)|
| 2:22:13| 722 to 729.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8533)|
| 2:22:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8540)|
| 2:22:21| Britton Collins, 550 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| Again, I'm here on behalf of this large group of homeowners, community members, and constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8543)|
| 2:22:29| who are concerned about this development and what it will do to the fabric of this micro neighborhood that exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8549)|
| 2:22:39| and maybe the last micro neighborhood of its nature in West Knox County, particularly in the West Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8559)|
| 2:22:47| They come to you to ask you to listen to those concerns in the hopes that you will give them the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8567)|
| 2:22:54| to have a voice in what the development of that neighborhood will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8574)|
| 2:22:59| I think there's a misconception that because we're here, because we're opposing this particular development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8579)|
| 2:23:06| and because we've been so vocal that somehow that makes us anti-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8586)|
| 2:23:12| But that's not what we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| We are pro the right kind of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8594)|
| 2:23:19| And when we talk about the right kind of development for this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8599)|
| 2:23:23| we have to think about it in the context of the particular neighborhood that it sits in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8603)|
| 2:23:27| And that's particularly so when we think about the fact that they're asking for a planned residential zoning designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8607)|
| 2:23:33| which under the PR guidelines requires for it to be compatible with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8613)|
| 2:23:39| Now, yes, if you zoom the picture out far enough, you're going to find denser subdivisions in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8619)|
| 2:23:45| but we're not talking about the entirety of West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| We're talking about the neighborhood of Millstone and Freels Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8628)|
| 2:23:54| And what does that neighborhood look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| It's Millstone Lane, which is an 18-foot wide local road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8636)|
| 2:24:02| It's a dead end, services 20 to 25 homes, all of which are large lot agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8642)|
| 2:24:10| None are smaller than two acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8650)|
| 2:24:14| Some of them are as large as 15 acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8654)|
| 2:24:17| And they're all accessed, again, by one 18-foot dead end road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8657)|
| 2:24:24| So what makes this wrong for that setting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8664)|
| 2:24:29| Well, one is that the applicants requested a rezoning of 40 acres of property from agricultural to planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8669)|
| 2:24:36| but included within that 40 acres is a substantial amount of property that's already been rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8676)|
| 2:24:42| That includes the property of the current owner, Eddie Daniel, which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| according to the concept plan that's been filed by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| will sit on about five acres that won't truly be included within the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8690)|
| 2:24:55| Similarly, there's the property of his, or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8695)|
| 2:24:58| the home of his brother that sits on approximately one acre of land that's also included within the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8698)|
| 2:25:04| or included, excuse me, within the rezoning request, but not actually included within the subdivision itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8704)|
| 2:25:11| So the 40 acres is really more like 34 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8711)|
| 2:25:15| And so that's issue number one, is that the numbers aren't even really accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8715)|
| 2:25:21| when they talk about what's the total development going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8721)|
| 2:25:25| They say 40, but it's really 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| And the obvious point of why they did that was to dilute the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8728)|
| 2:25:31| so that they can shift the homes that they would have put on those properties onto other properties elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8731)|
| 2:25:38| so that they can get their 136 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| Another issue, as has been suggested strongly, is the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8742)|
| 2:25:48| Now, a number of you have been out to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8748)|
| 2:25:51| I suspect that the vast majority of you have been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| You understand the constraints that the existing infrastructure has on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8754)|
| 2:25:59| Now, county engineering and MPC have said that if there's going to be a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8759)|
| 2:26:03| above one dwelling unit per acre on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8763)|
| 2:26:06| then it's going to require roadway improvements to include a widening of Millstone Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8766)|
| 2:26:11| and the addition of a sidewalk from the existing improvements to the east to the entrance of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8771)|
| 2:26:19| So the question then gets asked, is there a right-of-way to allow those improvements to take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8779)|
| 2:26:25| And I will respectfully disagree with Mr. Seymour that this is just a matter of conflicting right-of-ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8785)|
| 2:26:33| or, excuse me, conflicting surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| What this is is there is a lack of any documentation anywhere in the county records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8795)|
| 2:26:41| showing that there is 36 to 40 feet of right-of-way along Millstone Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8801)|
| 2:26:47| It simply doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| And the county engineering department has relied on these surveys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8809)|
| 2:26:55| but has yet to point to a single document whereby that right-of-way has been dedicated to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8815)|
| 2:27:01| In the absence of that right-of-way, the road can't be improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8821)|
| 2:27:05| and if the road can't be improved, you can't get density above one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8825)|
| 2:27:12| One dwelling unit per acre can be achieved at the current zoning designation of agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8832)|
| 2:27:18| So we would submit as a first point that there's really no need for a rezoning of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8838)|
| 2:27:24| There's really no ability to rezone the property at a density above one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8844)|
| 2:27:29| because they're never going to be able to get the infrastructure improvements in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8849)|
| 2:27:34| Now, they've also not addressed the concern of the community here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8854)|
| 2:27:43| about the impact that this subdivision would have on the fabric of the existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8863)|
| 2:27:49| The folks here, they bought into a large lot lifestyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8869)|
| 2:27:55| This, as I mentioned, is kind of a micro-neighborhood within West Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8875)|
| 2:28:01| but Mr. Seymour says, well, people don't want to live on large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8881)|
| 2:28:05| Young families don't want to live on these large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| We disagree, and it's telling that Mr. Seymour was here just a few minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8890)|
| 2:28:16| on a rezoning request for Turner Homes where they asked for planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8896)|
| 2:28:20| in West Knox County at 1.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| So if nobody wants that, how are his clients requesting that kind of a zoning designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8904)|
| 2:28:32| We're not anti-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| We want the correct type of development in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8914)|
| 2:28:38| and the community members are very concerned that this particular zoning designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8918)|
| 2:28:44| this particular density doesn't meet the planned residential guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8924)|
| 2:28:49| of being compatible with their existing densities in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8929)|
| 2:28:54| And again, of course, if you zoom out the map far enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8934)|
| 2:28:58| Mr. Seymour is going to show you what you want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| But we have to look at this neighborhood as really something unique and special on its own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8941)|
| 2:29:07| and the community members would ask that you all respect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| and help them to preserve what they have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8955)|
| 2:29:20| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8960)|
| 2:29:24| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'm sorry I went over my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8964)|
| 2:29:27| I was not keeping an eye on the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| Let me just point out several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| The MPC will not let a lot be sold or planted in the subdivision until the infrastructure is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8972)|
| 2:29:42| That is, the road has been widened and the sidewalk in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8982)|
| 2:29:48| Second, Mr. Daniels, who is here, is the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8988)|
| 2:29:53| He has lived out there and will continue to live there, along with his brother, who lives in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=8993)|
| 2:30:04| His lot, unfortunately, he says, is not five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9004)|
| 2:30:07| It's much smaller than that, and his brother's is much smaller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9007)|
| 2:30:14| There is no incompatibility, I suggest to you, between neighborhoods with large lots and nearby small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9014)|
| 2:30:25| As a matter of fact, Caddy Corner, across from this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| is a planned residential condo development that has been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9028)|
| 2:30:36| These people have large lots just a short distance away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9036)|
| 2:30:40| There's no incompatibility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| You look at some of the older neighborhoods in town that have held their value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9042)|
| 2:30:48| Sequoia Hills being the prime example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| They have apartments in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| They have big houses on small lots, big houses on large lots, small houses on big lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9052)|
| 2:30:58| and small houses on small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9058)|
| 2:31:02| You have commercial right in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9062)|
| 2:31:05| That subdivision was developed early in the 20th century| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9065)|
| 2:31:10| and continues to be a magnet for people who want housing close in to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9070)|
| 2:31:18| So the fact that there are differing densities in the neighborhood, I suggest to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9078)|
| 2:31:24| has no effect on quality of life of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9084)|
| 2:31:29| People traveling on Millstone Road, traffic should not increase going west in front of the neighbor's houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9089)|
| 2:31:37| because there's no outlet down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| Anybody leaving this subdivision will go east towards George Williams and Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9099)|
| 2:31:46| Again, I would urge you to adopt the recommendations of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9106)|
| 2:31:53| We would like flexibility on conditions one and two to use conservation easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9113)|
| 2:31:59| rather than lot size to protect the four lots mentioned there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9119)|
| 2:32:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9124)|
| 2:32:09| Councillor Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| Just very briefly, the issue of the boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9132)|
| 2:32:20| the buffering that's been suggested by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| the request for the conservation easement on certain of the exterior lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9143)|
| 2:32:28| is an attempt at an accommodation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9148)|
| 2:32:32| which is certainly appreciated in that it's at least listening to some of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9152)|
| 2:32:38| that the community members are raising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9158)|
| 2:32:40| However, it doesn't go far enough, and in some ways it misses the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9160)|
| 2:32:45| which is this is not just about lot size and sight lines and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9165)|
| 2:32:52| but this is about density and the impact that that density is going to have on property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9172)|
| 2:32:59| on infrastructure, on school overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9179)|
| 2:33:04| I think the estimates are, from MPC at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9184)|
| 2:33:07| that there's going to be 1,970 additional vehicle trips per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9187)|
| 2:33:12| that result from this subdivision along Millstone Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| which, as we've noted, is currently 18 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9195)|
| 2:33:19| and at best, according to county engineering, is going to get to 20 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9199)|
| 2:33:24| which is really not a whole lot better than 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9204)|
| 2:33:27| There's also, according to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| the estimates of 126 additional students yielded into the West Knox County school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9209)|
| 2:33:34| that being AL Lots, West Valley Middle School, and Bearden Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9214)|
| 2:33:38| most of which, as you know, are already overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9218)|
| 2:33:42| And those are some of the other issues that we're concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9222)|
| 2:33:46| So when they talk about, well, let's just buffer and increase sight lines and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9226)|
| 2:33:51| that doesn't address the other issues that are at play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9231)|
| 2:33:55| which is it's a simple numbers game that this is too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9235)|
| 2:34:02| And to that point, even if you accept the idea that there needs to be this buffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9242)|
| 2:34:09| the buffering doesn't go far enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| because the four lots that are on the south side of Millstone Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9251)|
| 2:34:17| to which they suggest there should be buffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| are not the only peripheral lots that are going to be impacted by this proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| If you look at the county maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9265)|
| 2:34:28| there are four or five additional homes that are directly up against this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9268)|
| 2:34:33| that are going to be just as impacted as those four houses along Millstone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9273)|
| 2:34:37| And there's been no effort to buffer those houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9277)|
| 2:34:40| There's been no effort to minimize the impact that this subdivision would have on those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9280)|
| 2:34:45| In fact, the buffering hurts those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9285)|
| 2:34:49| because the developer is going to have to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9289)|
| 2:34:52| for the loss of density in the upper right corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9292)|
| 2:34:55| by shifting that density to the other portions of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9295)|
| 2:34:59| So we hurt one group of folks to try to help another group of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9299)|
| 2:35:05| But the real solution to that is if MPC acknowledges the incompatibility of these zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9305)|
| 2:35:11| and the need to transition from the large lots into a more dense population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9311)|
| 2:35:18| then we need to do that along all the peripheries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9318)|
| 2:35:21| so that we give equal protection to all of the adversely affected lot owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9321)|
| 2:35:26| And there's just not been an effort to do that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9326)|
| 2:35:29| So to the extent we're going to do buffering or something of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9329)|
| 2:35:33| it needs to apply to the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| not just to the two or three homeowners who may have been the loudest to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9336)|
| 2:35:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9340)|
| 2:35:50| Sir, your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9350)|
| 2:35:52| My name is Eddie Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9352)|
| 2:35:54| I live at 825 Frills Lane, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9354)|
| 2:35:59| I'm the owner of the property that's proposed to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9359)|
| 2:36:04| I will maintain ownership of two residences on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9364)|
| 2:36:10| One of them is going to be one of the most expensive houses in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9370)|
| 2:36:15| It's an approximately 8,000-square-foot brick house that will be maintained on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9375)|
| 2:36:20| and it has to have just a little over, just say, an acre and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9380)|
| 2:36:25| because of how it sits back off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9385)|
| 2:36:28| I will also maintain another house with approximately 0.6 to 0.7 acres at 803 Frills Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9388)|
| 2:36:36| which my brother is a resident of and will continue to be a resident of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9396)|
| 2:36:40| I have lived down in this area since approximately 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9400)|
| 2:36:45| I've built these houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| I've sold land to some of the people that have houses in question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9407)|
| 2:36:52| There is a substantial already going to be a buffer between the existing homes and the subdivision as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9412)|
| 2:37:02| My house will actually be closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9422)|
| 2:37:04| or my houses will be closer to the houses that are going to be built by these developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9424)|
| 2:37:09| than anybody else in the entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9429)|
| 2:37:13| These roads have been paved by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9433)|
| 2:37:18| Knox County comes by and mows both sides of the roads every year since I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9438)|
| 2:37:24| Any of you that have been out there, when you come down Millstone Lane past West Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9444)|
| 2:37:30| you have very small lots with houses sitting up near the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9450)|
| 2:37:37| They haven't bothered the value of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| They didn't bother me to build that house down there when I built it or anybody else's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9460)|
| 2:37:46| This is a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9466)|
| 2:37:47| I've seen the type of houses these gentlemen build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9467)|
| 2:37:51| It's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9471)|
| 2:37:52| It's not going to affect anybody's house values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9472)|
| 2:37:57| If it was, it would affect mine, and I've got them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9477)|
| 2:38:02| and I wouldn't do it if it was going to affect my values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| I'd ask for you to approve it and give them leeway to make these green spaces and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9485)|
| 2:38:14| and the roads will be accessible to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9494)|
| 2:38:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9498)|
| 2:38:20| And one last time, Counselor Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9500)|
| 2:38:30| My understanding of the option agreement between Mr. Daniel and Essany Properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9510)|
| 2:38:35| although admittedly I haven't seen it so I can't speak with firsthand knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9515)|
| 2:38:40| but my understanding from the representations that have been made by Mr. Daniel to my clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9520)|
| 2:38:45| is that his house and his brother's house are perhaps included in that option agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9525)|
| 2:38:51| and will be subject to sale upon approval of the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9531)|
| 2:38:55| So if Mr. Daniel is selling his house as part of this agreement, then he's gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9535)|
| 2:39:03| and he doesn't have to suffer the impacts that this would have on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9543)|
| 2:39:08| It's already included within the multimillion-dollar sale price that he's going to receive for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9548)|
| 2:39:13| Now, again, that could be wrong, but that's the information that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9553)|
| 2:39:17| My understanding is that Mr. Daniel intends at some point or another to get the heck out of Dodge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9557)|
| 2:39:23| and will be the ones left with what's left behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9563)|
| 2:39:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9569)|
| 2:39:32| We will now enter into questions from commissioners of the information that has been given to us so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9572)|
| 2:39:41| We may get to you in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9581)|
| 2:39:43| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9583)|
| 2:39:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9586)|
| 2:39:47| You had mentioned at the beginning of the rezoning that if folks from the community wanted to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9587)|
| 2:39:54| do you want them to do that at the same time since the property owners had a chance to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9594)|
| 2:39:59| I think they've got one designated individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9599)|
| 2:40:03| If they want to go ahead and say something before we get into discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9603)|
| 2:40:07| Recognize whoever that is, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9607)|
| 2:40:15| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9615)|
| 2:40:16| I'm Alex Detrana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9616)|
| 2:40:17| I live at 9314 Millstone Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9617)|
| 2:40:21| When my family and I moved into our house five months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| we were excited about the prospect of having beautiful views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| and a measure of solitude while still being in an area that's easily accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9628)|
| 2:40:34| In addition, our 7- and 11-year-old daughters were excited to finally have a road with traffic that's light enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9634)|
| 2:40:41| that they can ride their bikes and walk our dogs without having to worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9641)|
| 2:40:45| But the day we drove down Millstone Road with the moving trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9645)|
| 2:40:49| a sign went up announcing a request to rezone the area surrounding our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9649)|
| 2:40:54| Ever since, we've been living under the specter of having 136 houses surrounding us and our friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9654)|
| 2:41:02| I want to be clear about one thing and reiterate what Mr. Collins said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9662)|
| 2:41:05| We're not anti-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9665)|
| 2:41:08| We're fully supportive of development that's done in an appropriate and responsible manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9668)|
| 2:41:15| In fact, we've reached out to the current owner of the property in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9675)|
| 2:41:18| and offered to help him find another more appropriate development options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9678)|
| 2:41:22| We've also found a list, at least a dozen people deep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9682)|
| 2:41:26| who are interested in buying two- to five-acre lots and building on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9686)|
| 2:41:32| We currently have one neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9692)|
| 2:41:34| We would have no problem having several neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9694)|
| 2:41:37| but having 10 or more neighbors on one-sixth to one-acre lots directly adjacent to our houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9697)|
| 2:41:43| is simply not appropriate for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| In addition, allowing county engineering to change what's required in terms of road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9706)|
| 2:41:51| simply to enable development and taking away some already very small yards that people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9711)|
| 2:41:58| simply because it is possible is not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9718)|
| 2:42:02| And finally, the county and the developers have zero evidence of right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9722)|
| 2:42:06| for a portion of the road improvements that will be necessary to support the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9726)|
| 2:42:11| Forcing landowners to potentially go to court simply to preserve their property rights is shameful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9731)|
| 2:42:18| Thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9738)|
| 2:42:25| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| Oh, is mine still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9747)|
| 2:42:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9748)|
| 2:42:29| I thought you wanted to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9749)|
| 2:42:31| No, I was just going to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9751)|
| 2:42:32| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9752)|
| 2:42:33| Are we going to discuss without?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| We're going to do questions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9755)|
| 2:42:36| Questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9756)|
| 2:42:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9757)|
| 2:42:38| I have a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9758)|
| 2:42:39| One, Mr. Daniel, if you don't mind to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9759)|
| 2:42:42| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9762)|
| 2:42:43| I'm looking at the map on KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9763)|
| 2:42:45| I wish I could project it up for you, but I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9765)|
| 2:42:48| And so the property kind of goes down Frills Lane and kind of jays over, I guess, for lack of a better term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9768)|
| 2:42:55| And looking at where you were talking about, it looks like where your brother currently lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9775)|
| 2:43:01| And I guess is it a blue roof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9781)|
| 2:43:04| It's a blue roof log cabin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9784)|
| 2:43:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9785)|
| 2:43:06| So he's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9786)|
| 2:43:07| And so the property line kind of quits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9787)|
| 2:43:09| But on the other home, I assume next to it is yours, the 925 or 825, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9789)|
| 2:43:14| 825 is where I reside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9794)|
| 2:43:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9796)|
| 2:43:17| There's buildings behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9797)|
| 2:43:18| Well, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9798)|
| 2:43:19| And so will those be removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| I'm trying to figure out where the house is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9804)|
| 2:43:25| Those will be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9805)|
| 2:43:26| It's a 3200 square foot steel building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9806)|
| 2:43:31| And the other is about 72 to 80 feet long and 22 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9811)|
| 2:43:39| It's where it's basically storage for tractor and mowers and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9819)|
| 2:43:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9824)|
| 2:43:45| So you're going to carve out the log cabin on a sixth of an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9825)|
| 2:43:49| which would essentially be the driveway over to the corner of the triangle there, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9829)|
| 2:43:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9835)|
| 2:43:56| And then you're going to have how many acres carved out around your house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| It's about an acre and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| It's not absolutely final, an acre and a half, an acre and a sixth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9842)|
| 2:44:08| And then the rest of the homes will be, I guess, in the rest of that jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9848)|
| 2:44:13| Where's the entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9853)|
| 2:44:15| That may be a better question for Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9855)|
| 2:44:18| My understanding is it's about halfway between the corner of Friel's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9858)|
| 2:44:27| and that property line on Millstone, approximately half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9867)|
| 2:44:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9871)|
| 2:44:32| So halfway between there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9872)|
| 2:44:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9873)|
| 2:44:34| And my next question, Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind, is for Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9874)|
| 2:44:40| Do you want me to stand here just in case somebody else has a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9880)|
| 2:44:43| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9883)|
| 2:44:47| How much road, what's the length of the roadway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9887)|
| 2:44:50| I went out there today and I just kind of, I know the improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| there's a turn lane on this west side of the red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9893)|
| 2:44:57| So what's the improvement distance that you have to make, sidewalk and all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9897)|
| 2:45:01| Do you know the length of that distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9901)|
| 2:45:04| I'm Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9904)|
| 2:45:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9906)|
| 2:45:07| I don't have to give my address or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9907)|
| 2:45:08| But anyway, from where you see the sidewalk stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9908)|
| 2:45:12| back to that first intersection where Friel's is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9912)|
| 2:45:16| I would say about 150 feet beyond there is where our entrance would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9916)|
| 2:45:21| and Knox County Highway Department will work with our engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9921)|
| 2:45:26| and tell us how they want us to construct the sidewalk and fix the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9926)|
| 2:45:31| and that's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9931)|
| 2:45:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9933)|
| 2:45:34| I guess part of my confusion is we're talking about right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9934)|
| 2:45:37| Currently Mr. Daniels owns south of Millstone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9937)|
| 2:45:41| and Knox County owns the other side of Friel's south of Millstone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9941)|
| 2:45:46| because it's a school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9948)|
| 2:45:50| You're saying south of Millstone and north of Millstone, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9950)|
| 2:45:53| No, south of Millstone on one side Mr. Daniels owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9953)|
| 2:45:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9956)|
| 2:45:57| On the other side there's school property access according to KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9957)|
| 2:46:02| Is that no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9962)|
| 2:46:03| No, that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9963)|
| 2:46:04| No, there's a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9964)|
| 2:46:06| Mr. Daniels' property has Friel's Lane and then the Gibson property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9966)|
| 2:46:12| and then the school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9972)|
| 2:46:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9974)|
| 2:46:15| KGIS must be bad then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9975)|
| 2:46:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9976)|
| 2:46:17| There's kind of a triangle piece that goes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9977)|
| 2:46:18| I see that, but I didn't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9978)|
| 2:46:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9980)|
| 2:46:21| So we're talking about a little bit of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9981)|
| 2:46:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9982)|
| 2:46:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9983)|
| 2:46:26| What are the differences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9986)|
| 2:46:27| So we have three surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9987)|
| 2:46:30| I guess this question will go to Mr. Collins if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9990)|
| 2:46:33| There's three surveys, the residents, the developer, and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=9993)|
| 2:46:41| What are the differences in those surveys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10001)|
| 2:46:43| And you say there's no evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| I guess I'm trying to figure out if there's no evidence of right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10005)|
| 2:46:49| how did we sort of survey right-of-way on three accounts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10009)|
| 2:46:52| I guess that's really my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10012)|
| 2:46:54| I don't understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10014)|
| 2:46:58| It's a fairly complicated question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10018)|
| 2:47:00| so I'm going to try to not bore you with a lot of legalese while I answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10020)|
| 2:47:07| The simple answer is that the surveys are nothing more than property line surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10027)|
| 2:47:13| And when we talk about right-of-way, right-of-way is nothing more than an easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10033)|
| 2:47:20| and it has to be given or taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10040)|
| 2:47:23| And so either it's dedicated by a property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10043)|
| 2:47:26| or it's taken by the county through eminent domain condemnation powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10046)|
| 2:47:32| But in either case, it's nothing more than an easement over property that someone owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10052)|
| 2:47:39| And, you know, if the county abandons the right-of-way at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10059)|
| 2:47:43| the ownership goes back to the original landowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10063)|
| 2:47:46| free and clear of the encumbrance of the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10066)|
| 2:47:49| So what the boundary surveys that were produced by the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10069)|
| 2:47:56| and the developer and our surveyors show are the property lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10076)|
| 2:48:03| for some of the properties in the area, that being, most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10083)|
| 2:48:07| the property of Tim Gibson to the south of Millstone Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10087)|
| 2:48:10| and the property of Joan Schwarzenberg to the north of Millstone Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10090)|
| 2:48:14| So the lines that you would see in those surveys are property line surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10094)|
| 2:48:20| And county engineering, from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10100)|
| 2:48:23| is essentially taking the position that everything that's between those two property lines is right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10103)|
| 2:48:31| But there's no instrument anywhere that dedicated that strip of land as right-of-way to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10111)|
| 2:48:39| and there's never been any imminent domain proceedings to condemn that strip of land to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10119)|
| 2:48:48| Even if there was, it would be owned by somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10128)|
| 2:48:52| And so county engineering admits we only maintain 18 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10132)|
| 2:48:58| We don't maintain anything outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10138)|
| 2:49:02| So if there's no document dedicating that strip of land to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10142)|
| 2:49:08| and there's been no imminent domain proceeding brought by the county to condemn that strip of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10148)|
| 2:49:14| then the only thing that the county can really claim is the 18 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10154)|
| 2:49:20| through like an inverse condemnation type claim where they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10160)|
| 2:49:24| you know, we've maintained it for 50 years or so, so it's ours now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10164)|
| 2:49:28| So I would submit to you the surveys show nothing more than the boundary lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10168)|
| 2:49:33| of Tim Gibson's property on the south and the boundary lines of Joan Schwarzenberg's property on the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10173)|
| 2:49:38| The interesting question that nobody has resolved yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10178)|
| 2:49:42| which I anticipate is probably coming sooner rather than later, is who owns the strip in the middle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10182)|
| 2:49:50| But it's not the county because they don't have a document that shows it, and they just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10190)|
| 2:49:57| And so the discrepancies in the surveys, bringing it all full circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10197)|
| 2:50:02| the discrepancies in the surveys I think are largely just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10202)|
| 2:50:07| surveyors use different means to arrive at the conclusions that they make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10207)|
| 2:50:12| and one guy may find a monument that somebody else didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10212)|
| 2:50:15| And so there's some variations in the surveys as far as where the boundary lines are indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10215)|
| 2:50:20| I think just because of different techniques and this, that, and the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10220)|
| 2:50:25| if you don't have your line pointed exactly right, you may end up a little off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10225)|
| 2:50:30| But I completely disagree that anything about our survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10230)|
| 2:50:37| or anything about anyone's survey that's been produced to date shows right of way as that is a legal concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10237)|
| 2:50:47| Okay. I guess Mr. Seymour or Scott, if it's okay to rebut that, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10247)|
| 2:50:54| First of all, I'm not a lawyer obviously, but a public right of way is not an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10254)|
| 2:51:01| It's fee simple property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10261)|
| 2:51:03| When you go into your subdivision, you may see a curb in the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10263)|
| 2:51:08| but most properties don't start at the curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10268)|
| 2:51:11| They start about 12 or 13 feet back if you have a 50-foot right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10271)|
| 2:51:15| And in this case, all three surveys showed the county had fee simple right of way down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10275)|
| 2:51:22| I think even their survey showed 36 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10282)|
| 2:51:27| That's not right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10287)|
| 2:51:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10289)|
| 2:51:30| That was my understanding, and I've seen all the surveys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10290)|
| 2:51:33| and I don't think we'd be here if the three surveys didn't all show that there's a public right of way there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10293)|
| 2:51:40| May I supplement that just a little bit also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10300)|
| 2:51:45| Knox County, for instance, Emory Road, was a road that there, until it was widened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10305)|
| 2:51:54| never had an instrument dedicating it to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10314)|
| 2:51:57| It was an old 18th century, maybe prior to that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10317)|
| 2:52:02| Public use, public maintenance are ways to create roads in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10322)|
| 2:52:10| The county, and I don't know whether you all had any on your agenda today, accepts roads by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10330)|
| 2:52:20| The city of Knoxville accepts roads by plaque dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10340)|
| 2:52:25| But your roads in Knox County, a lot of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10345)|
| 2:52:28| there is no paper document other than the highway map that shows these are public roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10348)|
| 2:52:34| But the county has maintained them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| Property owners recognize there is an area outside their boundaries where there is a public road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10356)|
| 2:52:43| some of which may have existed for 150 or 200 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10363)|
| 2:52:47| So it's up to the engineering department to determine where the public right of way is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10367)|
| 2:52:54| and I think in this case they have determined there is adequate public right of way for the improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10374)|
| 2:53:01| Commissioner Anders, were you continuing on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10381)|
| 2:53:03| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10383)|
| 2:53:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10385)|
| 2:53:07| My question, I guess, I'll start with Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10387)|
| 2:53:16| And, Cindy, just to touch a bit on right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10396)|
| 2:53:24| They're done by ordinance, are they not, dedication of a road size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10404)|
| 2:53:27| and that determines how much right of way that the county takes each time that property changes hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10407)|
| 2:53:35| I'm not sure I totally understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10415)|
| 2:53:38| In terms of the right of way dedication, if there has been a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10418)|
| 2:53:44| there are call outs and whatnot shown on the plat that show where the iron rods are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10424)|
| 2:53:50| and what the distances and bearings are for those points and lines that connect those pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10430)|
| 2:53:57| Is that what you were trying to get to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10437)|
| 2:54:01| So sometimes there can be right of way without a recorded plat reflecting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10441)|
| 2:54:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10447)|
| 2:54:09| And in our case, we have an old card file system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10449)|
| 2:54:15| It's an index file system that we have never thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10455)|
| 2:54:19| And we have an index card that goes back for Millstone Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10459)|
| 2:54:26| It says formerly L.R. Smith, 40-foot right of way off George Williams Road to D.E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10466)|
| 2:54:35| And then it has W.X. McCammon, 10257.38 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10475)|
| 2:54:43| And that's what was in the old card system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10483)|
| 2:54:46| Like I said, we've never gotten rid of the card system because sometimes it helps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10486)|
| 2:54:51| because the KGIS system that you pull up is not necessarily accurate what you see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10491)|
| 2:54:57| not unlike the fact that Mr. Gibson's property doesn't show that there's a 28-foot distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10497)|
| 2:55:04| where the right of way is only 36 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10504)|
| 2:55:08| Is the only place that the right of way is in question is that pie piece that's just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10508)|
| 2:55:13| It's just to the east of Freels Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10513)|
| 2:55:16| And the surveyor for the county said it was 27.99 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10516)|
| 2:55:29| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10529)|
| 2:55:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| Ms. Pianchi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10534)|
| 2:55:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10535)|
| 2:55:37| I was in a meeting with Mr. Snowden and yourself and several of the property owners there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10537)|
| 2:55:43| and they showed you the documentation regarding their right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10543)|
| 2:55:47| and where on maps that they showed there was two strips of land that wasn't part of the county's right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10547)|
| 2:55:55| After that meeting concluded, did you or Mr. Snowden or anybody in engineering go to the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10555)|
| 2:56:04| and say, can you weigh in on this, do we have legal authority, do we have that 40-foot right of way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10564)|
| 2:56:10| I know I did not contact the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10570)|
| 2:56:15| Jim Snowden did not either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10575)|
| 2:56:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10579)|
| 2:56:23| This question is then for Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10583)|
| 2:56:30| What is now going to be the total yardage, excuse me, total acreage of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10590)|
| 2:56:38| when you carve out the two homes for Mr. Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10598)|
| 2:56:45| I'll let Mr. Mosley answer that, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10605)|
| 2:56:52| Eric Mosley, 405 Mountain Brook Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10612)|
| 2:56:57| I want to clarify that right of way issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10617)|
| 2:57:01| The right of way was on a plot that was laid down, I guess, 30 years ago possibly, and it's up record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10621)|
| 2:57:16| As far as the acreage, could you repeat that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10636)|
| 2:57:21| Okay, what now is going to be the total acreage of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10641)|
| 2:57:26| minus the carve out for the two properties for Mr. Daniel's homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10646)|
| 2:57:33| It's going to be approximately, I mean it's not finalized yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10653)|
| 2:57:36| but it's going to be approximately what he had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10656)|
| 2:57:39| possibly an acre and a half or so on the bigger house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10659)|
| 2:57:42| and then maybe half an acre on the smaller house, so 37 and a half possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10662)|
| 2:57:49| Okay, and then are those, I guess the question came up from the other attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10669)|
| 2:57:54| are the two homes part of the sales package for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10674)|
| 2:58:01| That's not really, I mean it's not totally determined yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10681)|
| 2:58:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| I mean it's all part of the package, but there's a possibility that things will stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10691)|
| 2:58:18| that Mr. Daniel's maintain the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10698)|
| 2:58:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10704)|
| 2:58:26| And then I have a question for Mr. Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10706)|
| 2:58:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10710)|
| 2:58:35| Mr. Collins, the subdivision that's platted to the south of the property across the railroad tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10715)|
| 2:58:40| is built out at one and a half dwelling units per acre, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10720)|
| 2:58:46| That's Gary's view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10726)|
| 2:58:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10728)|
| 2:58:49| And it's interesting that the individual that wants to sell the track to the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10729)|
| 2:58:59| wants to carve out an estate size property of one and a half or two acres or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10739)|
| 2:59:05| that he doesn't want to have that the same as what the balance of the development is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10745)|
| 2:59:12| at three dwelling units per acre or so what they're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10752)|
| 2:59:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10757)|
| 2:59:18| I'll defer to anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10758)|
| 2:59:21| And also the state's view subdivision on the other side of George Williams Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10761)|
| 2:59:24| is a similar density of 1.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10764)|
| 2:59:28| So that type of low density is in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10768)|
| 2:59:33| is prevalent particularly for the larger subdivisions that are in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10773)|
| 2:59:38| The smaller subdivisions take on higher densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10778)|
| 2:59:41| The larger subdivisions take on lower densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| This would be one of the larger subdivisions in the area at this 35 to 40 acre size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10784)|
| 2:59:50| So if we talk about the precedent of what's already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10790)|
| 2:59:53| then large subdivisions like this would dictate a lower density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10793)|
| 2:59:59| substantially lower density than those smaller subdivisions that they're relying on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10799)|
| 3:00:04| as the precedent for three, four, five, six, seven dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10804)|
| 3:00:12| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10812)|
| 3:00:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10814)|
| 3:00:15| This is for Mr. Collins, and I just want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10815)|
| 3:00:21| I just need to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| One of your biggest issues is the impact of the housing development on the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10823)|
| 3:00:28| especially the road expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10828)|
| 3:00:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10829)|
| 3:00:30| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10830)|
| 3:00:31| The second one happens to be that further impact in terms of increasing the size of the students attending schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10831)|
| 3:00:39| which would be West Valley and Beard Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10839)|
| 3:00:41| Correct, and that's relying on the MPC estimates for student yield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10841)|
| 3:00:47| that are in the rezoning report that the staff has prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10847)|
| 3:00:50| Okay, and MPC's recommendation for the three conditions were lot sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10850)|
| 3:00:58| the density in terms of your survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| and the acreage of the particular houses that were going to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10860)|
| 3:01:04| Well, the MPC staff recommendations don't address density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10864)|
| 3:01:12| except that MPC's recommendation is for three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10872)|
| 3:01:18| which is compared to the applicant's original request of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10878)|
| 3:01:22| well, they originally requested five, and then they revised it to 3.4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10882)|
| 3:01:26| and then MPC recommended three, which they're now going along with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10886)|
| 3:01:30| But the three conditions that MPC has suggested as part of the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10890)|
| 3:01:36| the first two have to do with buffering some of the peripheral lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10896)|
| 3:01:41| particularly the lots that are along the south side of Millstone Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10901)|
| 3:01:46| buffering those with larger lots, but that won't impact the overall density of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10906)|
| 3:01:53| What they're essentially going to do is say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10913)|
| 3:01:54| okay, you've got to have at least a one-acre lot here or close to a one-acre lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10914)|
| 3:02:00| but the density is going to remain the same for the overall subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10920)|
| 3:02:04| so the impact of that is going to be one acre here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10924)|
| 3:02:07| but then you're going to have to offset that to achieve density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10927)|
| 3:02:10| with a tenth of an acre lot down here or a fifteen hundredths of an acre or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10930)|
| 3:02:16| some substantially smaller lot elsewhere in the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10936)|
| 3:02:20| that's not subject to the boundary conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10940)|
| 3:02:22| But overall, the density would stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10942)|
| 3:02:26| So if we're talking about impacts on the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10946)|
| 3:02:30| the student yield remains the same because the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10950)|
| 3:02:35| the number of houses ultimately doesn't change based off any of those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10955)|
| 3:02:41| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10961)|
| 3:02:42| So let me ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10962)|
| 3:02:43| Because you and the residents proposed additional recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10963)|
| 3:02:49| what would they be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10969)|
| 3:02:50| What would they be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| Well, first, I think that we would suggest to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10973)|
| 3:02:57| that a change in the zoning designation isn't necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10977)|
| 3:03:00| because of the right-of-way issues, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10980)|
| 3:03:03| and they can't build out at over one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10983)|
| 3:03:06| with the right-of-way and improvement issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10986)|
| 3:03:10| So if they can't do that, they might as well keep it at agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10990)|
| 3:03:12| which allows up to one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10992)|
| 3:03:16| If you disagree with us on the right-of-way issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10996)|
| 3:03:19| or say that's not really the appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=10999)|
| 3:03:21| this isn't the appropriate time for that conversation or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11001)|
| 3:03:25| then I think that what you would see us be okay with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11005)|
| 3:03:29| would be something like Getty's View or the State's View subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11009)|
| 3:03:35| which is across from George Williams Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11015)|
| 3:03:38| It's, gosh, I think 90 to 100 acres or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11018)|
| 3:03:41| And those are developed at roughly 1.5 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11021)|
| 3:03:46| which I think is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11026)|
| 3:03:49| given the particular nature of this land down in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11029)|
| 3:03:55| the existing development, the existing sale, the larger lots, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11035)|
| 3:03:59| I think we would ultimately be okay with 1.5 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11039)|
| 3:04:05| but we would still ask for buffering along the peripheral lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11045)|
| 3:04:10| just to protect those lot owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11050)|
| 3:04:12| Because when you talk about density, it's just an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11052)|
| 3:04:15| So if there's still not buffering in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11055)|
| 3:04:19| one-acre lots on the peripheral boundaries or something to that effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11059)|
| 3:04:25| then they could just stick all the density up in one corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11065)|
| 3:04:29| and just leave the rest undeveloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11069)|
| 3:04:31| and you could have a bunch of tenth-of-an-acre lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11071)|
| 3:04:34| and then 35 undeveloped acres that they didn't touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11074)|
| 3:04:38| So you would still need buffering in place, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11078)|
| 3:04:42| to ensure a smooth transition between the peripheral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11082)|
| 3:04:46| or, excuse me, the adjacent large lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11086)|
| 3:04:49| into this more dense subdivision, you know, even at the 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11089)|
| 3:04:57| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11097)|
| 3:04:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11098)|
| 3:05:03| Do you want to address a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11103)|
| 3:05:04| A comment for Commissioner Gill just to clarify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11104)|
| 3:05:09| and maybe Mr. Britton didn't realize what he was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11109)|
| 3:05:12| but Mr. Green, the MPC voted that the density would be up to 3 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11112)|
| 3:05:21| They did not say 3 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11121)|
| 3:05:24| So that is a range from basically 0.5 dwelling units per acre up to 3 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11124)|
