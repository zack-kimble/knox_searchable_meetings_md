| 2:24:46| It was the first year for that, the 2024 plan, and those projects are what we're funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8686)|
| 2:24:52| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| You will notice that in the five-year capital plan, it was about $96.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8693)|
| 2:25:00| This amount takes into account that we plan on getting a bond premium of about $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8700)|
| 2:25:06| and so that's why that amount is more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| So when you get to this item next week, now you have clarification and you can just vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8710)|

| 2:25:20| sit on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8720)|
| 2:25:21| Ultimately, what we'll have to do is you've got to advertise for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8721)|
| 2:25:26| We'll have to have our ratings call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8726)|

| 2:25:34| Interest rates are currently around 4% for this type of bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8738)|

| 2:26:21| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8781)|
| 2:26:26| We have a motion by Schoonmaker, second by Jay, to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8786)|
| 2:26:30| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8790)|
| 2:26:33| Seeing none, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8795)|

| 2:26:47| Development Board of Knox County, of the County of Knox, Tennessee, in exchange for certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8807)|
| 2:26:53| real property located at 0 Wheeler Street and 2325 Wheeler Street, and the execution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8813)|
| 2:27:00| and delivery of a memorandum of understanding in connection with the exchange and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8820)|
| 2:27:05| of said real property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8825)|
| 2:27:09| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8829)|
| 2:27:10| Motion by Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8830)|
| 2:27:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8831)|

| 2:27:18| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8838)|
| 2:27:19| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8839)|
| 2:27:22| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8842)|
| 2:27:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| Since this has basically been on our agenda for nine months now, I thought we'd give the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8848)|
| 2:27:33| opportunity to explain what a good deal this is for Knox County and this partnership with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8853)|
| 2:27:41| Axel Logistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8861)|
| 2:27:42| So I don't know who wants to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8862)|
| 2:27:51| Joe Petrie with Lawlor Wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| I'm the project manager for the Axel Logistics corporate headquarters and then the corporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8873)|
| 2:27:58| expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8878)|
| 2:28:00| And you've supported Axel through the years with two pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8880)|
| 2:28:06| Those incentives are going to produce up to 1,200 jobs in Knox County on Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8886)|
| 2:28:14| And what this does, it's been a pretty complex process to acquire land that is in close proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8894)|
| 2:28:22| to the corporate headquarters for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| So the Bernard Street property is the property that Knox County currently owns, currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8905)|
| 2:28:31| the sheriff's impound center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8911)|
| 2:28:34| And the sheriff has been very gracious to work with us in coordinating a move, thus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8914)|
| 2:28:40| the exchange of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| So ultimately, we're acquiring property that we will exchange and then will be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8922)|
| 2:28:50| for the new impound center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8930)|
| 2:28:52| And then Axel will end up with the old or Wheeler properties affiliated with Axel Logistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8932)|
| 2:28:58| will end up with the Bernard Center property with some improvements by the county to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8938)|
| 2:29:06| to in the exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8946)|
| 2:29:09| And that will supply 400 parking spaces for our larger headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8949)|
| 2:29:14| We're doing everything we can in the community to acquire or lease parking spaces in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8954)|
| 2:29:23| proximity so that we're not overstressing the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8963)|
| 2:29:28| This is about three blocks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| We'll handle security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8970)|
| 2:29:33| City of Knoxville is helping us with lighting and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8973)|
| 2:29:36| So ultimately, it will be a clear path from this area all along Bernard Street to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8976)|
| 2:29:43| headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| And both sites are comparable acreage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8985)|
| 2:29:50| Comparable, but I'm not sure exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8990)|
| 2:29:56| So they're close in acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8996)|
| 2:29:58| They would have different values because of the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| And then Knox County is going to remove the structures on its current property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9002)|
| 2:30:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9006)|
| 2:30:07| And then Axel is going to participate in providing new structures on the new property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9007)|
| 2:30:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9015)|
| 2:30:16| Axel's total commitment is right at $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9016)|
| 2:30:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9021)|
| 2:30:24| And finance is good with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9024)|
| 2:30:28| And Hugh Holt is good with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9031)|
| 2:30:36| Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9036)|
| 2:30:37| Oh, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9040)|
| 2:30:41| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9041)|
| 2:30:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9042)|
| 2:30:43| I just want to say it has been a long time coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9043)|
| 2:30:47| Glad this is finally on our agenda for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| And I want to personally thank you for everything that you do for the community, keeping the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9050)|
| 2:30:55| neighborhoods in mind when planning for expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9055)|
| 2:30:59| And the things you do to give back, including helping with any kind of homelessness that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9059)|
| 2:31:04| in the area and even getting involved in community service outlets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9064)|
| 2:31:08| So I just want to say thank you for being good stewards of District 2, the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9068)|
| 2:31:14| and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9074)|
| 2:31:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9078)|
| 2:31:19| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9079)|
| 2:31:20| Seeing none, this is a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9083)|
| 2:31:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9085)|
| 2:31:26| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9086)|

| 2:31:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9088)|
| 2:31:29| So, before we get to the zonings, Mr. Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9089)|
| 2:31:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9108)|

| 2:31:55| meeting schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| Commissioner Schoonmaker, I believe you wanted to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9118)|
| 2:32:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9121)|
| 2:32:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9122)|
| 2:32:03| The NACO conference this summer would overlap the date of our work session in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9123)|
| 2:32:11| And so I was going to propose that maybe we do like we've done previous months for spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9131)|
| 2:32:17| break and things that we roll and do the work session the fourth Monday and then the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9137)|

| 2:32:26| So those individuals who want to attend the NACO conference would not miss our work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9146)|
| 2:32:32| agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240318?start=9152)|
