| 0:00:35| cycles of life and how cold now will produce flowers and crops in the spring, but it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=35)|

| 0:03:06| For the Mayor's report, first I want to say that it was a great day on Monday to see so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=186)|
| 0:03:13| many people out for the Martin Luther King Jr. Parade and then the service that followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| Despite the frigid weather, 20 some degrees I think, there were a lot of people who were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| there, participated, and the church was full for the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| I know several council members were there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| And the whole week of activities were really special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| So I appreciate first that the Commemorative Commission puts that on each year and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| they always bring in some really great speakers and have a lot of great activities for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| so we can continue to reflect on the life and legacy of Dr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| I want to tell you about one upcoming event for the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| There will be a public meeting about the Magnolia Avenue streetscapes plan at 5.30 p.m. this Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| January 21st at the John T. O'Connor Senior Center, which is at 611 Wynona.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| Staff from our Office of Redevelopment and Engineering Department will be there along with our design consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| to present the final design details for the streetscapes between Jezemian Street and North Bertrand Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=257)|
| 0:04:24| We've had a couple of meetings in the past as we followed through the process from the early concepts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| and now we're bringing back the final design details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| This section between Jezemian and North Bertrand will serve as a template for the streetscapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=273)|
| 0:04:41| which eventually will run the length of Magnolia out to Chilhowee Park and will do so many blocks at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=281)|
| 0:04:48| Some of the planned improvements include raised medians, bike lanes, improved sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| and new street lighting, benches, and bike racks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| So if you want to see what that is all going to look like, we encourage you to come on out to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| again, this Thursday at 5.30 p.m. at the O'Connor Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| And now I would like to invite a few of our friends to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| Dr. Martha Buchanan is here from the Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| and Christy Altman is chair of the Community Health Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| They have recently completed a community health assessment and a community health improvement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| and they are going to talk to us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| Dr. Buchanan, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| And thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| Thank you, Councilman, for allowing us this time to present to you the community health assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| Knox County Health Department looks at lots of data on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| but every few years we really take the 10,000-foot view and really look at the state of the state of health in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=343)|
| 0:05:50| And one of the things you have before you is our community health assessment, which is this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=350)|
| 0:05:57| And what this represents is data that tells us what people are getting sick from and dying from in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=357)|
| 0:06:04| as well as what our citizens think about health and quality of life in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| It really is a combination of all of that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| There's a lot of information there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| This information is not only used by us to guide our strategic planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| but we hope it will also be used by our partners as they apply for grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| or as they make decisions about strategic options on what they want to do in relationship to health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| One of the things that I like about the document that we created this year is it has information on contributing factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=389)|
| 0:06:37| So what are the things that are contributing to this problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| And also, what are the things that are strengths in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| So it really is a very thorough document that I hope you will use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| One of the other uses of this document is for the Community Health Council, which Christy chairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| to take this document, distill it down even further, and come up with a community health improvement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| which Christy is going to share with you, and then we'll both entertain questions if there are any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| Good evening. I'm Christy Altman, and our address is 1407 Dunwoody Boulevard, zip code is 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| And thank you to Dr. Buchanan for leading us off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| and thank you, Mayor and Councilmembers, for having us here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| I am the chair of our Local Community Health Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| We were formed in 2013 by ordinance to serve the city of Knoxville, Knox County, and the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=442)|
| 0:07:30| The health council was born out of an initiative called Together Healthy Knox that some of you may remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| This began in 2010, and we did a process of looking through the assessments from the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| and then honing in on three issues that we worked towards for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| And this comes around every three to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| We reassess, look at new initiatives, and come up with new things to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| So out of this year's Knox County Health Department, where they did the health assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| we've come up with our community health improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| So that's another document that you should have in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| And this just came off the presses last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| It's new to the public, and we're just making the rounds, telling everyone a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| But what we did is we took the health assessment, and we took 20 of the top priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| We had a retreat in June, and our health council members brought this down to three initial issues that we wanted to focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=494)|
| 0:08:22| And those were to decrease opioid abuse, to decrease tobacco use with pregnant women and teens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| and increase access to mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| At the end of August, we met with the local hospitals, all the top officials from local hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| and they were approving of those three issues and were very adamant that we add to that list access to mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| So you'll see that in your booklet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| It's got very measurable objectives that we're going to be looking at over the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| And our next steps, what we're doing today is just giving you the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| Over the next several weeks, we're going to be forming action teams to do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| and to meet these objectives that you see in the booklet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| And then we hope to come back in a few months and be able to report back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| as we have information coming in from those work groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| So right now, the next step would be to form those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| and then we'll come back with more information in a few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| and then hopefully at least once a year be able to provide a report to this group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| to county commission, and the town of Farragut on where we stand on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| So this is the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| Of taking this data, you've come up with some priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| and then you'll start working on how we actually address those priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| And we're going to take a couple of, for opioid abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| there's a work group that's already doing some of the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| and so they've agreed to take a look at the objectives and carry forward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| There's a group called Smoke-Free Knoxville that you may be familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| and they've agreed to carry on the work of the tobacco objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| And then we're working to pull together groups for access to greenways, parks, and sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| as well as for the mental health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Councilman Dallibopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Yeah, quick question for Ms. Altman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| When you talk about tobacco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| do you deal with the vaping craze that's going on in the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| that seems to be the substitute thing people are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| and you kind of wonder are they just finding a new way to ruin their health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| The short answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| We hope that the Smoke-Free Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| and the Smoke-Free Knoxville is already taking on the issue of vaping and e-cigarettes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| so we hope they will continue those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| We know that vaping is a gateway into cigarette and other drug use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| since it's nicotine, just in a different format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| How about monster beverages and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Do you look at those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| I go to a convenient mart sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| and people take an armful of that stuff and put it in their car or truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| and I guess drink it all day, but that kind of blows my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| It seems like they're flying on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| Certainly those sugary beverages are one of the contributors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| to our obesity problem here in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| I can say to that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| we are going to work with the United Way of Greater Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| We had a great meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| They're coming up on their next round of health funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| and they have agreed to take these four priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| and integrate that into their next round of funding that will come up this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| So one of the things within that, the indicators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| is just overall healthy lifestyles and educating people on foods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| and better choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| I was curious on the decrease in tobacco use among youth and pregnant women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| It's obvious from 2006 there was quite a drop to 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| but it's starting to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| Is there a reason for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Do they know yet why that's happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| Can you tell me what page you're on, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| Page 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| I was just curious in terms of smoking with pregnant women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| You know, this is data from the self-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| No, we don't have a good explanation for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| It's unfortunate that that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| This is data from birth certificates, so it's not just self-reported data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| So it is women who say they were smoking during pregnancy at delivery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| So it's something for us to keep our eye on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| And one of those things we wanted to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| smoking during pregnancy contributes to a host of poor pregnancy outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| and so it really addresses the health of the child as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Yes, I want to ask you about on the page youth violence, page 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=752)|
| 0:12:39| Can you speak more into the microphone, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| Page 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| Page 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| On the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| I meant the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| This one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Youth violence, and since we're having such a problem with that right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| did you all, I don't want to put you on the spot with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| but come up with any possible solutions to some of the youth violence that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| we are seeing that's going on now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| We did not, but we all noted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| One of the things we talked about is in addressing some of the other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| that we chose to address, access to mental health care, opiate addiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| and exercise, getting out and being active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| Those things are known to impact behavior in youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| and so it is something that we're aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| We couldn't possibly focus on everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| so we chose the four topics that we chose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| but it is something there, and we did feel like some of the things we'll be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| will be addressing some of the behavioral issues as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Yes, and Mr. Rant, on that as well, the United Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| one of their indicators has been for the last round of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| and will be again in this next round of funding addressing violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| domestic violence, violence in youth, and so it's in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| and there are some programs that are already working towards that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| and I'm sure that we'll have more folks apply for that money moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| in the next several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| Thanks for your good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| And now, Council, the final thing is tonight is the last council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| for Thomas Tank Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| You all know that he is retiring at the end of the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| and he has worked for the city for almost two decades under four mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| and I just want to take this opportunity for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| Now, we will be having a retirement reception for him January 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| Friday the 29th at 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| 2.30, 2.30, and I do hope you'll all join us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| but I just want to take this opportunity to thank Tank for his service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| in my administration and for all the mayors before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=895)|
| 0:15:12| Tank, do you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| I wasn't expecting to say anything, but it truly has been a good run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| I've enjoyed it, but I won't be too far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=924)|
| 0:15:31| On those cold and weary mornings, I will call each and every one of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| ask you what are you doing, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| And on those every other Tuesday nights, you'll be sitting back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| not watching us on TV, I presume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| 9.30, I think the people on the Cabinet know what I'm talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=949)|
| 0:15:57| time of the meeting to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| Oh, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| You can send us in your projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Well, Tank, thank you so much, and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Council hope to see you at the retirement reception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| But also with us tonight is the person who will be attempting to fill those shoes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| Avis Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| We sent out the announcement today that Avis Reed, stand up, Avis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| As you all know her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| she's the Executive Director of our Police Advisory Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| and so she will be taking over the responsibilities of the Senior Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| of Community Relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| So, Avis, you're already part of the city, but welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| She's moving up a floor and will be in the Mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| taking over Tank's office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| But we welcome you and look forward to working with you in this new role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| And you get to go to those meetings that Tank's complaining about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| So, Council, that's the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Did you want to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| I just want to say that we had some scouts slip in while you were starting your reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| and maybe you could introduce them or have them introduce themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| Is this a group of scouts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Please come and identify yourself for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| I'm Bob Weissmuller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| My address is 304 Oak Park Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| I am here with Troop 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| and we are here as part of working on the second class requirement for these scouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| where they have to go to a meeting where there are opposing views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| Somehow we got the message that the meeting started at 7, and so we came in late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| We're glad to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| As one of the mayors that I was able to work with Tank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| and I want to say he did an excellent and outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| And before I went in the mayor's office, I did not really know what all he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| But once I went in the mayor's office, I saw that he did quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| So I personally want to thank him for all the great work that he did for this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Yeah, I would like to follow up on that because Tank took on another role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| not connected to the city but as chair of the county commission at a really tough moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1097)|
| 0:18:24| and did an incredible job of herding some wild cats, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| But he did an incredible job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| and I thoroughly enjoyed working with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| And thank the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| We're going to miss you, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1117)|

| 0:20:54| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| This is something that I've been working on for several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| and back in the summer we had an opportunity to hear a presentation from the transportation secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1261)|
| 0:21:09| that came and spoke this summer about the potential shortfall they're going to have in years to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1269)|
| 0:21:16| if some permanent funding solution is not going to be, it can be found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| So I know it's not going to be on, will be voted on this session in the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| but it is something that's going to be brought up hopefully next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| It's imperative to continue the development in Knoxville to have a permanent solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| so road projects are funded, and we've talked a lot about it this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| We had the national secretary of transportation down here and talked about Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| These are projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| We've talked about East Town Mall and the exits there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| There's a lot of projects that are coming that are slated that I'm fearful that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| and many people are fearful that the economic development will slow down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| if there is no permanent solution found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| So this is something we've been talking about for months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| and it's something that may not be heard this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| but I think it is something that we need to have on the radar and continue to keep it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| So I'd like to hopefully be supported tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| and I'd like to hopefully be supported that this will lead to other councils across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| and working with the chamber to see if we can continue to gather support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| for a long-term permanent solution for road funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Well, I appreciate this resolution and the spirit and the intent of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| I don't think that politically this is a good year for us to be sending this to the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| They have made it very clear that they will not entertain transportation issues this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| The governor is not going to be submitting any legislation to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| and I think that this would be a resolution that would be better sent next legislative session in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1374)|
| 0:23:04| I think that there could be political repercussions for municipalities, this one and others who do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1384)|
| 0:23:13| This is a legislature that is intent on a specific agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| and while they say yes, transportation is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| and the governor spent a great deal of time going around to cities all over the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| I don't think that the heart is there in the legislature to do anything about this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1407)|
| 0:23:35| So I think that this resolution, while the spirit is good and I appreciate Councilman Wallace stepping up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| I don't think it's a good idea right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1432)|

| 0:23:55| Abstained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| And one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| So it passes 7-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1437)|

| 0:24:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1478)|

| 0:24:40| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| And I want to recognize Ms. Barbara Kelly out there for the great work that you all do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| and we appreciate the continued partnership here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| And Linda Russ, thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| I just want to say that, you know, several times we've had folks come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| Oh, and KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| There you are, Art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Come before us and maybe think that we're not doing enough for homelessness and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| And I just want to point out that here's another example of what the city is doing in terms of doing our fair share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Also, Mike Gunthorne is out there from Homeless, from our Office of Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| This is a great partnership between KCDCAC and the city funds and programs, so we do appreciate what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1520)|
| 0:25:27| I think you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| We need to make sure that all of our programs are known out there because this is the prevention piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| This is the part that keeps people from ever becoming homeless by having case management in the KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| and some of their high rises, so this is a critical piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| If people are never homeless, then we don't have to address the issue of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| Let's keep them housed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1549)|

| 0:26:20| of a slope easement and a temporary construction easement within certain real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| located at 119 South Castle Street as part of the South Castle Street Sidewalk Improvements Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1584)|
| 0:26:32| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1592)|

| 0:26:34| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| As long as we have Jim Hagerman here, we've got about a half dozen of these easement acquisitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| I guess for situations where the property owner wasn't willing to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| and just do it by agreement and so we're authorizing its acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| Maybe Jim could tell us a little bit about the South Castle Street Sidewalk Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| which these are all related to, and just give us a feel for the project and where it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| I'm Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| The South Castle Street Sidewalk follows South Castle Street from Martin Luther King Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1630)|
| 0:27:25| What's the other terminus there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| Wilson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Down to Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| There are several short pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| Filling in the gaps kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Yeah, but there's more gap than there is sidewalk, so it's sort of beyond filling in gaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| but there is at least something to work with there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| But it's next to the high school, or close to the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| I think there's a middle school close by, and on Wilson there's a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| Will this get you basically from Magnolia to the high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| Is that the idea, or at least part of the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| Students walking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| It gets you from the high school into the neighborhood and to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| You're going to have that done this coming winter, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| Well, the fall of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| I can't be very specific about time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| The right-of-way acquisition has been hanging it up for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1703)|
| 0:28:31| I need to go pin somebody down on time frame before I can commit to anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| but this is usually the last big step before construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| Getting those holdout pieces so you can start doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Yes, I wanted to tell Councilman Della Vopia to give you a little update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| I was contacted in 2010 by a constituent who lives on Castle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| and she was very concerned about students walking along Castle with no sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| A lot of traffic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| A lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| I was on Castle Street today and saw someone walking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| so we've been working on it for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| and it's really going to be an enhancement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| thinking about the Magnolia streetscapes project with just a few streets over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| So it's going to really help the whole neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| but primarily it's going to be a safety issue for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| and others who walk along that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1769)|

| 0:31:21| on the Family Justice Center model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| and to establish a statewide Family Justice Center network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Yeah, if we could ask the chief to maybe tell us about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| Does this fit in with the current efforts to sort of control violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| or is it just a general program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| How does this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| It's a statewide initiative from the governor, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| and so we have been participating in this for a while, the past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| We have a coordinator that's assigned at the FJC that oversees the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1911)|
| 0:32:00| that step forward and want an FJC in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| We opened three last year throughout the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| and so this is just a continuation of that effort to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| This is reaching that effort down into the neighborhoods themselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| Yeah, so what it does is it's a coordination effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| So Family Justice Centers have different looks in different communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| but the idea is to be a one-stop shop for victims of violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| for them to be able to go to one location, get the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| and the protection that they need, and so that's the concept of the FJC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| It's about spreading it to other cities, using our model to take it to other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1955)|
| 0:32:43| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=1963)|

| 0:34:00| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| Council, if there's not an objection, I'd like to ask Peter Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| our Director of Plans Review and Inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| to come down and just give a little overview, background to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| That's probably what you were going to ask, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| That's what I was going to ask, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Just to kind of, I think you all are very familiar with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| but for the public and just give you some explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| and then obviously answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| And this and the next six are all related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Over the past decade or so, our operational costs and expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| have continued to rise with inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| Our services to the contracting community have increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| There's a lot more benefit to working with our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| So we thought it would be an appropriate time to evaluate our fee structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| and how we compare with our regional neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| Research shows that we're lower than our regional neighbors by about 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| So we're proposing a nominal increase across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| with the goal to reduce our supplements from the operational budget down to about 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| Right now we're at about 25% to 28%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| We have provided the information that you received in your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| to the professional organizations regionally, as well as we've held a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| And the feedback that we've received has all been positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| Actually, we've had several indicate that the fees would still be too low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| I think it would be appropriate for us to re-evaluate on a more timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| The last time we evaluated was 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| So I would anticipate we evaluate on a more regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Yeah, just a quick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| It sounds like you may have answered it already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| but do you see any impact on building permit and review applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| or is the fee system more or less so nominal that it's not going to impact opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| or desire to build in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| I don't foresee an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| The best information that we get is from our permit technicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| who deal with the contractors on the front line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| and they've indicated that when contractors come to work with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| they're amazed at the fees and how low they are compared to our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| So I don't really expect a negative impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| We're still below a lot of our neighbors, even with the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| And you're just trying to cover the cost of doing business, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| in terms of evaluating things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| and I suppose giving them positive feedback on things they need to know to build here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| I just wanted to say as a professional in working with the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| the types of services that are given by the city are really at a high level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2214)|
| 0:37:02| And I think that, in fact, I've talked to Peter before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| that maybe they ought to be a little bit higher than what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| But as he said, they're doing this one step at a time as we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| And I know there's some concern that Knox County is less than the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| but I think if you look at what the city provides for not only the contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| but also for the architects, our early preview meetings and this sort of thing that are done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| which really totally help the whole profession on a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| And I think that we have a very professional staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| and they provide very good services to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| And I personally really appreciate that, and thank you, Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2259)|

| 0:39:58| extra exercise of coming down again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| He appreciates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| How do these work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| I mean, we have all these different codes that deal with a specific subject matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| whether it's mechanical systems or plumbing or electrical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| Are there separate reviews with separate fees for each one or is there a package deal when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| you bring in your project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| There are separate reviews and separate fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| For instance, if you're coming in and you're going to build a house, you'll get a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| permit for your structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| You'll get an electrical permit, a plumbing permit, and then a gas mechanical permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| Everything that has an inspection has the permit process with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160119?start=2436)|
