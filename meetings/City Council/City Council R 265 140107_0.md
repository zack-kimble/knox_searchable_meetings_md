| 0:02:35| For the mayor's report, again, I want to wish everybody a happy new year and hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| everybody managed to stay warm the last few days, that you had a great holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| I know we had a record, we had a really good season downtown with our Christmas in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| city events and our New Year's event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| And so I want to say a very special thank you to our city workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| They, when many of us were celebrating the holidays, they were working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| And also, these last few days, when most of us, I hope, were warm in our houses, they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| been out working as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| That includes our uniformed officers, both in the police department and the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| And, of course, our public service workers who have been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| They have barely gotten a break the last several days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| They were out plowing and salting the roads late last week and then back again Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| pre-treating the roads to prevent icing on Sunday and Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| And I know different shifts came in and I've talked to David Brace several times about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| talked to our chiefs, too, to see how our city employees are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| And I think they're all doing pretty well now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| I want to ask Chief Sharp to talk about Captain Lacey here in a second, give us the latest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| But I also want you all to know that public service crews spread 350 tons of salt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| more than 28,000 gallons of brine, and 1,500 gallons of calcium chloride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| And as a result, we've actually had very few problems with the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| It's not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Some of those streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Applause from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| Let's give them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Let's give our employees a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| They made a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| They did make a difference, and we appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| And we've got good plans in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| You've got to have your plans in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| And they have them, and then they execute them really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| So, Chief Sharp, would you please update us on Captain Lacey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| Mark is still in UT's cardiovascular ICU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=272)|
| 0:04:39| For those who don't know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| Yeah, one week ago tonight, Mark was on the scene of a house fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| and they were doing an interior tech, and they came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| And shortly after they came out, he just collapsed on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| And he went into cardiac arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| Fortunately, we had an ambulance on the scene, we had several paramedics on the scene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| and they were able to start working him immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| They regained his pulse, got him to UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| He is, like I said, currently in their cardiovascular ICU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| He is on a ventilator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| He is making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| They do believe that there is no long-term neurological damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| They just have to be able to wean him off the ventilator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| That's the next crucial step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| But the fire department and the city employees and the city as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| has shown a great deal of support for us and for the family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| and they are very appreciative of all the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| and the prayers that have gone up for Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| So if you would just please continue to pray for his full recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| Our heart goes out to him and to his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| His family has been right there, his wife and his kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| And to happen at this time of year, too, with the holidays just upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| We'll continue to look for those updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| Also, I do want to make sure everybody remembers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=372)|

| 0:07:55| And then it goes up to Greater Warner Tabernacle in Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| And then there is a tribute service, an annual service there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| So we encourage everyone who can to get out and to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| to continue to celebrate the vision, the accomplishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| and really it's all about the future and what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| and building on Dr. King's legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| So I encourage everyone to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| I know a lot of us will be participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| Also, let me tell you, last week, or last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| I failed to recognize a new staff person and to acknowledge promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| So I'll start first with the promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| As you all know, we lost Angela Stark, and we miss her a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| She was a great person on our team and in my cabinet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| But when she left to move to Orlando with her family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| Jesse Mayshark was promoted to director of communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| and we appreciate him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| He's been with us two years and done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| And then to fill his role as communications manager, we hired Eric Reland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| I guess I think they were down with counsel at your pre-meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| And so just for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| we want to publicly recognize Eric as a new member of our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| He's hit the ground running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| He's already written on how many press releases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| and how many talking points for me for events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| And he's really fitting in great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| So we're really excited, Eric, to have you with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| And that's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| Counsel reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| Okay, we'll move on then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| 9A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| zoning regulations, Articles 2, 4, and 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| regarding definitions and development standards for small breweries, wineries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| and distilleries in certain commercial and industrial zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Councilman Dellavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| And I do have one person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| Before we do 9A, could maybe Mark Donaldson tell us how 9B is changing 9As| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| and the context of this whole discussion that we're about to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| 9B amends two of the exhibits from 9A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| resulting from some late arriving information about some desires as far as potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| craft breweries, and it caused us to relook at the threshold under which we would keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=617)|
| 0:10:27| the production area within a craft brewery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| And we have recommended that we raise that from 10,000 square feet to 15,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| We found plenty of support for both of those numbers in the scan across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=637)|
| 0:10:44| and both are legitimate and we have no problem with the increase in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=644)|
| 0:10:51| In doing that, we added a couple of provisions as far as spacing of craft facilities that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=651)|
| 0:10:59| adjacent to residential areas and greater than 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| And then we also added in some flexibility as far as the provisions of adaptive reuse of existing buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=664)|
| 0:11:14| and loading areas to give them the flexibility to use existing buildings without significant alterations to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=674)|
| 0:11:25| Mark, if I could ask one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| This issue that's been raised both at MPC and at council as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| or not C1 might be excluded from having, if not craft breweries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| and certainly brew pubs in neighborhood residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| Have you looked at neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Have you looked at that separately at MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| And what did you find?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| The recommendation is not to allow craft breweries in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| By craft, I meant brew pubs, the smaller entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| And what we're doing here is basically codifying an existing practice to allow brew pubs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| as an accessory used to a type of eating and drinking establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| And with the C1, you already are required to have a use-on-review approval for any eating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=732)|
| 0:12:22| and drinking establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| Frankly, I think the interjection of a pub into a neighborhood is a pretty good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| That's my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| So the recommendation is as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| You're leaving it in C1 as well as all the other C categories and the industrial categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Well, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Mark, I had a question about in terms of the size, though, in the C1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| you're going to allow up to 15,000 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| Fifteen thousand square feet is the threshold beyond which a craft brewery cannot go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| with its production facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| The brew pub, the definition of the brew pub is such that the production facilities have to be accessory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| to the eating and drinking establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| So the production facilities have to be less than half of the square footage of any eating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| and drinking establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| We've put a provision in the general definition that that can go up to 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| To do that, you would have to have a 10,000 square foot restaurant or bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| That is very unlikely in the C1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| It could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| But it would be subject to use-on-review approval by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=814)|
| 0:13:42| Do you want to speak now or after this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| No, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| I guess I'll go back to that because in the strategy it says under the brew pub that the drinking establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| will keep the production facilities smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| So you're saying it's half the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| What it says is smaller than the eating and drinking portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| So it just says smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| It doesn't say half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| That's already part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Accessory use, by definition, has to be secondary and incidental to the primary or principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=849)|
| 0:14:18| And the most common metric for making that determination is the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| So in order to be incidental to principal use, it would have to be less than half of the total area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=866)|
| 0:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| Or is that subjective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| I guess that's what – I mean, I don't – anyway, if that's clear and definitive, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| With the use-on-review process, we would have a plan in front of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| They could see the relationships of the production facilities to everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| and make the determination that that is incidental to and accessory to the principal use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=898)|
| 0:15:06| as an eating and drinking establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Because many of the ones – a couple of ones that I'm familiar with, I guess, are pretty –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| eating restaurants in a C-1 that got there by use-on-review are pretty small in nature already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Are the ones I'm familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Well, I want to ask you about the brew pubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Do we have many existing brew pubs already in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| We do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| What are some examples of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Downtown Bar and Grill on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| Calhoun's runs a couple of their restaurants as brew pubs where they brew beer on-site for on-site consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=943)|
| 0:15:54| Black Horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Yeah, Black Horse along Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Mark, I just want to be sure just with what George was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| When you say smaller, that there is some place in here that says that it's half the size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| The definition of an accessory use is that it has to be incidental to and secondary to a principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=973)|
| 0:16:20| The common metric or the first metric that people look at when making that determination is the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| If you had, for example, a facility that was 2,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| and 1,500 square feet of it was the production facility for a brew pub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| that would not be incidental to the entire operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| But if it were 500 feet of 2,000 feet, it could be determined that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| My private counselor here clarified that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| Thanks, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| And now former Councilwoman Carlene Malone is here to speak against this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| Members of Council, warm greetings on a very cold night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| I'm here on behalf of the Community Forum, which is an organization of community organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1035)|
| 0:17:24| First of all, I'm going to read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| We are asking that brew pubs as a use on review be taken out of the C1 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| neighborhood commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| That's the only change we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| Furthermore, be aware of the fact that if you make that change, if you make that amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| it does not have to go back to MPC, in our opinion, because we brought this issue directly to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| So I think you could make that amendment and approve the rest of the ordinance and have it done tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| This is the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Listening to these discussions, we don't know of any brew pub in any C1 at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1075)|
| 0:18:04| We know of none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Taking brew pubs out of C1 would continue to allow restaurants, including the sale of beer and liquor, in the C1 zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1086)|
| 0:18:16| We're not trying to shut down restaurants or end drinking in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| And it would allow brew pubs in all of the commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| That includes C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, planned commercial 1, planned commercial 2, shopping center 1, 2, and 3, and town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1102)|
| 0:18:31| Is that not enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| Be aware of the fact that where our C1s are located in Knoxville, they are in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| They are not on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| They are not on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| They are not on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| They are not on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| They are on streets like Jacksboro Pike, a two-lane road with a failed intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| And that C1 backs on to the homes of Adair Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| They are on Washington Pike, another two-lane road near North Hills, and they are in the middle of Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| They are on Washington Pike at Whittle Springs in the area around Bill Morris School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| But the school is more than the 300 feet required building-to-building to not allow a permit, so a brew pub could go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1151)|
| 0:19:21| There is a general description of the neighborhood commercial district, and that description says this, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| the district is established to provide areas in which the principal use of the land is devoted to the neighborhood store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| It's a restricted commercial district, limited to a narrow range of retail, service, and convenience goods only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1172)|
| 0:19:40| And to the first floor of the structure, the district is designed for areas where large commercial operations are undesirable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| but where individual propriety stores are useful and desirable to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| And it furthermore goes on to say if you have a laundromat, that laundromat is limited to gross 4,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| gross area of 4,000 square feet, and furthermore goes on and says you can't get a variance to make that larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| I think we get the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| These are small, small areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| Regarding accessory use, you can have up to 5,000 of brew space alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| which according to Mr. Donaldson's calculation would mean then a 15,000 square foot facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| Accessory is subordinate, incidental, and so on to the main use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| So at the very least, the restaurant would have to be 6,000 square feet to take on the 5,000 square feet brew space allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1223)|
| 0:20:33| The general description of the neighborhood commercial district in the one-year plan says that it is to serve an area within a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1233)|
| 0:20:42| one-half mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Again, we don't think that's a brew pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| Be aware of the fact also that there are no standards set out in the proposed ordinance for the brew pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| The building could, in fact, be 20 feet from the property line of a residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| Also be aware of the fact that in St. Paul, Minnesota, a similar zone called B1 Local Business District does not allow restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1256)|
| 0:21:04| only takeout delis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| And in Nashville, the CN Commercial Neighborhood District, also a similar district to the C1 in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1266)|
| 0:21:14| limits the size of a full-service restaurant total to gross square footage of 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| Again, we're talking 10 and 15 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| Mrs. Malone, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| We ask that you take brew pubs out of C1, approve the remainder of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| and if you think brew pubs should be included in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| come back and amend the ordinance after looking at the location of brew pubs in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| and how they presently function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Thank you, Mrs. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| Would you also like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| I think you just got in, so you didn't have a chance to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| But we will hear from Mr. Edmund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| Let me get my timer started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Thank you, members of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| Address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| My name is Len Redmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Lane in the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| What we talked about two weeks ago is still not a good idea, so we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| One thing I want to talk about very quickly is the idea of use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| This is the layer of protection that we give over the location of these brew pubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| And let's talk about use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| I attended a meeting last year with a number of other citizens on courtyard development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| MPC hosted this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| There were members of MPC present, many neighborhood groups across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| Everything went fine until someone asked a very simple question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| and we were talking about use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| They said, can you name something that has ever been turned down on a use on review that MPC has actually turned down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1367)|
| 0:22:59| The chairwoman of MPC was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| She could not think of one in all of her years of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| Another member of MPC was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| He could not think of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| The executive director was hosting the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| He could not think of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| So the saddest thing at MPC is to watch a bunch of little old guys and little old ladies come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| and they've got some concerns about a rezoning, and you say, don't worry, we've got use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| Well, if we've never turned one down, and I've been not a constant attendee at MPC meetings for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| but I can't think of one that was ever turned down at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| So I think we're playing an ugly game with innocent citizens here by talking about the layer of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| It's simply not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| We ask that you leave this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| If the economy of this town starts to collapse without brew pubs in C1, we can come back and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1429)|
| 0:23:57| But in the meantime, let's try them in this multitude of other zones that we're approving tonight without any objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1437)|
| 0:24:04| and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| Councilman Dallavopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| I'd like to move to amend the original proposal, if that's in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| and I'll ask Mr. Swanson and Mr. Frost if I can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| to delete C1 from the categories that would allow brew pubs for the present time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| with the understanding that we'll have some experience under our belts and can revisit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| obviously from what Mr. Donaldson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| Even if you have just a pub in the neighborhood, you can bring in the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| And if you have multiple facilities, you can even brew it somewhere else and bring it in as part of your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| So if it's appropriate, I'd like to move that we amend it to delete C1 as one of the categories that brew pubs be allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1488)|
| 0:24:56| or do I have to move to first approve it and then move to amend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| And I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| We already have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| So this is a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Motion to amend to delete brew pubs in C1 areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| We just have to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| I mean, we understand the intent of your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| and we could go back and change the language as necessary to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| That is an appropriate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| And we have a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Seconded that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| And I'm in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| I'm in favor of taking it out to C1, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| I mean, Mr. Donaldson, right now, if you wanted to open a restaurant with a bar in C1, are you able to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1540)|
| 0:25:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| You can open a brew pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| So if you vote for this amendment, should we also not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| I mean, if you think that bars shouldn't be in C1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| I just don't see the difference between a restaurant and a bar and then a restaurant that makes their own beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1562)|
| 0:26:10| Ms. Malone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| First of all, the difference is the size, for one thing, and I think the attractiveness and the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1573)|
| 0:26:21| No brew pub is there for, you know, a half-mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| And the size is the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| But the other thing is be aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| If brew pub is taken out of C1, it cannot be an accessory to a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1589)|
| 0:26:37| because that now would be defined evermore as a brew pub, which is not a permitted use in the C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| So, in other words, it can't come in as an accessory use to a restaurant that would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| Restaurants could still be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| They get use on review approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| But the size would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| And we think the catchment area served by it and the traffic would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| But the restaurant would still be able to serve beer, wine, liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| Absolutely, as they presently do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| So I just don't see, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| I just don't see the huge difference between an establishment that brews its own beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| versus a restaurant that's going to sell beer, wine, and liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| And the brew pubs that I've gone to in the city, Calhoun's and Black Horse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| I don't see those as some type of nefarious place where people go and get, you know, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1642)|
| 0:27:31| Twizzled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Twizzled any more than they would at any other restaurant that has a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| And so I certainly, you know, have tremendous amount of respect for the speakers tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| and my colleagues, but I can't support the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| Let me just say that we don't see this as a nefarious thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| We see it as a size and a traffic thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| You would not put Calhoun's on a two-lane road at a failed intersection on Jacksboro Bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| That's the only difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Thank you, Ms. Millon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Mark, did you want to respond to something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| I was looking at your expressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| Was there any clarification you wanted to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| Councilman Starr is on a good track here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| There is a growing market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| That may be the first time we've heard that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| There is a growing market for locally brewed craft beers, and it is rapidly growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| And if we were to permit a neighborhood restaurant, we would want it to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| And it seems to me that denying it the ability to craft its own beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| may indeed hamper its ability to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| And frankly, to limit an eating and drinking establishment in the C1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1729)|
| 0:28:57| to the major brand beers and not allow it to use the locally brewed beers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1737)|
| 0:29:05| seems a little ridiculous to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| The provision is up to 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| It's going to be related to the size of the overall establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| which is going to be related to the size of the zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| which is going to be related to the catchment area of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| And the likelihood of a brew pub being built in a C1 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1764)|
| 0:29:36| that is on the order of 10,000 square feet is not likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1776)|
| 0:29:44| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Do you have more, Councilman Gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Well, Mark, first of all, it seems to me there's enough confusion over this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| as far as being able to proceed with the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| and going ahead and eliminating it out of C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| But it seems to me that we're not stopping the restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| I think it seems from what I've heard from constituents is the concern is the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| And you're saying, well, it's not likely that one might be 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| but we don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Well, frankly, the size of most C1 zone districts is an acre, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| and the primary use in the C1 zone district is a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| Personally, I'd like to flip it so that a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| a drinking establishment was a use by right, and a gas station was a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| but right now that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| These are neighborhood-serving establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| and why tie the hands of somebody who's going to try to make a go in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| by limiting the type of products that can be served there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1849)|
| 0:30:58| You were saying that they wouldn't be able to serve local products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| They'd still be able to serve local products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| They just don't make their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| They can still get other products in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| So you're just denying them the ability to brew their own beer or wine or distillery drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1868)|
| 0:31:19| Is there a way that you can take this and change the size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| I mean, what seems to be the concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| Can you reduce the size of what's going to be allowed in a city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| Well, with all due respect, the use on review process does work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| and we do occasionally turn them down, but we turn down most of them at the staff level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1894)|
| 0:31:41| They don't get to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| By the time they get to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| most of the details and the issues have been worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| so there is a high percentage of them being approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| But they go through a review to determine whether that's an appropriate scale operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| in that particular zone district in that particular spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| And the idea that we would place a 10,000-square-foot restaurant with a brewing facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1926)|
| 0:32:16| in a location that doesn't support it, the fact that MPC approves most uses on review that get to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1936)|
| 0:32:26| means that there is very little opposition that occurs to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1946)|
| 0:32:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Again, I don't think we're foreclosing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| I think what we're doing is saying, for the time being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| let's pass what seems to be a very good amendment and change to our ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| and simply leave out the brewpub, and if six months or a year from now we think, you know, let it rip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| we can always add it back, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| We can have an amendment to this that's not sealed for all time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| And when you mentioned before the likelihood that that happens is diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| Well, you said there was this one guy that had this burning desire to brew some beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| and I just thought maybe he'd come and urge us to put it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| But the other thing I wanted to clarify is you mentioned brewing both Venus liquors or wine and distilled liquors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=1995)|
| 0:33:22| and that's not part of the brewpub definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| That's only malt liquors as I read your definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| I have a question about beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| You know, you can serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| You can brew it off-site and bring it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| What we're saying is that it's inappropriate to manufacture beer in the size of the areas that they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| That's all we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| You can brew it off-site, bring it in off-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| You can have it, you know, somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| You're not limited to what you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| You can still serve craft beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Craft beers is on the rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| But these are very small establishments, to argue with Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| But, I mean, he said it's very unlikely that somebody's going to put a brewpub in a C1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| That's an unlikely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| So if it's unlikely, there's no one there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| There's not a pressure to put one there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| I think it's, you know, it just seems to me it's just take it out and put it in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| It's more about the attractiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| To have a 10,000-square-foot restaurant with a 5,000-square-foot brewpub there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| it takes a lot bigger draw than a neighborhood zone is really drawn for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| You can't get the traffic into a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| So if you're going to draw them down there, now you're drawing people from the outside of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| And that's where it conflicts with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| I think it is very appropriate, certainly not against the brewpub, but certainly not against craft beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| But I think it is appropriate to leave it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| If someone wants to come back and amend it at a later date, then we can take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| So, Council, we've got the amendment to the motion, which is we have a motion to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| and now we're amending that motion to delete brewpubs in C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| That's what we're voting on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| Would this apply to both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| A and B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| I think you have to do them separately, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| We have to do them separately, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2119)|

| 0:36:46| which pulls brewpubs out of C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2211)|

| 0:36:56| That passes as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| 9-B is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| To amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B zoning regulations, Articles 2, 4, and 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| regarding definitions and development standards for small breweries, wineries, and distilleries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| in certain commercial and industrial zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| Need a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| And I move to amend to, again, delete C1 as not allowing, so it does not allow brewpubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| And I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| This is on the amendment to delete brewpubs in C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Just raise your hand so we can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Is it the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Well, now it's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| You've got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| We won it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| You didn't win me over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Mark Camp and Brenda Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| I mean Marshall Sanford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| It's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| It's three, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| So the motion to amend to pull brewpubs out of C1, that passes 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2274)|
| 0:38:04| And now we're on the motion to approve as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| Did you want to say something else, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| No, it's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| And that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| 9C is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B Zoning Regulations Article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| 4 to create a new Section 5.6 entitled C01 Corridor Overlay District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Well, Mark, I appreciate the time you put into this and the conversation we had yesterday about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2313)|
| 0:38:41| And I still have some reservations about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| I've posted on the City Council forum, and I am concerned about where we ended the discussion last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2324)|
| 0:38:54| and that was the example about signs that an overlay could come about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| and they could ask for the signs standards to be diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| And, yes, that would come back before Council, but I just don't think it's appropriate that those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| We micromanage those things here at Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| So I would like to see this go back to MPC with some recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| and my recommendations going back to MPC would be to consider the current standards that cannot be diminished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| including signs, EMCs, anything like that that we've already outlawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| I think that, in addition, there ought to be a minimum area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| or a minimum number of businesses that ought to come together to be able to form an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| And I would propose, I don't know, I'm cognizant and aware of small areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| and you and I talked about several of those yesterday that may not meet this minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| and for that they just wouldn't be in the overlay corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| But I would think it would be somewhere around 30, could be 50, maybe it's 25, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2399)|
| 0:40:06| But I think it ought to be a number that would be a significant number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| I looked at putting those on maybe a certain linear feed of a roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| but I think in certain districts those tend to go on side streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| and so really back to the number of property owners, not businesses, but the number of property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| The third thing is the voting percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| It's in here that 51% of those identified businesses or business property owners could, the voting percentage, 51%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2427)|
| 0:40:38| And I think this is intended to be an ordinance that would bring community together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| and I believe that 51, 49 can be divisive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| I would suggest that that number be at least 60%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| and maybe as high as 75% of the people that can come together to make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| And fourthly, I think there ought to be a public committee to provide oversight to the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2455)|
| 0:41:02| and that's something we've talked about here at council before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| And I think these four things, to me these are big, and I really want the corridor overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2465)|
| 0:41:13| I think that each section of this city and different sections now are very, very unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2473)|
| 0:41:20| and they're very expressive, and they want to express their individuality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| And I think this overlay could give them that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| but I also don't want to take away a lot of structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| and get into zoning, really more zoning issues, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| and undo zoning issues that we've already established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| So it's my recommendation we send this back again to MPC for further recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Yeah, I had a few comments on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| I'm in some general agreement with what George said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| One of the things I wanted to say at first was I appreciate MPC taking a second look that they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| and I think they have improved it by going from guidelines to standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| and having a hard look at some of the things that they put in the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| I think that, for the most part, they are positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| On page 51 of your packet, or subsection 5.6E, the word guidelines still creeped into the title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2532)|
| 0:42:22| so I recommend that we just, as a scrivener, change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| It's something they missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| And in that same subsection E, to address one of the points that George made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| I think that we should, for the sub-items 4 and 5, which are the stormwater management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| and access and the signs, that we should put a phrase at the end of that whole list that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2559)|
| 0:42:45| for items 4 and 5, they shall not be less stringent than the existing requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| I think that's how we deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| Certainly things like setback and lot coverage, that sounds like something that they should have more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| But stormwater management is a big deal in terms of complying with EPA standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| and we certainly can't afford to have them less stringent than the city stormwater requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| And on signs, if they've got a problem with the sign regulation as finally approved, adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| whatever, when it gets done, they can go for a variance for that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| As far as the corridor, that shouldn't be the ticket outside of the regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| I'm in agreement we need a uniform regulation of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| But those two changes go a pretty long way towards addressing some of the main concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| I think if you look at F, administration, on item number 3, where it talks about who decides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| and of course that's the question George raised as to whether it should be an outside committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| or MPC as the director and then the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| In any event, however it reads, I think we need to add a sentence at the end of that subsection F3 that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| non-action by MPC shall constitute a denial and trigger the appeal rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| Because if you just wait the 10 days and nothing happens, has it been denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| Has it been granted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Are you in limbo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| I think we ought to be clear that if they don't want to act on your application, they can't hold you up for ransom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| You then get to file the appeal and start the challenge process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| I think that's healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| It keeps everyone focused on getting it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| And my only other comment was somewhere in the packet on page 52| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| and 53 it looks like the same thing again, just a duplicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| I don't know why that's in there, but I was wondering if we're having two section 5.6s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| or whether that just somehow we went crazy when we printed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| But I'm assuming that's a delete and just a duplicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| As December 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| And what's the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| December 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Oh, that's not the original?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| Well, I wasn't sure, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| What are the second two pages about 5.6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| Is that just a repeat or is that some earlier version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| I don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Is that the earlier version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| I suspect that the version as recommended by the Planning Commission is still in your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| and the version as amended by you last meeting is now in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| So they're both in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| We only need one section 5.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| I think that would be healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| And then the question of the committee, that's a close question, I have to admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| I've heard the arguments on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| MPC took the position that if we have specific standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| and they took a stab at making standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| then it's just a question of carefully looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| and making sure that it, in fact, was done by the applicant in their plan or proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| The counterargument is if it's a gray area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| and lots of things occur when you apply hard rules to specific facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| then there is judgment and discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| And then the question becomes whose judgment and discretion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| And the discussion we had here at the last meeting when we took this up was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| well, if it's going to be a committee or group or someone approving this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| then they should be looking to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| If it's so simple that anyone could do it and it's a checklist item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| then the inspector going over the plans would do the checklist and fall somewhere in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| So there is an argument that there might need to be another body with MPC leading it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| but other input into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| I can go either way on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| but I do think it's important that we not weaken things like signed standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| If we're going to spend a year and a half trying to figure out what's good for this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| we shouldn't just take it away when ten guys get in the back room and say, let's have a corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| I mean, that would undermine the whole zoning concept of having understandable rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| So I would like to see that fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| And I'll abide by the group's decision on whether we pass it as amended or send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| I mean, I think that's an important decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| Councilman Saunders, I do want Council to know there are three people that have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| I've got two lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| I by and large agree with both Councilman Wallace and Councilman Della Volpe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| but I hope that your comments, Councilman Wallace, about signs include more than signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2844)|
| 0:47:32| Include other structures, setbacks, as was mentioned a moment ago, and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| in terms of not diminishing that or not exceeding, rather, whatever the current regulations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2857)|
| 0:47:48| The item regarding governance, if you will, I am a little bit ambivalent about, just like Councilman Della Volpe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2868)|
| 0:47:58| because as you get this process going, and I've been on committees that have to judge, that can get pretty tedious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2878)|
| 0:48:06| And if you have several of these throughout the city, just setting one up, and I agree with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| there needs to be some definition of what it takes to create a corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| But once you've got it set up, the 51 percent, in my mind, is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| That's not a good standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| It needs to be much higher than that, 60, 65, 70, somewhere in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| But then the governance of that can really become tedious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| And if they are standards, of course, the gray areas are the ones that are tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| So I'm a little bit ambivalent on the governance part, but the rest of it, I'm very comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| So I think it does look like to me we probably need to remand this to NPC, get them to study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| Some of the things that we're talking about here are substantial enough that I don't think we can do this by amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2927)|
| 0:48:55| Mr. Frost said he didn't think we could do it by amendment, so that's why I made that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| I was going to comment on that, that I don't think we could or should do it by amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| When and if we do send it back, then let's be very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| Let's give them complete directions as to what we want done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| and what we would expect to see come back or hope to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| You know, I'm in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| I think my district would benefit greatly when we get this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| but it's important that we get it right and not have to go back and forth with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| So I want to applaud Councilman Wallace for bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| I think it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| I'll be supportive of sending it back, but let's send it back with, you know, again, clear direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| and bring it back with something that will benefit the whole city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| and I look forward to being able to see it in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| So I'll be supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| I think the concept is sound, and I have thought that for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| but the amendments are suggestions from Councilman Wallace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| suggestions from Councilman De La Vope, Councilman Saunders' comments, Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| I completely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| This is the third time that this will have gone through MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| and I really hope this time that there's listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| and what comes back to us very much looks like what we've talked about tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| and what we want to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| because I don't think when it came back to us after the last send-back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| showed this kind of change that we had discussed and we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| So I will be supporting sending this back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| but I really want it to come back with our suggestions and thoughts included, not just cast aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3037)|
| 0:50:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Council, we have a motion to send this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| There are three people who have signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| so I'm going to call on them to see if they still wish to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| This is in this order, Mary English, Joyce Feld, and Carlene Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| Does anybody wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| Mary, please come up as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| I'll just address the last couple of things that were said with regard to sending it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| because it sounds like what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| is we want to send it back to MPC and have them do what we tell them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| Well, frankly, council doesn't have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| You can ask them to consider various issues and ask them to look at the various things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3088)|
| 0:51:35| such as Councilman Wallace talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| but you do not have the authority to tell them to have it look like this when it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3098)|
| 0:51:46| You can say, please look at this and use your best judgment in coming up with an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| that addresses these issues and give us your best recommendation with regard to those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| But as long as they look at those issues when it comes back, then you can fix it however you want it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| because you have the ultimate authority with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| But when it goes to MPC, you can't tell them what it has to look like when it comes back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| And I just want that to be clear, and I'm not sure that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| or would have been to the average person listening to that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| It's a hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| I guess the question I have then is, are there certain things that could be addressed by amendment tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| And maybe let's just, for the sake of discussion, the 51%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3145)|
| 0:52:32| The answer to that question is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| And just as Mr. Frost advised you, we have to be able to show that MPC at least looked at the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3154)|
| 0:52:43| And there are a number of things that you discussed that, looking at the record, it's impossible to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| that they looked at this issue or that issue that you talked about in your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| And unless we can show on the record that they looked at that issue, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| You need their recommendation on that issue one way or the other, even if you disagree with their issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| So they come back, for sake of argument, they come back and say it's still 51%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| We disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Then can we draw an amendment and say we want it to be X?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| Ms. English, name and address, please, and I'll time you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Mary English, 810 Oak Grove Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| I'm speaking on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| and its president, Kim Love, regarding this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| And I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| We do support the concept underlying the ordinance, but we've got a couple of major concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| and these have been talked about, but we have a slightly different take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| Not very, but in any case, particularly given the fact that a CO1 district could have more lenient standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3227)|
| 0:53:57| than would otherwise apply, not only with regard to higher sign heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| but also other things that may or may not have been mentioned, smaller setbacks, less landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3242)|
| 0:54:10| brighter lighting, all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| For this reason, the enabling ordinance should require, we would argue, special measures for both public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3252)|
| 0:54:20| and public participation whenever a CO1 district is proposed to be either created or modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3260)|
| 0:54:28| Both of those would require an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| Now, these measures should include immediate notice by the NPC to all of the property owners in the proposed district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3271)|
| 0:54:40| and they also should include a city council workshop with a public forum on the proposed new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3280)|
| 0:54:48| or modified district before the district and its standards are formally considered for adoption by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3288)|
| 0:54:57| And certainly more than just the business owners in a district, but others in areas surrounding the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| will be interested in these provisions of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| And the second thing, we are concerned about the administration of a CO1 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| in particular the review of the development plan, the approval or denial of the certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| Those will largely rely on the judgment of the executive director of NBC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3319)|
| 0:55:26| We do not doubt the competence of the current director, but we would argue that to limit administrative discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3326)|
| 0:55:35| the enabling ordinance should require both explicit and detailed standards be spelled out in that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3335)|
| 0:55:44| Excuse me, I've got a bad cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| So I want to thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| Thank you, Ms. English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| Appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| Okay, Joyce Feld, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Thank you, city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| I'm going to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, and I'm here as president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| And I want to say that we support the creation of corridor overlay districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| but we do think, as it's been discussed here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| we do think it's important that language be included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| which would prohibit the ability to exceed the standards already specified for that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| And these standards should include but not necessarily be limited to building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| and related development characteristics, lot characteristics, including setbacks and lot coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| landscaping and lighting, signs, and any other relevant standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| We understand that the intent of creating the corridor overlay district is to improve a section of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| and for this reason we support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| But we think that including this language will ensure that this intention is preserved not just for the near future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3412)|
| 0:56:59| but for the distant future as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| So I'm glad to hear that you all share that concern and that this will go back for further study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Thank you, Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| Now, Ms. Malone, again, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| Well, it's really a privilege to come and address this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3433)|
| 0:57:19| I mean, I know how hard all of you have worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| Again, on behalf of the community forum and also part of this on behalf of myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| and I'll try to make the distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Yes, our concern was limited to the fact that unlike all other overlays in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| there was no public body or public process in the review of proposed plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| The purpose of that review is to make certain that the development plan submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| was consistent with the adopted standards or guidelines of the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| The public is left out of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| We renew that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| We are even more convinced than ever that discretion must be part of the decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3476)|
| 0:58:04| We think it is impossible to identify and properly deal with all design elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| and all possible contingencies through some set of incomplete and mechanically applied standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| And one of you is a design professional, and I'm hoping he will understand what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3495)|
| 0:58:23| In order to think of all contingencies and have standards so complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| it would require that we think of everything, every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| We don't think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| We think that it is possible, regrettably, that a development plan could meet all the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| that one could go and check off all the boxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| and we could end up with a product that resembles the Edsel instead of the classic Corvette that we were hoping for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| That is why we think that the exercise of discretion is necessary at the time of the development plan submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3526)|
| 0:58:53| We also have an additional concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| and that concern is that the standards of the base zone can be varied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| and made more or less restrictive than the base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| And here I will speak mainly on my own behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| The more that I have read and considered this, the clearer some things have become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| All overlays, all overlays, allow the base zones to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| the overlay to be more or less restrictive than the requirements of the base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| However, and it's a big however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| all other overlays have certain characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| One, they are self-limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| Two, they are very specific as to their purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| And three, as a result of being self-limiting and very specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| it is possible to develop a citywide understanding and consensus of the specific purpose of the overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| and that purpose is indeed important and worthy of additional consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3580)|
| 0:59:48| So when we decided as a city that downtown design was necessary, we put in place an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| When we decided that historic neighborhoods are worthy of preserving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| and technology is worth attracting with a technology park, we put in overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| We also decided as a community that infill development in pre-Second World War neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3602)|
| 1:00:11| should acknowledge the streetscape of the neighborhood and the design style of the remaining structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| Because we have self-limiting, specifically stated purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| because we decided these things are valuable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| we are comfortable allowing the requirements of the base zone to be made more or less restrictive by the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3625)|
| 1:00:32| Because the variance from the base zone restriction is in the name of some specific thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3632)|
| 1:00:40| It's in the name of historic zoning, historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| It's in the name of attracting technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| So we are comfortable with varying the standards of the base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| This is the problem with the corridor overlay as presently being reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| It is not self-limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| The purpose is broad and general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| It is all things to all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| And therefore, there is no consensus regarding the specific purpose or expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| that would come out of such an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| Unfortunately, and I agree with the idea that we want to protect and we want to improve our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| Unfortunately, there is so much to be done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| There is no easy fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| There is a lot more thought that needs to go into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| And I appreciate all of you who have struggled so hard with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| I think in the long run, we will come up with a better product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| And thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Thank you, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| Okay, Council, we have a motion to send the corridor overlay district back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3693)|
| 1:01:40| to consider several of the recommendations that have been discussed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3706)|

| 1:06:36| I guess I'm still confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=3996)|

| 1:08:21| is part of a plan to ultimately connect everything to Maryville and maybe even to the mountains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4101)|

| 1:09:43| I just turned it on, if I may, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| I don't know if Vicki is here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| She is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| But someone else is here, if not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Ms. Hatfield is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| My question is, should we be acting on this now before we do whatever salary survey you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| planning to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| This would not have, the salary survey we're doing wouldn't have any impact on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| This is primarily the creation of some new job classes that don't currently exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| And there are needs that have sort of come up since the last class comp ordinance came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| to you in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| So I sort of saved them up until I have enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| But these are needs by departments that we've identified over the past few months, and these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| would not be addressed through the salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| One other question, and that is, we're not necessarily hiring more employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| We're simply setting up different classifications, and people might be moved into them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| None of these represent an increase in force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| Some of these are to basically reclassify employees that are currently in a classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| but maybe it's over time it has not become a good match for what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| Better describing the jobs, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| Or where a department has a need, and they currently don't have an individual identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| but they do plan to fill from within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| You've answered my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| These are all currently budgeted positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| So there's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4265)|

| 1:11:18| and offering an annual permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| Yeah, sorry to jump in again, but 12B, C, and D are all about tents, and some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| have to do with whether you can cook in a tent or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| Some of them have to do with whether you can have a permit for a year or longer, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| threshold size perhaps being increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| Is there someone here that can tell us why are we doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| What exactly is at stake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| I understand that our current procedures might be considered cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| Is there any specific use that we have in mind, or are we just talking about house cleaning here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| I don't really understand where we're taking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| Our business liaison, Patricia Robledo, will address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Yeah, this is cleaning up the ordinance and bringing it up to date in line with the Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| with the International Building Code and the Fire Code, and it's also making it easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| for businesses to get a temporary tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4334)|
| 1:12:20| Before it was much harder to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| Even pop-up tents needed to be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| Now it's a larger size according to the International Fire Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| If we keep the International Fire Code as it is right now, if you don't agree with this change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4351)|
| 1:12:38| then special events would probably not be able to happen in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| because you wouldn't be able to have outdoor events, festivals and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| So, yeah, it is cleaning it up, and so it is looking at it from the different departments that are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4368)|
| 1:12:56| Okay, but it's more about having commercial special event kinds of permits and privileges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| and there's no other purpose here that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| It's getting a permit for a tent, whether you're a business and you have a grand opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| or if the weather is not going to be nice and you want to have the outdoor event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| before you would have to get that permit like a month ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| And that's if you don't know what the forecast is going to do a month away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| So this is making it easier for them to get that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| Well, thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| I appreciate the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| The annual permit as well is a nice option for businesses that do put up the tents on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4413)|
| 1:13:41| because they can then have an annual permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| There's a lot of tents in one place for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| It's just they can have an annual permit and put up tents around wherever the event is held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4432)|

| 1:15:00| Yeah, since we have Mark here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4500)|

| 1:15:09| restrictions or guidelines like you have in here will apply to other residential zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4509)|
| 1:15:16| so that we'll all know what a home office is and what it can't be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| Because that's really the goal here is to define it carefully so it's different than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4520)|

| 1:15:42| we have a generic definition as well that you can just look to as interpreting our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4548)|

| 1:15:57| exclusively with the R-1E zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4557)|

| 1:16:08| and in working with the Forest Heights Neighborhood Group, they wanted to limit it to the R-1E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140107?start=4568)|
