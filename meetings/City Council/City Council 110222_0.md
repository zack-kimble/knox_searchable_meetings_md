| 0:01:27| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Everyone is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| Now we will need a motion to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=92)|
| 0:01:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| As having so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| I have one item, and that is 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=109)|
| 0:02:00| Item 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| What was the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| Withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| As have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| Mr. Mayor, may I say something regarding that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| The 12A was the standard knitting mills proposal that we looked at two weeks ago and postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| and I think many of us were able to attend the community meeting out at the Cancer Y,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| and we had a very robust discussion and I think came out with a consensus in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| that night that maybe some more time was needed to more fully develop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| Something that was in your packet tonight, I had a conversation with our greenways coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| It's this yellow sheet, and it's just something for the council members to take home and look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| and it has to do with proposed plans for finishing out the First Creek greenway system in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=175)|
| 0:03:02| which is referenced in the Magnolia Avenue Corridor Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| So I guess it's something to put on the shelf at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| but to think about in the back of your minds as we go forward with a coordinated effort to redevelop this whole area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| I'm hopeful that the First Creek Greenway Plan will be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| I think it's relevant because our Office of Greenways has already made an application to TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| for the easement underneath the interstate to connect the two sides, east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| And so, as you know, building greenways is something that requires a lot of patience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| and it's sort of stitching together short linkages, and that linkage is currently underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| and hopefully it will improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| So I wanted everybody to have that as we think about this maybe a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| Any items for a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| Items requested to be added by motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| Consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| 11H through 11L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| Do we need a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| I might be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| I don't have a problem with those being on the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| I would draw my fellow Councilmembers' attention to 11J in that packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| and I think that illustrates the issues we're going to be confronting over the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| and that is that we have a retirement program that has generous early retirement features to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=266)|
| 0:04:35| and there is a cost to that, and we're going to be struggling with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| I don't think we need to debate that here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| and I'm sure the person who is represented by that item has done a valuable service to our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| but it illustrates the kind of cost that we can have when we have the rules that we currently have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| and the ones that are pushing us towards economic difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| So I'd urge my fellow Councilpeople to look at that one and take your calculator out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| and think about the ultimate cost to the city and how we deal with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| as this comes up time and time again in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Under Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| We need to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| We have a motion on the floor, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| Under Mayor's Report, I have a couple of things to announce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| I want to announce the Small Business Conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| The City of Knoxville is partnering with several organizations to host the annual Small Business Conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=335)|
| 0:05:43| which will be March the 9th at Pellissippi State, the Magnolia Avenue Campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=343)|
| 0:05:50| The event is set for 8.30 a.m. until noon that Wednesday, and it is, as always, is free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=350)|
| 0:05:59| And it's aimed at helping small businesses better compete for government contract and other opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=359)|
| 0:06:07| Also, the Mardi Gras Parade, the fourth annual costume parade for dogs and their owners in downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=367)|
| 0:06:15| is set for 11 a.m. Saturday, March the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| And it will begin at the city's pet-safe downtown dog park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| The park is located at the corner of Summit Hill Drive and Central Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| and a festival on Market Square will follow from noon to 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| This is an event sponsored by the city and Young-Williams Animal Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| with proceeds going to assist in the work of the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=399)|
| 0:06:46| Also, as Councilman Bailey mentioned in his prayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| let us remember former Councilman Mark Brown and passing of his wife, Marcia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=410)|
| 0:06:57| and certainly we're going to keep them in our prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| And we have funeral arrangements here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| It will be Friday, February the 25th, receiving of friends from 5.30 to 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=426)|
| 0:07:13| The funeral service will be at 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| That's at Mount Zion Baptist Church on Brooks Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| So let us remember that family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| Also, we want to congratulate, on a very much lighter note, Trevor Bain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| who won the Daytona 500, and let's wish him well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=450)|
| 0:07:37| That's a major thing in the sports world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| And that's all that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| Any other thoughts from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| I have a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| Those people who live on Oak Ridge Highway, Western Avenue, State Route 62,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| and have been looking at the Orange Barrels, there is movement and it is a closer project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=474)|
| 0:08:01| In about three weeks, there will be a website that will give updates on daily detours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| the whole action plan for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| That website should be operational in about three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| I think there will probably be a link from the city and then a TDOT link also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| On March the 3rd, the Westview community will be holding a meeting with the Neighborhood Watch organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=496)|
| 0:08:23| and that starts at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| And, Mayor, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| I've been getting a number of questions, and perhaps other Council members have too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| about the pension committee that has been formed or is being formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| Two or three questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| A, has it been formed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| B, will the meetings be sunshined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| And C, when will the committee begin its work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| I'm going to refer that question to the chairperson, which is Dr. Bill Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| Thank you, Mayor and Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| We are just about finalized the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| It's taken a little longer than we would have liked because the employee groups are choosing their own members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| and the pension board and other constituencies rather than appoint folks to represent groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| We let them choose their own, and that took a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| And we're finalizing one final person's ability to participate, but I'd say within a day or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| we should have the names able to be released publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| And the meetings, we're looking to begin it next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| and begin with a couple of educational sessions to bring everybody up to date on the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| what it is and its history and then some other underlying aspects that would help the group do its work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=572)|
| 0:09:39| We haven't really, those meetings will be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| Now, we haven't made a final decision and probably have some internal discussion on how open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| or closed the actual deliberations will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| Simply, we feel that in our experience with the Mercer committee that being able to be frank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=591)|
| 0:09:59| in the dialogue is of utmost importance in this and there are times that would be less likely to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=599)|
| 0:10:07| But that's not, that option hasn't been arrived at or finalized yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| but I would say we're definitely, the educational sessions would be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| The actual deliberations, whether some or all or none, would be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| We'll have to get the groups and discuss and we'll obviously make our recommendation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| Would you keep council updated on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| How that is going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| I don't know about others, but I am getting a lot of questions about that particular group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Councilman, I believe the council will have a representative on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| Vice Mayor Bailey, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| I selected Councilman Greaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| He's accepted, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| And I'm recognizing you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| I just wanted to go through the council's workshop schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| We've had a few changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| On March the 17th, we'll have the Councilmatic Redistricting Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| On April the 14th, we will have the Community Development Annual Action Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=662)|
| 0:11:09| And on April the 28th, we'll have the Ridgetop Protection Plan Workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| Those will all be here in the large assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| I also wanted to mention the Legislative Budget Hearing, May 5th and the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| And that's also here in the assembly room, main assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| I don't see any lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Oh, Councilman Delavaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| I just wanted to ask you a question, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| You had mentioned that small business conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| and I neglected to write the actual date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| I had the time down, 830 to noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| But it's an important thing because we've just gotten through our own workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| of how some small businesses are having difficulty doing business with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| And I think it bears repeating for people out there who might be interested in attending that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| and learning how better to do business with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| It's going to be March the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| And it's from 830 until 12 noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| And I'll just repeat, the location is Pellissippi State on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| So we'll look forward to participating in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| Ms. Mitchell, if we could go to our ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=738)|

| 0:14:40| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=881)|

| 0:14:49| He was hiding, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| I think he was asked to, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| I just wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| I don't see Mr. York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Is he here perhaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Do I understand this to be essentially the execution of this building's portion of the Ameresco plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=904)|
| 0:15:13| and does the loan aspect add anything to the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| In other words, is this simply an implementation of getting this part of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| with energy efficient installation in it so we can realize the benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| What we have for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Excuse me, Mr. York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| If you would, give your name and address just for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| Jim York, 5015 Shannon Run Drive, Knoxville 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| And tell us who you are because the people are watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| They may not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| I serve as finance director for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| In answer to your question, the city currently has a lease agreement for the entire cost of the Ameresco project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=949)|
| 0:15:59| A portion of that was specifically designed to benefit this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| Because of the way the building is owned, the building is technically owned by PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=965)|
| 0:16:14| If you go back beyond that, there's roughly a third interest that's held by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| and two-thirds held by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| So what we have attempted to do is to carve out the portion that's specifically related to this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=982)|
| 0:16:30| and have structured that in a financing arrangement as a loan to PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| to be paid back through the rents that are captured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| Sort of a rent abatement as you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| Now, that will be specifically rents charged for the improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| and that way what will happen is each party will basically pay their pro-rata piece for the improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1008)|
| 0:16:57| The city, basically this is just their piggybacking onto our lease agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| but because we have to recover the cost from both parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| we felt it was best to structure it as a loan agreement through PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| As long as I've still got you here, since the next item beyond that, 11D, deals with the loan arrangement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| I was confused in reading that with the idea that in some of the documentation it says it's a zero percent interest rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1037)|
| 0:17:25| and then when you look at an amortization table, there's interest in every single payment for the next, you know, several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1045)|
| 0:17:32| So how do you explain that differential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| We are not charging them any additional interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| Again, the way this is structured, it is just a pro-rata piece of our entire lease agreement for Ameresco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1058)|
| 0:17:49| and we do in fact make principal and interest payments on that lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1069)|
| 0:17:56| And the amortization is structured such that if for some reason this agreement is terminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1076)|
| 0:18:04| we know what the outstanding principal balance is at any one point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| As opposed to the interest that would accrue if it went ongoing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| But the bottom line ultimately is that while we're the one as a city dealing with Ameresco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| the city and the county will be paying their fair share of the improvements, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| That's the heart of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| Did we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Yeah, we've already voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| 11-D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| 11-D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a loan agreement in the principal amount of $1,769,525| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1114)|
| 0:18:42| between the city and the public building authority of the county of Knox and the city of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| for the financing of certain energy conservation services and installations for the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| It's been moved, probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| So are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| 11-E is a resolution authorizing the Knoxville Transportation Authority Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| to enter into an agreement with France McConnell and Seymour LLP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| to provide legal services to Knoxville Area Transit and the KTA Board for a period of five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| with a quarterly retainer of $5,875 until June 30, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| and a quarterly retainer of $6,125 thereafter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| with specified hourly rates for certain litigation and arbitration items not included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| as services covered under the quarterly retainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| Mr. Dellavopia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| I have, I guess, a question about this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| I understand the KTA is using that firm and is happy with their firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| and obviously it's one of the good firms in Knoxville that does and provides legal services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| My concern has to do with the advertisement and solicitation of qualifications or quotations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1193)|
| 0:20:01| and it struck me as somewhat odd that we had one firm only submit qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| and then a body met to select the one firm that did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| and it seems to me that that's a sign that our competitive bidding process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| at least in this instance, is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| Again, I don't have a quarrel with their selection of a competent law firm to represent them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| but I'll be surprised if they had used an alternate means of advertising this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| whether they wouldn't have gotten a number of solicitations or submissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| I did check with the Knoxville Bar Association today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| and they informed me when the PBA was looking for counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| they notified the Knoxville Bar Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| and they were able to in their weekly email blast to notify every attorney who's a member of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| and give them a link to wherever the city's information was and to solicit involvement and submissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1252)|
| 0:20:59| And this process was not followed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| Apparently we just posted it on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| The bottom line is if we're going to have a procurement process that invites competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| and analysis of different entities, I really think we ought to be smarter in how we advertise them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1271)|
| 0:21:19| If there is a unique situation like that where there's an entity that already has a contact mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| it seems remiss to me, at least, that we don't take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| So that coupled with the fact that this is a five-year term, basically, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| it can be terminated by either party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| But with those circumstances, I kind of wish we had a little tighter competition here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| I had somewhat similar concerns, especially when I saw that there was only one firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| And I agree with Mr. Dellavopi in terms of I'm not questioning the qualifications of the firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| but I would be interested to know how the process was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Cindy's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| Ms. McGinnis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| I'm concerned that we just had one firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| And is it customary under other situations with professional services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| if we only have one firm, that you go ahead with those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| Ms. McGinnis, if you would give your name and address and who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| Yes, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Cindy McGinnis, 301 Church Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| I'm the general manager of CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| And Boyce Evans would like to explain some of the purchasing process used here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| and I'd be happy to answer other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| Before he does that, let me recognize Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| Well, I'm adding to Councilman Dellavopi and Councilman Grieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| because I, too, share concerns that we only had one company submit a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| and that this is a five-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| And I find that quite worrisome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| And so I'm interested to hear about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| Sir Boyce Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| I live at 228 Braden Court, Clinton, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| purchasing agent for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| And a couple things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| One is let's talk about what the procurement code says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| The procurement code says, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| you don't even have to compete out professional services, which this is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| But we did by means of a request for qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| Now, when you compete that out, when we compete that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| the only legal means that we're required to use when we compete something like that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| is by the city of Knoxville's website, procurement website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| So everything's been done like it's supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| Secondly, for professional services, while in this instance, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| it's unfortunate that only one firm responded or one entity responded, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| we publish things for architectural engineering firms, professional services, and we, you know, shoot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| sometimes I open 15 to 20 statements of qualifications for people to put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| Same thing with medical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| You know, I mean, professional services cover a wide range of areas, and we always, not always,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| but we normally have a whole lot of entities that put in for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| particularly with the market the way it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| So, frankly, I think to imply that the system does not work is not accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1472)|
| 0:24:40| as the one that opens this stuff every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| It's unfortunate in this one instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| In retrospect, could we have contacted the Bar Association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| Sure, we probably could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| And if I had known only one was going to submit, I would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| But, you know, to tell you the truth, when you start going down the road of, you know, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1496)|
| 0:25:03| putting stuff in all trade magazines and stuff like that and going things way beyond what we have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| which is if you follow that down the road, that's where it goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| it's rather expensive and time-consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| That's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| I'd stand by to answer any questions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| I'll just ask, were you involved in the PBA advertisement for counsel for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| I was not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Because I was told that that system was used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| and it took nothing more than getting information to an entity that had all of those people as members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| So there's 1,500 people that would have gotten a blast emails sending them to your site to explore this further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1542)|
| 0:25:50| And I guess if you're getting into a specialty area as opposed to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| ordering steel beams or something like that, it wouldn't hurt to, if it's the architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| to notify architects, lawyers, doctors, whatever, some organization that feeds out information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| so you do get robust competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| In retrospect, I mean, that would have been a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| and I've definitely made a mental note of it, and we'll do that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| We should also just let everybody know we should also have a much wider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| cast a wider net for everything that we put out there once we get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| I think it's supposed to be in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| I mentioned at the workshop a couple weeks ago where iSupplier kicks out email blasts to everybody that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| registered for a certain type of product or service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| and tells them the bid or RFQ or RFP, as the case may be, is out there for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| So there's definitely good news or even better news there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1603)|
| 0:26:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| What would it take to reissue this, to redo this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1618)|
| 0:27:10| We just declare the request for qualifications canceled and then to issue another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1630)|
| 0:27:20| Would you then go, would you consider going through the Bar Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| or at least making an announcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| I would do that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| I guess I have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Could you award this for less than the five-year period and then pursue an earlier renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| where you follow that process if there was some urgency to what you're doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| In other words, do you have to go out five years or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| You don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| No, sir, you don't have to go five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| I think the thought process, I would have to look at the request for qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| It's been a while since I saw that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| but I believe the thought process there was the continuity of the legal counsel to that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1679)|
| 0:28:08| Sure, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| And you don't pick the low bidder for your doctor or your lawyer or your architect, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| You pick someone who provides you the service you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| But since we selected a process of sort of evaluating the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| I was just curious if there was a way to do it for a shorter period of time and then go out again or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| It can be done for a shorter period of time, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| I'd like to recognize Deputy Mayor Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| He seems to have something to contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| Thank you, Councilmember Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| I appreciate, first of all, the spirit of the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| because what is important for the city is to have as many interested parties as we can in our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1727)|
| 0:28:55| And we certainly want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| We want to maximize all our efforts in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| But as Boyce explained, there is a very defined process for us to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1740)|
| 0:29:07| And for professional services, we can actually negotiate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| In this case, we did post it and went through the normal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| And I think Councilmember Della Vopi touched on this point about the specialty here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1757)|
| 0:29:24| And I think there is, in mass transportation, a certain amount of specialty to that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| as we learn every day as we work with CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| And I think it would be good, and I would hope would bring some confidence to Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| if you heard from Cindy, to talk about the relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| and what it is we're looking for in the legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| and why she felt the decision was made to choose this firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| and why that was important in their judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| John Lawhorn has been the KTA representative or the KTA attorney for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| prior to when I started working with CAT five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| And Mr. Martin is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| There are some fairly technical regulations and circulars that apply to mass transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1815)|
| 0:30:23| that don't apply to any other department of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| I think Chris Woodhull was very instrumental and very involved, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| when we were dealing with the ADA issues, the regulations on ADA alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| probably about half an inch thick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| There are just issues that you need to be very familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| where you can find the answers and just have a great appreciation for the spirit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| in which the regulations and the circulars were made in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| And that's why I think it helps to have continuity with your legal services firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1856)|
| 0:31:04| And I could list many other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| Purchasing by America, well, John Lawhorn doesn't get so involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| And also with service changes, public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| these are the type of issues that the KTA attorney has to review for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| I appreciate the comments and the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| and I think I speak for most council members, if not all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| that no matter what we decide to do in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| it's really not a reflection on the law firm that is the subject because, as I know them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1894)|
| 0:31:41| they're an outstanding, reputable law firm and would do a very good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| And I appreciate the more specifics and the focus and the expertise that's required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| but I just wanted to point that out because I probably speak on behalf of most of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| How long have they had the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| Does it say that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| I don't believe it says that in your material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| It's been quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| I think it's been since the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| That's a year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| I mean, it just makes sense to me for the institutional knowledge to go out and start from scratch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| because you have to totally start from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| But I understand the questions, but to go back and start that process over, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| would just really be, could be detrimental, very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| And I'm comfortable with moving forward with it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| You know, I think what we've heard tonight is that, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| Council's not comfortable with the situation where we only see that there is one respondent to a request for qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| On the other hand, I think what we heard from the Purchasing Department is that the City Purchasing Department has gone above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| and beyond the requirements in our code in that professional services contracts aren't even required to be posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| or competitively bid or competitively qualified, I guess, since this was a request for qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| So we did go above and beyond in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| And I guess I would express some caution as we try to give advisement to the Procurement Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| or the Purchasing Department in that if we specify, well, if it has to do with legal services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| you've always got to notify the Bar Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| Well, I feel like when we start selecting one organization, there's always going to be another one that's left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| You know, we had a workshop with the Black Business Contractors Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| Well, if we specified, you know, make sure and let that organization know when you're bidding something that has to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| contracting, well, then what about the Associated General Contractors or the Independent Contractors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| You know, there's always going to be different umbrella associations involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| and I certainly don't have the expertise that our Purchasing Department does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| but maybe by posting it in newspapers or to the website, we're more fair than trying to select a particular constituent group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2045)|
| 0:34:14| whether it be an association like the Bar Association or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| So I'm comfortable with moving forward on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| although I think we all agree that in the future we sure hope that we would see a number of qualifications submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2061)|
| 0:34:29| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Well, I'll just footnote her comment with how I got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| I was reading the agenda information sheet that seemed to be portraying what was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| and two sentences stood out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| It said, Federal law requires the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| as a recipient of Federal Transit Administration funds for the Knoxville Area Transit CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| undertake a procurement process with regard to professional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| An RFQ, or request for quote, was issued to determine the most qualified firm to provide the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| The next sentence then goes on to say one firm submitted qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| I was arguing only about the process and not necessarily the results or the need to keep continuity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2105)|
| 0:35:13| but it read like we really were pounding the turf to find the one firm that we really wanted to do business with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| and the reality is we didn't get any comparative data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| and I think as a procurement person I'd want to question my process if that's really my objective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| to go out there and see if I can find the best person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| Maybe something has sprung up in the last 40 years that there's another qualified person out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| So that was the only reason for my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| We do not have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| I'll make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| 11F is a resolution approving the first amendment to the economic impact plan for North Shore Town Center Economic Development Area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| allowing the developers to use tax increment financing to secure a loan to finance the public improvements for the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| and to pay said loan using the TIF revenues as collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Before we even have a motion on the floor regarding this agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| I'd like to let my colleagues know that I'll be recusing myself from this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| I have consulted with our council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| and he has let me know that while I do not have a legal conflict of interest in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| my family does own property just across the street from this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| and so to avoid even the appearance of a conflict, I'll be sitting back on this discussion and this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| I believe I understand the purpose for this TIF or tax incentive type financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| but I wonder if someone can tell us a little bit about the history going back to 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| Apparently this North Shore Town Center was sort of off and running until the economy took it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2230)|
| 0:37:18| and we have new owners that have taken it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| And this relates, as I understand the information, to the $3 million sort of commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2241)|
| 0:37:30| if that's the right word, that we have to help with the road improvements through the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| It's unusual to me in this sense that I understand if we have an area that's run down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| or has difficulty developing that a TIF sometimes makes possible financing that wouldn't otherwise be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2262)|
| 0:37:53| Now, in this situation, we have this North Shore Town Center project, which maybe it has similar difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2273)|
| 0:38:01| Everyone has difficulties in this environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| But we have a development by a large entity with a prosperous area of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2284)|
| 0:38:12| And so the use of the TIF there kind of makes you wonder, are we doing the right thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| I just wanted to know the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| We've obviously engaged, maybe Mr. Wetzel is the one to tell us or Mr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| but we were engaged back in 2006 to help them get the road work done on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| So tell us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| This has an interesting history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| The original developer came to us with an idea for a town center development, which we had the zone for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2314)|
| 0:38:42| but nobody had ever done, which we were all in along with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| This has always been a cooperative effort with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| We're excited about supporting in that area and asked for an industrial development board TIF, a different kind of TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2327)|
| 0:38:56| And you're right, most all of them we've taken through KCDC, and they require blighted areas somewhere in a redevelopment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| and that's been the logic and genesis of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| This one is more an economic development tool rather than a blight removal tool going through the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| And the reason that the city, along with the county, supported that development was that it didn't go into the actual buildings itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2351)|
| 0:39:22| or construction, it was for road improvements that the developer might normally be or would normally be responsible for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| but road improvements that were already needed along North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| and to aid that were on the list as road improvements that would be down the line that the city would have to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2372)|
| 0:39:41| This more sped them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| And subsequent to the original approval to support the town center concept, which had walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| it had the sort of development you'd like to see, an urban kind of development that was very efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| Everything changed because of the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| That first developer was unable to follow through on that and put it for sale or got into difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| I think if we needed to, we could call on Mr. Harrison or others to develop how that went to the next folks who subsequently took it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2403)|
| 0:40:12| But they came to this council with a change in zoning and said we could make this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| if we were allowed some larger entities to be in there and altered part of the town center concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| and you recall we had some discussion on that just a few months back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| That meant we had to amend the economic development plan that supported the TIF because it was a different project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2425)|
| 0:40:32| and hence that's why we're back tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| The road improvement logic is the same as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| It just represents a slight change to represent economic conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| the underlying logic still being that this would enable a very valuable development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2441)|
| 0:40:48| Secondly, one other change has been, and, again, we've been partnering with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| and this has gone through the county IDB, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| Knox County has a school that they're locating there that this helps support as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| So it's part of a team effort to that extent to get these road improvements paid for by the tax revenues for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2459)|
| 0:41:07| I could turn it over for any more details either to Mr. Harrison or Mr. Leslie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| I appreciate that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| I guess I would ask the win-win for the taxpayers is that this is a good type of development that will, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2471)|
| 0:41:19| redound to the benefit of the city as a whole in terms of sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| or other development values that will come our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| In other words, what do we get out of it as citizens in this TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| And, again, in all of our approaches, we do look for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| There's the but-for and there's the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| The but-for is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| This could not work without this aid, but then why are we still doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| I accept your explanation of the but-for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| Tell me about the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| The public interest here is that this allows us to get a development of good density in an area of a type we'd like to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2503)|
| 0:41:54| that hasn't otherwise taken place in now a very challenging area with some road system that doesn't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| It also, we think, will bring about a lot of sales tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| a lot of that coming from outside of Knox County because of its location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| We have every reason to believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| So it's an economic play, a development play as well, and it's, we think, essential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2529)|
| 0:42:17| given the lay of the transportation arteries out there, to have this transportation aid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| and that in the long-term benefits Knoxville citizens, Knox County citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| by having this road improvements to allow all that to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| As you see, and have seen the drawings and the sketches and so forth, this is a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| this would be, is a very valuable, I mean, this is the kind of development we would like to incur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| This is far from just a strip development, not to denigrate that, but that you might normally see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| But the price of admission is we give up some of the property tax, but there are sales tax benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| as well as sound development benefits that usually we realize, and we do get the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| That pretty well sums it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| And eventually it's full-fledged on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| Yes, very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| And could you just explain the process that the administration goes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| who reviews this before it's recommended to us, because I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| I appreciate that, Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| On this one, actually this came sufficiently early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| We didn't have our present system totally in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| but a developer will come to us with a proposal and will have to then explain that the city participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2603)|
| 0:43:32| in what would otherwise be a private economic effort was needed, the but-for effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| and really show that there was a real advantage to having this and really make that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| And we have that internally reviewed by Deputy Mayor Martin and Mr. Wetzel and I and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2622)|
| 0:43:49| and we also, if it involves county taxes, bring in John Troyer as well and do a review of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| Then depending whether it's a KCDC or an IDB, there's a public hearing, that thing is publicized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2634)|
| 0:44:02| and then it comes to council and commission for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| But it always has a good internal review that many, I might add, we don't want to publicize them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| because it's not fair to the proposals, but many of them don't survive that initial scrutiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| because we either think that we're not convinced it couldn't happen without the TIF, that it would happen anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| or on the other hand, the public benefit isn't as pronounced as we would like it to be to take this step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2663)|
| 0:44:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| I'm generally a little bit reluctant and skittish when it comes to the TIF issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| but I think that in the case of this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| the return on this investment will so far surpass the investment that we cannot ignore it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2681)|
| 0:44:49| And so I will be supporting this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Yeah, I will be supporting it as well, but I think some of these things need airing before we vote because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| I mean, we have the benefit of this packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| I guess if anyone wants to go online and look it up, they might too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| But it is a commitment of their dollars, and I think they're entitled to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| so I'd like to see those things aired when they come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| Seeing no further lights, I believe we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110222?start=2723)|
