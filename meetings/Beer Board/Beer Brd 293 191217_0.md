| 0:01:00| I'm going to call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=60)|
| 0:01:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=62)|
| 0:01:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=63)|
| 0:01:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| We have none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Beer permits request in front of us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| Several of them are going to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| So we'll get right to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=70)|
| 0:01:12| So for those that we will hear when I call the name of the business applying for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| permit, please come to the podium, speak into the microphone, state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| Applicants who are approved, pending final documentation, need to bring the completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=82)|
| 0:01:27| taxed office during business hours. And applicants who have their permit approved tonight can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=87)|
| 0:01:33| pick up their permit at the end of the meeting. That being said, we'll get right to it. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=93)|
| 0:01:40| above us. We're requesting a referral until January. We need a motion to postpone for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=100)|
| 0:01:47| 30 days. Move to postpone for 30 days. Second. All those in favor say aye. Aye. All right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=107)|
| 0:01:54| dead end barbecue. He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=114)|
| 0:02:07| My name is George. You were 36 21 Sullivan Avenue. I'm the owner of dead end barbecue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| Okay. Okay, George. Thank you. Officer Taylor. No applicable record. Okay. The file is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=132)|
| 0:02:19| complete. Perfect. Move to approve. Second. You have a question there, Mr. Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=139)|
| 0:02:27| No, I didn't know my light was on. He's still trying to figure out how that button works. I thought he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=147)|
| 0:02:34| gonna get you, Mr. Ewerkson. Okay, we have a motion and a second to approve. All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| Aye. Thank you. Thank you. I won't be sending you invitations. Yeah, thank you. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| Go Puff Knoxville downtown. We're also requesting a referral. Okay, so I need a motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=164)|
| 0:02:54| for 30 days. Motion to postpone for 30 days. Second. Is, they still don't have a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=174)|
| 0:03:03| out of the ground yet, do they? No. That's my understanding based on police reporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=183)|
| 0:03:11| but they did not mention that factor specifically in their email, but. I mean, it's 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=191)|
| 0:03:18| 30 days isn't long enough, is it? Nah. I wouldn't think so. The email was specifically January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=198)|
| 0:03:26| they've said, but. The footers have been poured, but that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=206)|
| 0:03:34| You want me to amend the motion? You want to? That's up to you. You'll have a new chairman in 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=214)|
| 0:03:48| so you all can decide how you want to do it. Okay, well we have a motion and a second to postpone it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=228)|
| 0:03:58| That's what they asked for. They asked you for a 30-day postponement? Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| They're apparently expecting a very active New Year's. I would think. They don't need a building to be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=243)|
| 0:04:11| pending documentation, right? Right, but they need fire inspection and all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| and I bet they're six months out from all that. So then, in essence, when was their background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=256)|
| 0:04:28| Their original application was? August, their background checks were completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=268)|
| 0:04:35| And they've been postponed June, July, August, September. Okay, and the consequence of us not giving them a 30-day postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=275)|
| 0:04:48| is they have to reapply and pay again. Correct. Okay, let's postpone them 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=288)|
| 0:04:57| Can I amend my motion to postpone 60 days? Second. That's also very ambitious. It is ambitious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=297)|
| 0:05:06| Well, I mean, do we want to postpone it for? Then we end up getting way past the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| Sergeant Coward, do you have a feeling about that? You are not. You're hiding over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| That's Sergeant Taylor, number one. It's not sergeant, it's officer. Oh, so sorry. Don't promote me yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=319)|
| 0:05:27| I could not see. I missed it. How long is the background check good for? Yeah, that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=327)|
| 0:05:36| How long is the background check? A year. A year. Surely they'll have it done by August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| Let's start with 60 days and then we can, somebody ought to reach out to them and say, let's get it, you know, get it realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=342)|
| 0:05:49| I was going to say to members of the board, we represent Go Puff and I will be glad to find out a little bit more about the timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=349)|
| 0:05:56| We've gotten incomplete information. I had no idea that they're just footers poured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| I believe 60 days is aggressive, but if we could ask for a 60 day deferral and then during that period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| we'll try to have a more realistic timeframe. If we need to do another background check, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| So we have a motion for 60 days and a second, I think. All those in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| Okay. You're good with that? Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| Lancer Hospitality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| Norman Block, 2909 Raleigh Lane, Knoxville. Okay. Officer Taylor. No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=389)|
| 0:06:36| We only need the surrender of the current permit. Okay. Perfect. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=396)|
| 0:06:44| Move to approve pending final documentation. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| She just has her light on for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| Any other questions? All those in favor, say aye. Aye. I'm still going to vote against. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| All right. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| 8 yeses, 1 no. Okay. La Fuentes Mexican Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| They're on, they're asked to be postponed, right Mark? Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| Okay. For 30 days or? Yes, sir. For 30 days. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| They're still having problems getting their background check. Is that where that's hung up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| It is. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| Move to postpone, I'm sorry. 30 days. Move to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| How many times have we postponed this long? All those in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| Let's postpone 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| Lindsay Nelson Stadium. Here we go. Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| Members of the Beer Board, I'm Will Cheek, Legal Counsel to Aramark Sports and Entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| I have Mike McDonald from Aramark also. Application for two new stadiums, the softball, baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=471)|
| 0:08:01| We have filed a revised alcohol compliance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=481)|
| 0:08:07| I just want to let folks know in case they wondered what we've changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| We changed the title page to add the two new venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| After page 28, we have inserted some numbers about staffing at the two venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| They're significantly smaller. They have average attendance of 17 and 1800 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| With the exception of the change on the front page and the new page after page 28,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| this is the same compliance policy that we submitted before. I just want to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| I understand that some of the members of the board may have some questions about the Garth Brooks concert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| We're here to entertain those as well as this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| Okay, so we'll do the formality. Officer Taylor. No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| We need the certificate of zoning, building inspection approval, and fire prevention approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| We're talking about Lindsay Nelson. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| Mr. Stager. Thank you, Chairman. So what happened at the Garth Brooks concert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| Okay. First of all, I'd like to say we're more disappointed than anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| We've made significant efforts in hiring over 500 people to work the show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| putting them through team training, through ID checking, through how the guides work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| what our policies are, what red box licenses look like, and spent numerous hours with all 500 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=566)|
| 0:09:34| You know, unfortunately, of the 80 compliance checks, seven of them failed to apply where we had trained them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=574)|
| 0:09:44| Now, I was in the room when those people were issued their citations, and, you know, quite frankly, I questioned them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=584)|
| 0:09:52| I mean, what happened? It was something we trained you to do. Why wasn't it applied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| And, you know, some note should be that it is the first event at Dillon Stadium of that magnitude where we served alcoholic beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=598)|
| 0:10:08| There were a lot of first-time employees. I mean, I chalked some of it up to stage fright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| When you've got that many people looking at you, looking to be served, some people freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| And, unfortunately, we, this being some of the first events they worked, we didn't have that knowledge in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| We've since re-engaged with the red box training, did more signage, did more training on what the actual repercussions to the individuals are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=626)|
| 0:10:40| relative to those citations, and we are endeavoring to bring them back for more training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=640)|
| 0:10:46| If you do fail and you do serve the minor, you're terminated from employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=646)|
| 0:10:54| You can no longer work for us. So those individuals would not be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| But for the staff that remained, we did offer more training and certainly went more in-depth with the red box in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=659)|
| 0:11:09| Let me pause right there. Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| Yes, my name is Michael McDonald. It's a 1713 Bear Run Drive in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| So there were seven violations at that concert evening, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| Okay. And what you said, seven, you said correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| Seven of 80 failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| Seven of 80. Okay. And how many employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| There were just under 500 employees serving alcohol that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| But of the seven failed, of the seven citations, was that one employee, two, three, four, five, seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=697)|
| 0:11:44| It was seven separate individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| Seven separate individuals out of 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=709)|
| 0:11:49| So they each got one citation apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| Mr. McDonald, can you tell us, I know Mr. Cheek was just telling us about the amendment to the server compliance plan that you all had submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=721)|
| 0:12:12| Can you talk to us a little bit about that, you know, specifically what you've got in the server compliance plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| and how or if it's different than what was going on during the Garth Brooks concert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=739)|
| 0:12:29| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| So a couple of things that we're doing differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| We did do the additional red box training with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| We have engaged with Top Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| We're going to have Ms. Pouncey review our plan and see what else we can add to it to make it a little more robust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| A significant amount of signage and then the training for the folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| We also will begin a incentive plan when Neyland opens back up for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| But as we work through this, we'll apply it to all the venues so that if you actually pass the checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| And we do checks on our own as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| We had a compliance check for the last football game with the independent outside agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| No one did fail that check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| Unfortunately, that was the first one they were able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| So again, that was our first opportunity to see how our internal piece would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| So between the incentive plan, the review of the policy, the current policy with Top Shelf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| and then the extra trainings of things we're looking to do to improve the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| And if there are suggestions, we're more than willing to talk about those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| Do you still have the different cups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=820)|
| 0:13:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| So we're doing the clear cups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| We still have the clear cup for beer, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=826)|
| 0:13:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| So we talked about last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=828)|
| 0:13:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=830)|
| 0:13:50| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=831)|
| 0:13:51| You?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=831)|
| 0:13:51| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| I have some questions and some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| I'm sure no one's surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| One of the questions I have is there is this, what is it called, the, where you can scan the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=836)|
| 0:14:07| Have you, and it says that the POS software or the portable ID scanners, have you considered getting that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| Well, there is no POS at the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| The infrastructure is not capable of supporting it currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| As far as the scanners go, generally speaking, what will happen during an event, they will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| between all the cell traffic and the wireless traffic, they will just take too long to go through or they won't go through at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=867)|
| 0:14:35| And that's why it was just simply mandatory ID for every transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| And then my concern is also being a new employee or having a first time isn't an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=881)|
| 0:14:49| I mean, I've had new jobs and I'm expected to perform legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| So that's a concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| The other piece is, and this is a little bit unrelated, is the two beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| I think I would feel more comfortable if there was some sort of ID check and also a one beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| What's been a concern to me is when you give two beers that size, by the time you drink one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| the other one's warm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| So it's probably being passed off to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| Or somebody's drinking warm beer, which I don't think that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| That's not our experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| You know, is there people that buy a beer for somebody that is of age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| I'm sure that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| But from a customer service perspective and the realization that the most, the wide majority of the people there are there to consume responsibly and enjoy the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=928)|
| 0:15:40| That's how we believe it's responsible to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| My concern is just them passing it off to somebody who's not of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=949)|
| 0:15:49| And we have the signage posted and we have compliance supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| We have the ushers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| We have the security staff at the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| There are, I don't remember the exact number, but there's over a thousand employees in the building on any given day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| They've all been addressed on how to look for the pass offs and what happens with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| Well, if 10% of them, like you said, there were 80 checks and about 7 didn't work out, that's about 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| If 10% of those people aren't trained or thinking about their training, that's a lot of eyes that aren't on who they're passing the beer off to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=973)|
| 0:16:22| So that's just my concern with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| I'd prefer if it was one beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| Ms. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| So of the seven citations that were given, you said that you were in the room with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| How many of those seven employees stated that they actually looked at the ID and they missed it versus those who were so busy that they didn't look at them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=997)|
| 0:16:46| In every instance, the employee requested the ID and looked at it, and that's actually in the report as well from the KBD and the TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1006)|
| 0:16:57| So they did request the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| They looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| For whatever reason, they just didn't read the birth date or didn't acknowledge the date of the 98 date or whatever it was, the November 16th, 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1020)|
| 0:17:12| Every one of them, to a fault, asked for the ID and looked at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| You know, the one woman I spoke to didn't have her glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| You know, I don't know how somebody thinks they're going to do this job without wearing their glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| You know, another woman just didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| She didn't have an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| You know, I don't think any of them were malicious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| You know, it was just something they failed to apply the training that we put forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| So do you have Post-it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| Since we talk about they failed to kind of connect that date, that particular date that the license should state that would make the person eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1060)|
| 0:17:50| Is that Post-it anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| It's Post-it in every stand and every point of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| We also have our alcohol compliance team go around and have them reiterate the date to them again at every location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| So it is a check-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| There's large posters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| There's posters in every stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| They have the ID books, and then it's spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| It's verbally communicated to them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| So on any given day, they're reminded at least three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1100)|
| 0:18:20| And so we understand with human performance that human errors are going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| So I think, you know, as Councilwoman Singh pointed out, there's probability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| And of course we know that employees are not going to do that intentionally, but we know that people will intentionally purchase more than one beverage to pass off to someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1110)|
| 0:18:40| There's a probability of that happening as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| At this point, my concern is that you have seven individuals who got citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1122)|
| 0:18:50| What we don't know is the probability of how many people that they actually sold, additional people they sold beverages, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1130)|
| 0:18:57| alcoholic beverages to that were not caught in the citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| And so we understand that that was a huge crowd for that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| But, again, employees have to be on point every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| So whether, of course, not intentional, but they have to be more focused as it relates to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| I don't know if you guys understand the conversation that was had by this body even to get to the point where we were in agreement with the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1157)|
| 0:19:26| So it sounds like you've put a lot of steps in place to help them be successful, but we still have that percentage there that were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1166)|
| 0:19:38| There's going to be human error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| To be clear, the citations have nothing to do with pass-offs or minors getting actually served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| What we have done here, though, is for the individuals that produce the ID, okay, we just need to get them to apply that training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1187)|
| 0:20:00| And, you know, as I said, it was a significant effort by TABC and the Knoxville Police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| I mean, 80 shops is a pretty significant undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| And the one thing it did do, it certainly drove home the fact that there's personal liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| I mean, it didn't go unnoticed with our staff that the reality of it is you better pay attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| because there's repercussions for you personally as well as the corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| So I think that actually will help moving forward because, believe me, that word spread very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| Was that reiterated prior to the event with the staff that here are the repercussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| here are the things that will happen if you were to not catch that ID date and sell to someone underage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1237)|
| 0:20:47| I'm sorry, can you say that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Was that stressed prior to the citations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| During the training, we told them that in the state of Tennessee there were personal consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| I think when you see your fellow employees actually walk out with the citation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| and know they're no longer working there and then have a court date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| I think that really drove home the fact that, hey, this is real and we better pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| And did I hear you correctly to state that you hired 500 employees for this event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| It was in the neighborhood of 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| We continued to hire really up until a week before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| We were doing trainings up until a couple of nights before the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| We continue to hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| Mr. Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Just a little bit of a follow-up to the questions that have been asked on either side of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| and maybe Mr. Maples might want to address this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| The rest of the protocol that you had explained to us when we approved all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| had to do with the follow-up in the stadium, making sure there was not pass-offs to other people that were underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1310)|
| 0:21:58| or people who were visibly inebriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| And I just wondered what, if anything, occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| And then the last part of that has to do with the follow-up for rides home, Uber, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| We did have the designated driver program in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| I don't know the particulars of the security specifics of the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| To my knowledge, it was nothing egregious that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| So there was no, you know, it was actually a pretty mellow crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| It was more of a date night kind of thing than anything else, and it was actually a pretty mellow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1350)|
| 0:22:38| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Okay, Ms. Rauner, do you have another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Yeah, I just was going to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| So I talked to somebody who worked in a booth and I guess supervised some staff in two different booths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Because my understanding is that some of them are paid staff and that some of them are volunteers for nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1372)|
| 0:23:00| We do have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| So there are employees and there are also nonprofit groups throughout the area that we use, church groups, schools, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| All of them go through the exact same training, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| So one of the things that was brought to my attention, they did not have one of the violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| They said they saw the ideas that were-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| And they were like, nope, and turned it back around and said nothing for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| But I questioned them because somebody else brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| So the employee serving the beer or the volunteer serving the beer is checking the ID, taking the money, and serving and pouring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1411)|
| 0:23:42| In this instance of Garth Brookshow, in many places we tried to have somebody actually pouring the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| In some cases, the infrastructure or facility just doesn't allow us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1428)|
| 0:23:55| But there are many places where we had people actually pouring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| I know there were some singular locations on the field as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| The field is tough for us to get space on the floor for shows of that size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| So we had really one big stand in the back of the audience, and then we had just individuals kind of lining up the sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1449)|
| 0:24:19| just really due to the space and equipment more than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| So a follow-up question to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| I know there's been some questions about passing off and stuff, but other venues give wristbands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| I've been to other sporting venues here in town where you get wristbands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| And, therefore, that helps with that issue as well, and I think that's the intent of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| So when the folks working out in the stands see that somebody has a beverage without a wristband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1483)|
| 0:24:53| then they know that that's been a pass-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| But have you guys considered, for ID purposes, to do wristbands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| And do you do that in any of your other venues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| We have in the past, and it really leads to a false sense of security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| A wristband can be passed off to somebody else, and our policy is still point of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| So regardless of whether they had a wristband or not, we would still want a mandatory ID at the point of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| So we've elected not to go the wristbanding route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| So for Lindsay Nelson Stadium, we need another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| My impression from what I heard from people who attended Garth Brooks was that it was not date night calm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1530)|
| 0:25:39| I heard a lot of stories of people falling down steps and lots of vomit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| And, you know, I read in the paper that there wasn't an uptick in drunk driving charges or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| But, as I said, I was not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| But it sounds like there was a wilder atmosphere, so that's a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| The other thing is Metro Drug Coalition has material available for education for how-to card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| and you've not availed yourself of those resources yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| When I did inquire that, I was told it was no longer available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| So that's why I would have availed myself of it, but I was told it was no longer available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| You know, and as far as the cloud goes, I mean, I guess you can speak to her afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| Deb Krause is right back here with MDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| You can speak to her tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| We will be more than happy to look at it, but I was told it wasn't available when I asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1588)|
| 0:26:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| You can talk to her after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| I'll make a motion to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1606)|

| 0:26:57| Maybe it wasn't the DVD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| That might have been what was no longer available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd293191217?start=1622)|
