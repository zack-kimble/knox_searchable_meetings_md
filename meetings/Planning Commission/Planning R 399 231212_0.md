| 0:01:00| going to make it to the agenda review or to the Thursday meeting please respond we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=60)|
| 0:01:05| having challenges getting responses back so it just helps staff plan if we'll all respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=65)|
| 0:01:13| At this time I'll turn it over to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=73)|
| 0:01:17| Thank you Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=77)|
| 0:01:19| I just have a few updates that I wanted to share with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| They're mainly project updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| So advanced NOCs hopefully you all have seen the growth policy coordinating committee has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| been meeting they've had two meetings so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| They have another meeting coming up on Tuesday December 19th at 5 p.m. and the main assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=92)|
| 0:01:40| Committee members at that time will not be taking a vote but they will continue to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| public comments and we'll keep you all posted when the next meeting where they will be voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| Will be scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| We have updated our FAQs on the advanced NOCs website so I encourage you all to take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| They do include questions that have come in over the last few weeks related to the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| policy plan and we've tried to clarify for the for the public what the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=122)|
| 0:02:10| plan is what it means and how it relates to the new comprehensive land use and transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=130)|
| 0:02:16| plan that hopefully you all will be considering after the new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=136)|
| 0:02:23| The mobility plan 2050 update is now underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| Staff shared a survey with all of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| I hope you all took a couple minutes to take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| It'll remain live for a little bit longer here and we also have an interactive web map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| where you can add comments directly to the map by zooming into the areas you can even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| get down to the street level or even specific intersections so encourage you to take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| It's at nocsmobility.org backslash feedback and if you all would like for me to I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| send you out a link to that directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| We have a new project that we've just recently kicked off at the city's office of sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| It's called breathe and it stands for building resilience emissions accounting tactics for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| a healthier environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| This project is funded by the EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| It's through the EPA's climate pollution reduction grant program and the focus of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| is identifying and evaluating activities that can reduce emissions across different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| sectors of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| Planning's role in this will focus on public outreach and community engagement with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| regional partners primarily through that TPO function that we administer and we will share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| that website once we have it updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| And that's it for my updates for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| We can go ahead and get into the agenda items if Lindsay is ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| I'm going to kick this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| So we're going to start off with agenda number five which is the city of Knoxville's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| amendments related to middle housing and as you all recall this item was postponed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| October to allow for additional public engagement which has happened by Ms. Cheryl Ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| She's led that on behalf of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| We've done some testing of the standards and we've also conducted a peer review and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| shared most of those findings with you all at the workshop that we held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| I'm grateful for those of you who were able to attend that and if those who were not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| hopefully you were able to watch the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| The body was also asked to, by city council, to consider the inclusion of RN1 in the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| middle housing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| So Lindsay will touch on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| And as requested by the commission, staff were asked to consider two zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| amendment proposals in conjunction with the city's proposal on middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| Those are items six and seven on the agenda submitted by Mr. Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| And after careful consideration again of those proposed amendments, staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| remains the same as what was presented in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| And so with that, I'll turn it over to Lindsay to walk you through the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| So as Amy said, this is the city of Knoxville's code amendments to enable middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| I think it has to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| This case was postponed at the October meeting, which gave us the opportunity for a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| in November, 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| That allowed us to provide context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| So to step back and give that thorough sort of what, why, and how overview, and also to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| unpack some of the major topics of discussion from the October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| Can y'all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| I don't know if this has anything to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| What about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| Is this okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| I feel like it creates static if we move it, but okay, I'll just move closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| So again, that workshop provided us the opportunity to give context and also to unpack some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=343)|
| 0:05:50| the concerns that were discussed in the October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| So I would encourage anybody who missed that workshop or the October meetings to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| that recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| For your reference and ease of access, Amy sent an extensive follow-up email on November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| So that's a date you may want to search in your inbox if you want to go back to some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| That was 11-17, and we can also reshare the recording of that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| We shared results of an extensive testing of the proposed code by planning staff, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| there was also a semester-long studio by the UT School of Architecture, which you may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| seen some of the images in the news lately, and that was really beneficial to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| We completed that peer review on other municipalities, and then the city of Knoxville shared the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| results of their really extensive community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| So here in agenda review, I'm just going to go through the code section again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| If some of y'all feel like you haven't heard enough about this, and some of you have probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| heard way too much, let Amy or myself know, and we'll provide those resources to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| sure you have all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| So just a real brief summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| So to enable middle housing, the concept, again, it's house-scale buildings in multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| units in walkable neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| So to enable middle housing, that successful kind of form of housing, it's compatible with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| houses on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| It's comprised of multiple smaller units, so multiple people can live there, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| located in neighborhoods where the infrastructure supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| This code takes that and, you know, contains dimensional and design standards, offers opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| for additional housing units, and it focuses on a specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| So the areas that are identified as ideal for middle housing are walkable, they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| smaller block lengths, a well-connected street network, nearby services, and then access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| to transit and lots with alleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| That's in comparison to neighborhoods that are typically not as appropriate for middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| housing that are more automobile-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| So drawing on that, we'll jump into the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| The initial section lays out the specific location where this is applicable, so responding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| to that ideal for middle housing concept, the area that's applicable is the traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| neighborhood residential land use area, the TDR, and that's called out on your map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| And then we have the zoning districts where this will apply, newly incorporating that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| R1 zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| The TDR, we found, is really appropriate and aligns with that ideal for middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| It's characterized by neighborhoods with a mix of detached and attached houses, sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| smaller lots, and alleys, and that's from our land use classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| So that's something that's already ingrained in our long-range planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| We're not creating a new zone for this or a new area, we're working with something that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| already ingrained in our systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| The code moves on to go through types, so those are definitions of each type of middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| There's emphasis on height, scale, and design features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| These definitions may differ from the base zoning code, but we've created a new definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| in section 2.3 that refers to this code, and so these types will apply only to middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| Section 4.6.B goes through the permitted uses, so those are based on zoning district, type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| and conformance to the standards that follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| Permitted use plus staff review, that aligns it with other precedents that we already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| for development review, the EN zoning district, the DKE, and the RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| So there is precedent for this type of planning staff review of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| We have standardized application forms and required supporting documentation, and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| have a real clear process for this review, similar to the systems we already have in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| We move to dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| So overall, these are standards are intended to encourage house scale buildings with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| lower perceived density, so their footprints and the overall buildings are similar to single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| family houses, and the building heights are not going to be taller than the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| Another major element here is that the standards will regulate the available housing type by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| lot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| So using the lot width instead of lot area means that these housing types can fit on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| existing lots without the need to combine lots and create really large lots that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| fit in with that streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| These would maintain the existing pattern of the street while accommodating additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| So there's a table, that's table 4-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| It establishes the dimensional standards by which the middle housing types are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| They supersede the dimensional standards in table 4-1 of the residential code, and these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| standards regulate minimum lot width, both with and without an alley, so that's acknowledging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| the possible need for a driveway access on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| Maximum building width and depth, setbacks, and height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| In this section, there are also definitions for building width and depth, so review of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| the building footprint is consistent across all of the types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| And then there are standards for dormer size and placement, and again, the aim here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| just to keep whatever is built in scale with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| We have parking standards in 4-6D, so where applicable, these will supersede the off-street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| parking requirements in table 11-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| In general, it's a one space per dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| Obviously, builders, developers, people working with these properties have the option to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| more should they want, but it's one space per dwelling unit minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| There are reduced landscape buffers, and then there are location criteria, one goal of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| is to ensure that the front yards aren't taken up by parking, and it just encourages parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=690)|
| 0:11:37| in the interior side or rear yards, and access by an alley when an operable alley is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| There are standards related to design, so front-facing garages and front yard circular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| driveways are not permitted, in general, because those are not garage and parking standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| that are seen already in these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| There are design standards as well, so the intention here is just, again, to generate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| new buildings that are similar in footprint, height, and placement to the context, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| allow for flexibility in design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| Some of the image examples on these slides, that is from the infill housing design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| and some of them are good and bad examples of how existing neighborhoods and how new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| construction can fit into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| The standards have to do with roof lines, with walls, we're trying to avoid large slots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| of siding, ensuring there are breaks in large massings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| There's a list of design elements from which applicants can choose, and again, these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| relatively simple, they're things that would most likely be included in a house anyways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| and then there are standards for orientation to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| There are standards for conversion in 4.6.F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| This is a tactic here to really incentivize and support use of our existing housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| in these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| Buildings can be converted to middle housing types via interior renovation or addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| and the available types would correspond with Table 4.3, so that's which type is permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| in which zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| There are relatively simple design standards there, typically associated with just placement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| of additions, with height and scale, and this was an element that was discussed pretty heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| in the Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| I did want to hit a few of those high points that we discussed at the workshop for folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| that weren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| One of the notes is this is already permitted in the base zoning via the special use process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| in several cases, however, it has fewer design guardrails and more parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| For example, in the RN1 or the RN2, a single-family house can already be converted to a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| through the special use process, but outside of the middle housing standards, they may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| be able to achieve this by, say, a two-story addition on a one-story house or other elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| that might be incompatible with the streetscape, and they'd have to add at least two parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| Another note to this is this is now officially supported by federal historic preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| policy, so the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, which is the federal group that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| oversees historic preservation policy, they really specifically reference this, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| say it's a way to increase density without demolition, including in historic neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| and historic districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| We've shared that paper with you all, but I'm happy to resend it if folks need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| Then we wanted to just note that contemporary building codes are in play here, so this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| intended to ensure safety, but also it may make conversion to three or more units a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| bit more challenging, so that may end up in the prevalence of duplexes in some instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| These were things that were discussed in the commission meeting, and we unpack it a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| little bit further in the workshop, so y'all can also review that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| 4.6.E, this is a section that we revised the title of, and I'll go to the revisions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| are made in a following slide, but these are the various guardrails around this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| so administrative variations, variances, and appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| Administrative variations can be granted by planning staff as part of the review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| so this is relief from certain standards based on existing conditions on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| so provided that the lot meets the intent, the other dimensional and design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| and is compatible in scale with the block face, there can be a 20% or up to a 20% reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| in lot width, corner side setbacks, and then also design standards with the aim to achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| a creative architectural design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| One element that we've revised in this after some legal input, and I'll let Amy and Tasha| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| unpack this further if folks have questions, but variances may be sought from the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| housing standards if a legal hardship exists, so this is an existing process, and that same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| process could be followed from the middle housing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| Then we have a note in there about appeals, so planning, this is a staff approval or denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| those could be appealed to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| Again, these are an existing process, so there are a good deal of guard rails here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| for both applicants and community members or folks with concerns, but one thing we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| wanted to note is that these middle housing standards are voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| Applicants can always opt to follow the base zoning in the special use review process too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| so the planning commission would see those as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| We have some associated minor amendments in the code, and I'm not going to run through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| all of these, but these are basically just minor text amendments to correct table numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| shift things around, and address the use matrix and principal use standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| Some of the revisions since the previous submission, these are in your case file in section 4.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| and it's the elements called out in red, and we can go through any of those that anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| has questions or concerns about, but really in general, these are relatively minor revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| to definitions, to some of the dimensional standards, and the parking, and a lot of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| is based on internal testing, so Samuel in our office went through and used SketchUp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| to model these forms on typical lots, and we identified some minor kind of design and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1032)|
| 0:17:20| dimensional and then parking things that needed to be modified associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| We have added back in the existing parking reduction for properties within a quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| mile of a transit route, so that is also a possibility there in the parking section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| Again, the capacity to apply for variances throughout the code is a revision since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| previous submission, and then we've provided a recommendation on incorporating the R and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| 1 zoning district pursuant to a request from city council, so we can go back to that chart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| We have recommended incorporating the R and 1 zoning district into duplexes here, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| I just note that duplexes are already permitted in the R and 1 zoning district via the special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| use process, and there is additional data on that request in the case file as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| So now, I and Amy, and we're all available to answer any sort of questions you guys might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1095)|
| 0:18:26| Why did you only allow for duplexes in R and 1, and how did you come up with that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1106)|
| 0:18:35| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Duplexes are already allowed, as Lindsay stated, in the R and 1 district, but they currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| require a special use, and this would eliminate the special use requirement if they were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| fall to middle housing types, and we felt like that would be appropriate first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| in that particular zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| Could you go back and explain to me within a quarter mile of that part of it, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1145)|
| 0:19:12| with the parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Yeah, so that is an existing element of the parking standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| I think it is section 11.4.B in the parking code citywide, and basically, there is a reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1158)|
| 0:19:35| in ... Is it 30% reduction in the parking that is required for a property if you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1175)|
| 0:19:42| within a quarter mile of a transit route?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| So that's something that we, in looking at how we had modified the parking standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| for these saying only one space per dwelling unit is required, at first, in working through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| that, we thought, well, that's a pretty substantial reduction as is, but hearing additional commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| and community feedback, we added that section back in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1202)|
| 0:20:11| So I have a question about just even the study that was sent about density without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| demolition, the federal historical preventative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| Does anything in this prevent someone from tearing down an existing single family dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1220)|
| 0:20:27| and building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| So no, the middle housing standards don't have anything new associated with demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| Properties that are in a neighborhood conservation or a historic overlay, demolition of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| houses or any buildings would be subject to historic zoning commission review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| Our city also has a provision in the building code for demolition review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1246)|
| 0:20:53| It's a 60-day demolition delay that may be enacted by the historic preservation planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| So right now, that's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| If a property has local historic significance but doesn't have historic zoning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| review, but these standards don't incorporate any additional demolition review in them right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| You sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Did you all look into accessible parking requirements any since our workshop, since that got brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| So I have some input, and I know Brian is here as well, but I do have some information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| that he had provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| So just as a framework, Commissioner Higgins had brought up the fact that accessible parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| is required when there are four units or more in a building and how that can create some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| conflicts or some additional challenges with site plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| You can see here our renderings, how some of the parking is laid out on these sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| can get a little complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| So and again, I'm not going to speak for you, Brian, I'll let you talk too, but there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| many variables within the building code that can change this, not necessarily requiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| more parking, but possibly exempting those spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| The building also says that where parking is provided, accessible parking spaces shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| So that means if a five-unit structure is built and it's required only three parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| spaces, then one of those spaces would need to be accessible if building code requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| So that's just to say we did explore it right now, that is something that would still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| required for buildings with that number of units, but there is some elements within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1349)|
| 0:22:37| building code that could change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| So is that to say that if you had four parking spaces required, like say you were building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| a quadplex and they had to be accessible, or there was an accessible space required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| it could count as one of those four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| I would defer to Mr. Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| We said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Yeah, he said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| I can't tell if you can hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| When this was brought up previously, and we were hearing it in our voting meeting, I asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1392)|
| 0:23:20| that there be some component of the plan that include a review for a year out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1400)|
| 0:23:29| Just because there's been so much attention to it, it would be fantastic to have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| codified that we come back and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| Is there anything, and I think Director Brooks, you answered my question, but I cannot remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| what you said at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| I'm not sure that I remember exactly what I said either during that workshop, but yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| that is our intent to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| If we need to put something more explicit, we're happy to do that, and that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| that can be made part of a motion if you all were to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| We also, in part of the peer review, we have a lot of examples of other municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| that provide that type of reporting, whether it's monthly, biannually, annually, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| So there are a lot of precedents for that type of reporting that we could use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| Lindsey, could we, could maybe walk us through that 30% reduction of parking and maybe by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1453)|
| 0:24:20| type and let's do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| It sounds nice, but I'm not sure how much effect it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1462)|
| 0:24:30| So on a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Yeah, I'll have Mr. Berry come up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1471)|
| 0:24:42| I'm Brian Berry with City Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Hey, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Hey, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Could you walk us through that by type and let's see how much parking is reduced by type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| based on the 30% reduction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| I'd have to do some quick math here on generally what we'd be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1496)|
| 0:25:03| On the table, the types there, if that helps you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| So two units, three, four, and we can go through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1506)|
| 0:25:36| So Lindsey, is there a table that's related to parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1536)|
| 0:25:50| So we don't have a table related to the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| Remind me, what was the parking requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| One space minimum per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| So if you take a duplex and multiply two times 0.30, that's 0.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1558)|
| 0:26:07| How would you apply that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| So if it's 1.5 or greater, it's rounded up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| And if it's 1.4 or less, it's rounded down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| So if it ends up being 1.4, it would be one parking space required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| And then on a triplex, we would just make sure we're doing the same thing here, times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1581)|
| 0:26:29| 0.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| So that would be 0.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| So you would get one reduction, one spot reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| And then on a fourplex, you would get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| I'll trust your math there and say it's 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| So rounding up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Lindsey, can you discuss what the legal hardships would be in order to go for a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1613)|
| 0:27:04| I'm Christina McGrath-Stillery with the City Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| So hardships are both defined in our zoning code and laid out very clearly in case law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| that's already been decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| So hardships have to relate, what I always say is they have to relate to the dirt itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| It has to be something like an irregularly shaped lot, the presence of a sinkhole, topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| issues, things along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| Something that forces you to design something a little bit differently because of the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| of the land itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| So what if they come in and say, well, the lot's too small?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| Well, we would generally not say that that is a hardship because that is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| is already a known characteristic of the property that may not be appropriate for this type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| And that's why if you look in the revised section about the variances, I'll read that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| first sentence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| The intent of Article 4.6 is to allow middle housing types which are in harmony with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| character of the surrounding neighborhood and will not be injurious to it or to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| public welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Therefore variances which would allow developments which are larger scale, allow for greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| density or otherwise are out of character with the surrounding neighborhood are discouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| unless there's legal hardship and all standards and requirements for variances are met, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| set forth in 16.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| So there is a discouragement of variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| And the reason why is because this particular use is a little bit more intense than say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| a single family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| So you might be able to do that on that small lot, but this may not be appropriate for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| small lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| So it has to do something with the physical nature of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Not the dimensional standards of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Could you come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Could you give us an example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| I've heard at BZA before where when you request something, they say, well, that's development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1735)|
| 0:29:03| driven is the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| And so that's not really a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| It seems like you could argue that no matter what thing you brought to BZA, that you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1747)|
| 0:29:15| say that's development driven if a single family home fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| But going to the middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| So I'm trying to think of what could be a hardship if they default to this is development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| driven and you can put a single family home on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| I think it would be very difficult for someone to come up with a hardship as defined by case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| law in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| You know, when you think about variances in general, it might be something like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| trying to add a garage on a property, but you have to put it within the side setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| because there's a sinkhole on the other side that started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| So that's an obvious hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| But you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| In terms of designing your own hardship is kind of how we phrase it, that is absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| something that probably would come up in any request to have this particular development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| along with a hardship request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| What if the lot, everything worked for, let's say, the number of units and the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1813)|
| 0:30:21| but in the parking, for whatever reason, you weren't able to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| Is there potential for a hardship there that isn't, what did you say, a designed hardship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1825)|
| 0:30:35| So there is a, I mean, they would have to make a hardship request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| They would have to show that there is some kind of hardship and that it was not designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Would, since it's not about the density or the number of units or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| would that be, I guess in that situation you could still say, well, a single family house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1854)|
| 0:31:01| wouldn't have this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| But if you meet all the standards to do missing middle and you just have this accessory issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1864)|
| 0:31:12| maybe it's not wide enough to do the parking required and you need a variance on the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| Do you think that the default would be, well, do a triplex or a single family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1877)|
| 0:31:24| Or do you think that there could be a hardship argued for the parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| So each piece of property is really different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| It would really be fact dependent on the case coming before the BDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| But I think generally that if it is design driven and scaling back the massing of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| building or the density would then allow for the parking, I think the applicant would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| a really high burden to try to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| I'm trying to find, so the quarter mile transit parking reduction, where in the missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| code does it link that to that production that's in another part of our existing code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| We did not link it directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| In the revisions we had in the proposal that was reviewed in October, we had specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| stated that that section does not apply and we've removed that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| So now that does apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| So the parking standards supersede all other parking standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Except for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| In the code, it says where applicable, the parking standards in 460 supersede off street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| parking requirements in table 11-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| So and then when it comes to a one spot per unit requirement, so Optico's recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1967)|
| 0:32:58| no more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| Having more than one is what they cited as a barrier to missing middle developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| So how did we arrive at one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=1988)|
| 0:33:21| So I might defer to my city colleagues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| I think after some discussion, not all of the recommendations were followed to the T| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2005)|
| 0:33:33| from Optico's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| I don't know if Ms. Ball would like to speak to the one space per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2014)|
| 0:33:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| Cheryl Ball, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| Our current code requires two parking spaces per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| It's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| And so our team, which involves half planning staff, half city staff, really wanted to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2034)|
| 0:34:02| a little more progressive than that, a little more supportive of not just what the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| of missing middle is, but the report that we received from Optico's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| And so we decided cutting that by half was a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| Just a quick reminder, I know that this stat is probably not embedded in your brain, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| it is in some of ours, but we've shared it with you a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| 40.8% of Knoxville households have a single person living in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2067)|
| 0:34:35| 40.8% have one person living in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| And so we felt like that also supported reducing the parking by 50%, basically, from what our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2080)|
| 0:34:48| standard code recommends, and coupling that with the Optico's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| And then we were really pleased to, most recently, as Lindsay said, go back and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2094)|
| 0:35:02| that additional 30% reduction, if you're within a quarter mile of transit, back into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2102)|
| 0:35:12| Does that help answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| That's the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| And then to follow up on that, from the other cities that have put in some missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| housing reforms, how many parking spots per unit have they been looking at doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2123)|
| 0:35:33| I would say it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| It's across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| And I think some municipalities that have done broader programs have removed all parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| requirements associated with these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| However, other municipalities have scaled it based on proximity to transit, proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| to corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| So I don't think I could give you a specific number on that, but the spreadsheet that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| shared that had the results of our peer review, it should have information on the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| reductions in the municipalities we researched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| So if there's a direction that you'd be interested in, we can definitely refer you to that kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| But in general, I think it differs depending on the municipality, the level of changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| they were looking to make, and then also locations within that city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| And then also I'll just add to that and keep in mind the level of transit service that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| those particular communities might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| Do we know if the city's ever looked at off-street parking inventory, for lack of a better word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| Has that ever been, like what is the capacity of our streets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| I think that's an excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| I'm not aware of any citywide study that's ever been undertaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| I know that there is a parking study, maybe for a smaller portion of the city, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| That they are currently going to be undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| I think my question is more of a procedural one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2222)|
| 0:37:11| When this was, so it might be for Tasha, but the, as this came through originally in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2231)|
| 0:37:19| in one form, and now it's significantly changed, adding R1, changing a lot of the things in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| I mean, when a motion is made, if there is a motion made, I mean, is it, I guess I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| thinking of like a zoning that came through and it's changed and there's an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| made and now it's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| You know, is it, since it was already in the system in the queue, if you will, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| or does it, if you made a motion, would it be for the one in October or is it the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| that would be in front of us today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| It's the one that's in front of us today, so you just, the motion that gets made covers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| all the new, everything that was invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| Subject to any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Or revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2287)|
| 0:38:21| Would there ever, excuse me, would there ever be a time where there would be no parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Parking Commission certainly has the opportunity and ability to incorporate that in the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| in the code amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| Well, you said other cities, some of them had parking restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| Some of them don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| What have been the obstacles on the cities that don't have parking restrictions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2326)|
| 0:38:54| What do you mean by obstacles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Have they had issues by not having parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Because I look at it that if I'm going to build a triplex, if there's a bunch of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| around, I might not put parking in, but if there wasn't any parking around, I wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| be able to sell it or rent it without parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| And I don't know if that's regulating or whether, I just think common sense would put the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2354)|
| 0:39:22| amount of parking spaces, but you all did it longer than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| Is there common sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| Well, I'll say, I think there hasn't been a lot of, because so many of these code amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2369)|
| 0:39:35| that other municipalities have made are relatively recent, there's not, what we found is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| there hasn't been a lot of data shared on that kind of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| So I don't know that we have a lot of info on obstacles that have been created, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| do think you bring up a very good point that anyone building these properties has the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| and opportunity, if the lot allows it, to provide more parking for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| I don't know, I just wanted to bring that up because that's the only thing that's puzzling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| I mean, I'm all for it, but you'd have so much more green space too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2405)|
| 0:40:13| You know, I mean, we can have roads ourselves to death, you know, but I, you know, parking's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| If you need it, you need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| But I just would love to have an idea of what would not require parking, somewhere down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| And I'd say you can kind of see the testing that was provided or completed by our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| and provided, you can see, you know, Samuel based these on standard dimensions, dimensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| that engineering uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| So you can see how these are laid out in the testing document, like what these parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| areas could look like as proposed currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| Rich, I go back to, I know I've referenced this a couple of times, so you're probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2454)|
| 0:41:05| tired of hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| The urban overlay zone in Nashville, Tennessee, they have no parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2466)|
| 0:41:15| And just on my observation, it looks like it works very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| And they only do that in the TDRs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| I wanted to kind of tag on to what Tim was saying that two things, one, what you're raising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2486)|
| 0:41:34| is why I want very much there to be, if this moves forward, a time period where we look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| at what worked, what didn't, you know, how do we keep making this the best that it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| And that could be an area where the parking gets assessed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| But it was at a Keep Knoxville Beautiful event a couple of months ago where there was someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2507)|
| 0:41:55| from their planning department or working on their zoning that was talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| removal of parking minimums and the effect in a positive way that that had brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| So I think there are a couple of examples just today that we've got, but I think being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| able to assess that after a period of time and really see what is happening now would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2538)|
| 0:42:26| If we already are reducing the parking requirements within a quarter mile of a public transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| I mean, I'm not a math whiz, admittedly, everybody, but the math I heard, you're essentially taking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2554)|
| 0:42:42| it's possible that you would be taking away a spot from an entire unit anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| So and I'm sorry if you've answered this, but within the quarter mile of public transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| I assume that the rationale is that those people can get to public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| So I guess why didn't we just remove the parking requirement and maybe this goes to Tim's point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| of the urban overlay within the quarter mile and then everybody else, I understand we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| I'm sorry if I'm like repeating everything, but I'm trying to just kind of tie a bow on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| We hadn't included that in our proposal, but again, that's something that is within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| planning commission's capacity to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| Another thing that I think would be good to do, maybe we do it Thursday, is inquire about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| the testing of these properties to see what were the biggest barriers because what I took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| from Opticos was parking is the biggest barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2614)|
| 0:43:49| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| Commissioner Adams had a couple of questions about another item that we didn't have on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| If you would still like to ask those questions, I was going to suggest that we move to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| It's item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| It's another ordinance amendment submitted by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| If that's okay, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| We have Ms. Liz Albertson here, so if you have any specific questions, I'm sure she'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| be able to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| We were not prepared for an actual presentation on this one, but Liz, do you want to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| up and just give a brief overview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| I'm Liz Albertson with the city of Knoxville, and I wanted to briefly go over the South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| Waterfront and form-based code amendments that are before you this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| If you remember previously, back in October, there were also some amendments that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2689)|
| 0:44:56| forward related to establishing standalone surface parking lot landscaping requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| in the form-based code district for the South Waterfront, as well as limiting variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| on transparency requirements for ground floor transparency also within these more commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| areas of the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| Those amendments were passed at the November 28 City Council meeting, so they're now adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2720)|
| 0:45:29| in part of the code, but this is the second round of revisions that are coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2729)|
| 0:45:35| This is changes to the level three alternative compliance review language for the form-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2735)|
| 0:45:42| code districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| Just to sort of remind everyone, I've handed out a summary of the process improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| for the South Waterfront area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| The city has been working technically since January of this year, 2023, to revise some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2754)|
| 0:46:07| things related to the Board of Zoning Appeals, particularly with the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| There had been a number of concerns from the community where people felt that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2773)|
| 0:46:20| were not made aware of some of the variances that were being applied for in the South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| So, to help meet some of those concerns in January of 2023, the signposting requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2786)|
| 0:46:34| for the Board of Zoning Appeals within the city was actually codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| That was a practice that had already been happening, but now it is part of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| noticing that's required for all of the form-based code districts, so both South Waterfront and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2804)|
| 0:46:53| Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| The advisory group that was established as well back in January of 2023, a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2815)|
| 0:47:03| was adopted by the city council asking for there to be an advisory group that studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| the South Waterfront and provide some recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| So, that group met approximately five times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| There were about 12 participating community members, and several actions have taken place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2836)|
| 0:47:24| because of the recommendations from that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| So, I just want to let you know that the work is not done with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| We are still continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| This will probably not be the last round of revisions you'll see before you, but we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| going to continue the work with a larger group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| So, right now, we have a group of about 12 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| The group, with the advisement of Councilman Smith, as well as some other community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2866)|
| 0:47:54| is expanding into more of an advocacy and advisory group that will continue looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| at development in the South Waterfront and making recommendations for how we can better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| improve that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| So, just wanted to let you know that these are the changes that are before you now, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| we feel like we're heading in a really great direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| So, if you have any questions, you know, particularly about these amendments, please let me know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| or the process overall, but I think this document that I've handed out will summarize sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| how we've gotten to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| That helps me understand how this complements what we're looking at for the meeting on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2911)|
| 0:48:38| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2918)|
| 0:48:45| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| Now we're going to move on to agenda item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| And we will cover this one, 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2935)|
| 0:49:07| This is a rezoning request from the Business and Technology Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| Wendy, can you pull your mic down a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| This is a rezoning request from Business and Technology Park with a technology overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| to planned residential up to 12 dwine units an acre with a technology overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| This was approved or recommended for approval last night at the TTCDA board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| It's 9.88 acres on Bob Gray Road and Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| The PR zone at 12 dwine units an acre is consistent with the MDRO land use classification in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| Northwest County Sector Plan, which allows consideration of up to 12 dwine units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| in the county's planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=2994)|

| 0:50:38| to planned residential and technology overlay in this area, and the PR zone at a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3038)|

| 0:51:18| So the staff recommendation is to approve the PR zone with up to 12 dwine units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| with one condition, requiring a sub-out to Parkway Heights, the subdivision to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| with the location and design to be approved by the Planning Commission during development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3090)|

| 0:51:36| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| I just have a question about the, it's not specific to this development, but it is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| general the road plan in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| Can you speak to what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| So there's no official plan, but there were presentations done by TDOT in I believe 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3116)|
| 0:52:05| talking about closing a lot of access points along Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| And so this road, the Odin Street connection, we asked them if they would be in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3129)|
| 0:52:16| closing that if a sub-out was provided, and TDOT said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3136)|
| 0:52:23| And I don't have a specific answer to that question, but I do know that a TDOT representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| presented this morning that they are looking at Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3149)|

| 0:53:04| the subdivision regulations and two requests for alternative design standards that require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Can I do one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| Sure, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| Can I back up on this last one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| My little journal trap didn't quite catch up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| Sorry, I didn't mean to move too quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| No, you didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Just the more I thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| So that access to Pellissippi Parkway is not great, and I get that, and I understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3202)|
| 0:53:30| benefit of requiring the sub street from the 12 to the new 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| It makes total sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| As you look at the access on Bob Gray for the new 12, there's not a whole lot of frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3217)|
| 0:53:45| there, and you've got the bridge abutment, and so there's not going to be a huge opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| for improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| And so my question is, if the developer for the new 12 is saddled with having to solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3232)|
| 0:53:59| for the old 12's traffic, would it then limit the ability to develop the new 12 because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3239)|
| 0:54:07| of the traffic of the old 12, because their access is taken away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| And who would contribute, because the developer is long gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| This is an old HOA, and they're obviously not going to be able to contribute financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| to any improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| So that can be a little bit challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| So I'm just curious if there's too much loaded on that one piece that it just can't absorb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3268)|
| 0:54:40| how do we deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Steve, do you have a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| That's a point I brought up when we were talking about the stub out, is the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| If the traffic from the existing subdivision trips a turn lane, I think Knox County would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| be forced to participate and assist the developer in installing turn lanes or whatever road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3294)|
| 0:55:01| improvements would be necessary for their access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| There's also access to the west from existing subdivision, I think we would look at is when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| we get into the development plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| That's a great question, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3312)|

| 0:56:20| western parcel in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3380)|

| 0:56:27| Here is an aerial view of the property, as you can see it's surrounded by single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3387)|

| 0:57:02| This concept plan includes a variance request for reduction of the minimum intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| separation from Nathan's Cove Way and 2 Shirley Way from 300 feet to 125 feet, as marked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3426)|

| 0:57:18| It also requests for two alternative design standards, reduction of the minimum right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| of way width and reduction of the minimum pavement width of the private right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3443)|
| 0:57:32| Staff recommends approval of the variance because of the topography and location of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| the property with respect to the adjacent streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| The entire property is less than 300 feet from Shirley Way, so it's impossible to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| the requirement along Lonas Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| It is equally challenging to provide access from Kim Wat Drive because of great changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3469)|
| 0:57:56| and potential site distance issue due to the horizontal curve of Kim Wat Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3476)|

| 0:58:31| We are recommending approval of the alternative design standards as supported by engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| One of the conditions of the concept plan approval is certifying the site distance before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3517)|

| 0:59:08| Question for me is, but for the topography and the frontage issue, I guess, would we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| otherwise require them to connect to Kim Wat Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| If Kim Wat Drive had a better site distance and no topographical issue, the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3558)|
| 0:59:25| and the developer could likely look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| However, this came up and discussed and everyone thought that it's better to have access from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3568)|
| 0:59:35| Lonas Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Shirley Way is also a local street and it has relatively low traffic volume and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3576)|
| 0:59:45| subdivision of 14 lot will likely have low traffic volume, so no left-turn conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| are anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| Beside the left-turn conflict, I think there are adequate site distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| The engineer or the applicant has provided that, but the engineering department has requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| that they re-evaluate the site distance and that's why we're adding that as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3604)|

| 1:02:00| Here is an aerial image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| You can see that this is a heavily vegetated parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| There are existing wetlands, but the boundaries of the wetlands have not been determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| The plat identifies the wetland on the corner of the adjacent parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3730)|

| 1:02:20| for the whole parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| It is to be noted that the applicant has requested the Historic Zoning Commission for removal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| of the HD overlay from the entire property in October, but the HEC has denied the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3749)|
| 1:02:38| The applicant has revised the boundary for this rezoning application, so it does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| include the whole boundary, as I mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| Staff recommends the approval of the CA Zone and GC land use because it's compatible with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| the surrounding area, including the commercial uses nearby, subject to three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| Staff recommends to deny the removal of the HD overlay, as recommended by HGC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| The conditions include determining the wetland boundary and any disturbance on that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3786)|
| 1:03:12| would be subject to the Knox County Stormwater Ordinance, Section 262232.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| We're also recommending providing a 50-feet buffer along the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| This is consistent with the John Xavier Highway Corridor Studies recommendation for a 50-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| buffer of tree preservation and replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3810)|

| 1:03:43| I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| Sonal, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3829)|
| 1:03:55| Can you go back to the map that shows the—I'll back another one, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3835)|
| 1:04:05| My question is about the area that's sort of a long rectangle that's not being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3845)|
| 1:04:12| Yes, so that is not part of this rezoning application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| I think there are wetlands, it's going to be difficult to develop anyway, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3858)|
| 1:04:26| the boundary of the wetland has never been determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| So they may be able to develop some of it, but that is not part of this rezoning application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| Samuel, is the intent of the square footage for the sign for an advertising sign or business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| I think it's—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| Advertising to me says billboard, business is for the business, so I don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3890)|
| 1:04:57| the intent there is for the wording of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| I actually copied the language from the Scenic Highway and Parkway Regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| It just says there are advertising signs, but I'm not aware that it has been specified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| However, the John Sabir Highway Corridor Study has some recommendation for signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| It discourages any pole sign or any billboard, but we have not added those conditions in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| So are you saying add on-premise signage instead of—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3924)|
| 1:05:31| Yes, I think it should just say all signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| On-premise signage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| Because advertising to me indicates a billboard-type sign, not a business sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3936)|
| 1:05:45| Did you hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| You kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| He was talking to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| We've still got two weeks until Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Yeah, that was one of my most shiny moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| Well, replay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| Codes and I think that you ought to specifically say that the signage is for on-premise signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| just so codes won't have to make a determination down the road as to what type of signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3967)|
| 1:06:14| You guys can go back to your regularly scheduled—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3974)|
| 1:06:22| I was just going to ask Lindsay if she could talk about the impact to the property of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| historic zoning overlay remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| So the Historic Zoning Commission is charged with reviewing how the placement or the removal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3991)|
| 1:06:38| of a historic zoning overlay would affect the integrity of the overall site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| And the concept of integrity is a preservation thing that involves setting as well as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4003)|
| 1:06:50| overall property, not just the Ramsey House itself, which is pretty far away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| So in October 2023, the Knox County Historic Zoning Commission determined that removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4015)|
| 1:07:01| the historic zoning overlay from the entire parcel would have an adverse effect on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| Ramsey House property because the Ramsey House property doesn't just incorporate that house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| but it incorporates the historic setting around it, which includes those wetlands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| areas, the woods, everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| A follow-up question on the historical overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| I guess the way you worded that, and I certainly wasn't in that meeting, but they're opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| to removing it from the entire parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| Because, I mean, as I'm looking at it, certainly that backstrip behind it should stay in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| Can you pull up that aerial of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| I mean, if we're talking about historical, I mean, I see a bunch of trailers on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| upper portion, right down the street, and a lot of commercial uses, some sort of apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| down on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| And a Dollar General is certainly not historical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| But I'm just posing the question, I mean, would it even be a consideration to not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4080)|
| 1:08:06| the historical overlay on the front part, but keep it on the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| So that is the applicant's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| When he came to the Historic Zoning Commission, the map that Samuel has that shows that L| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| shape, he requested to remove it from the entire one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| Then based on the input from the Historic Zoning Commission, he has removed that section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| and submitted this request to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| Okay, so who would have jurisdiction over that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| The Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| Do you know what the historical society would feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| Well, I can definitely provide you their discussion, because they did kind of go into it in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4121)|
| 1:08:50| I think the discussion really just focused on removing it from the entire parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| And so that includes the parcel that fronts John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| Yeah, I mean, I'd like to look at the discussion part, if you could email that, if it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4139)|
| 1:09:05| Just out of curiosity anyway, because it kind of makes sense to me that everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| on John Sevier is just commercial, but it makes sense to me that the historical overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| needs to remain on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| But I guess it just wasn't presented to the historical ... The application wasn't made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| And I'd just note, on the historic zoning end, historic zoning on a property doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| preclude development of any kind, and it doesn't regulate use in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| So even with the historic zoning overlay on the property, the developer could build something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| They would just go through a design review-related process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| Wasn't there something in the case file that sort of spoke to what you just said, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| it's really there ... The historic overlay is really there as a flag for groups like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| the Planning Commission to take note as they're making decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| Yeah, I would agree with that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| That would be one reason that I would be okay leaving it there, just to remain cognizant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4199)|
| 1:10:06| of what is around that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| Yeah, and I'm totally okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| I guess my question is, to reiterate, it doesn't restrict height or ... I guess we were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| about signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| Is that having anything to do with historical overlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| No, that would adhere to the base zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| The design guidelines for this property are the basic overarching standards for historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4227)|
| 1:10:33| preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| They're called the Secretary of the Interior Standards for Rehab, and basically the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| is just for what is built on the site to be compatible and not detract from the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| Lindsay, quick question, because I was at the historic meeting when this was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4246)|
| 1:10:55| So, do they just make a recommendation to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| Yes, they are not a ruling body on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| The Planning Commission is the one who makes the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| They make a recommendation to you guys on how it may or may not affect the historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| I may have missed or misunderstood this, but did they make a recommendation on this version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| They made a recommendation on that version that's on the screen right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| On my point of clarification, you were asking about the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| That's not guided by the HCC, but in this case, it's in the Governor John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4289)|
| 1:11:34| Scenic Corridor by the state, it's designated by the state, and that does have a 35-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| height prohibition, so that's where that height comes into play, is from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| Does all of them appear the same height?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| I'd have to double-check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| Pull it up real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| Help me understand that, because what does that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| It sounds like it would protect certain things, but I see that junkyard that just popped up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4319)|
| 1:12:06| about three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| Does the scenic highway not prevent something like that from occurring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| It does have a prohibition on those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| It looks like the Governor John Sevier Highway was designated a scenic highway in 1971 from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4338)|
| 1:12:24| the intersection of Alcoa Highway to the intersection of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4344)|
| 1:12:31| So this is not the scenic part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| I'm pretty sure it goes all the way to Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| It might be a different line in the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| Oh, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| In 1982, that designated the entire length of John Sevier Highway as part of the parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4365)|
| 1:12:52| system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| Yeah, we do have the scenic highway map layer in KGIS, and looking at it now, it does look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4373)|
| 1:12:59| like the entire thing is included in that buffer area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| So what protections does a scenic highway provide if we have junkyards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| I couldn't speak to how that got permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| I'm not sure if maybe it just didn't get permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| I would refer to my county colleagues...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| Or if it's been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| No, it hasn't been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| Oh, gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| It's a scenic junkyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| That includes the ones that we've had identified to review today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4402)|
| 1:13:36| Are there any other ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| I think we're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231212?start=4427)|
