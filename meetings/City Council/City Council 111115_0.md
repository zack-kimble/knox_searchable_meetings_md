| 0:01:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=74)|
| 0:01:14| Been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=74)|

| 0:01:23| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=83)|
| 0:01:27| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| Yes, item 12Q.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| Would like to postpone to the next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=92)|
| 0:01:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=98)|
| 0:01:41| Been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=105)|
| 0:01:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| Mayor, was there anyone here to speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| I don't think anyone was here to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| Is there anyone here to speak on that particular motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| Yes, sir, if you could come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| My name is Richard Cadmus, C-A-D-M-U-S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| I live at 8867 Happy Howell Road in Lenore City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=130)|
| 0:02:17| I own property on Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| Next to the Hatcher Hill property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| And I didn't hear exactly what's being postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| Was that Q?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| Yes, 12Q.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| Do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| I have the agenda here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| I came from Annapolis, Maryland to make this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| so I guess there was no need for that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| Well, I thought that you had to make that trip since it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| going to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Well, I live here, but I was working up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| So I would like to say that it seems odd that you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=175)|
| 0:03:04| postpone this, but not postpone the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| variances until this was passed by the city council, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| I asked the Board of Zoning Appeals to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| but they refused to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| So I guess if it's being postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| it's being postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| Mr. Mayor, yes, Mr. Hill asked that this be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| There is some variances that he's going before to ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| And if he does not get those variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| he wants to leave the zoning the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| But if he's able to do that, then he'd like to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| So we're kind of getting a cart before the horse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| So what he would like to do is postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| until he does go before the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| to ask for those variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| Well, that's exactly what I asked for at the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| of Zoning Appeals, but nobody was interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| So it could have saved me a trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Yes, Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| The gentleman made the trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| I mean, I don't have any objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| to us hearing what he has to say about this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| I mean, I certainly feel that he made a real effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| to get to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| And well, do you want to make it treated as public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| Mr. Swanson, how should we deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| If he wanted to sign up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| he certainly can sign up for public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| and say whatever he wants to say for five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Would you be comfortable with that, Mr. Camus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| That doesn't change the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=286)|
| 0:04:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| We've already voted on the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| but you still would have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| to address it at the public forum if you would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| Come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| And I'm assuming I would have the same opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| to address it whenever it's postponed to, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=304)|
| 0:05:04| OK, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| Item 12A has been before us several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| This is the pension board issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| I know that Councilman De La Voke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| was concerned that some edits had not been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| and there was a specific reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| The pension board has seven members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| Four of those members will be new in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| And so consequently, I do know after speaking with Mike Cherry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| that there is going to be an examination of their rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| They may be changing some things that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| I'm not thrilled to be proposing a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| That's a very tedious process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| It's an expensive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| So what I would like to do is give the new pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| board that takes office in January an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| to look at some things that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| And one of those things has to do with this majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| of the board, not majority of the members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| So with all of that in mind and the indulgence of Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| I would like to postpone this issue until January 24, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| I will be going to the January pension board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| and addressing the new membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| And if by January 24, I don't feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| that they will be acting without this prompt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| then I will ask for no further postponements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| Been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| Are there any items requested to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| Any consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=417)|
| 0:06:57| Under the mayor's report, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| we want to congratulate the incoming mayor and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| As you all know, last week marked the culmination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| of a long election season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| And I want to congratulate our mayor-elect, Madeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| Rojaro, and the four new council members who will be joining us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| in about a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| Mark Caffin, who will represent the Fifth District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| Finbar Sanders, George Wallace, and Marshall Starr,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| who serve at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| And George Wallace and Marshall Starr are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| If you care to come and address us, you're more than welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| If you don't care, you're also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| Thank you for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| Also, we have a new off-leash dog park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| which opens November 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| And Councilman Pavlis may have a little more to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| I think I'll just let him talk about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| since that's in his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| And then also, we'd like to recognize the Boy Scout Troop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| 451, which is in attendance tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| And they are from Cumberland Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| And their leader is Jeff Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| And if they're here, you're welcome to come down and speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| to us, if you would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| If you have a representative that would like to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| You can identify yourself and your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| My name is Jeff Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| I live at 6754 Timber Run Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| I don't have any prepared remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| I just thank you for allowing us the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| These scouts are working on a communications merit badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| And one of the requirements is they attend a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| And they're coming down to learn how basically our democracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| and our government works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| We're glad that you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| Also, let me recognize Deputy Chief Holliday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| This is his first meeting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| And let's give him a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=544)|
| 0:09:12| All right, are there any reports of counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Councilman Pavley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Yeah, I'd just like to comment on the dog park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| This has been a long time coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| And first off, I'd like to thank Randy and Jenny Boyd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| for their generosity to not only the city but the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| in funding these dog parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| I mean, I've paid particular interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| to the parks around the area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| And they're so well used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| And I can't tell you how excited the folks in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| are to have this dog park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| But not only that, but Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| redid the running track there in conjunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| with this renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| So my team South is really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| Of course, it's open throughout Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| And everyone is welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| And I hope that there'll be a good turnout when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| we cut the ribbon this Thursday for Randy and Jenny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| just to talk about their generosity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| And it's really a big deal for South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| But one other thing, I noticed in the paper today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| we've got a great opportunity to help a young lady here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| that goes to Bearden High School, Miss Sarah Bird,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| for the license plate, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| for the arts license plate that's being designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| I think it's kind of unique that she's the only teenager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| really the non-professional type person that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| made the top 10 entries here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| And you can go to stateyourplate.org| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| and cast your vote for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| And I think it would be a real honor for a Knoxvillean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| particularly a fine young lady like Sarah Bird,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| to have this honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| So I urge everybody in Knoxville, let's go vote for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| Let her get that honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| What was the time of that ribbon cutting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| It is at 4.30 this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=663)|
| 0:11:11| Councilman DelaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| I wanted to report to this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| that there was a meeting in Fountain City last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| And it was heavily attended because there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| is a great deal of controversy going on in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| And there certainly are sincere people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| on both sides of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| But it concerns this establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| of a crematorium in an existing funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| And one of the issues that has been aired and discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| is the lack of any effort to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| this in our zoning codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| There was a time when crematoria, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| was kind of an unusual use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| But that is a growing use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| And I think this council is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| to have to address that in a way that at least there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| is some type of use on review or other approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| before a permit can be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| Because the community was most upset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| most upset about the lack of any process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| to have their voice heard before permits were issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| And I assume that the permits were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| issued in accordance with law and the standards we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| But frankly, there was a lack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| There was no real public notice that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| were issuing a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| The Knox County Air Pollution Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| is the only one that regulates the environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| And there were concerns about emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| And apparently, there wasn't, unlike the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| when TDEC does things, there wasn't a 30-day notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| and comment period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| So there was a lot of frustration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| that the community was faced with a fait accompli,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| that they weren't sure they wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| or at least some people weren't sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| But I credit everyone on both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| with the sincerity and good intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| But it was terribly frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| And I think it reveals a gap in our zoning ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| that we don't regulate crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| There was some argument that should be an industrial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| because it's an incinerator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| And I don't mean to belabor that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| But I think it's incumbent on this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| to probably have a resolution maybe at our next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| where we ask MPC to take a look at the zoning dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| with this so that, at least from the city's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| we can say that we've addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| I think that this particular project is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| underway physically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| But I think it's the first and what we may see more of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| And just for the benefit of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| I think it's important to realize that the traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| funeral home was a place that was somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| like a church chapel that you went and visited with family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| to grieve over the loss of someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| And this new use changes at least the perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| And I'm not going to argue for or against it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| But just that it was terribly disturbing to that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| which this was an office one zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| It was near residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| It's near the Fountain City Lake where there's recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| It was a concern that there was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| that they perceived to be at least an industrial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| with emissions right in the heart of that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| and that there was no place where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| their concerns were voiced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| So I think we need to find a way to make that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| for communities to be heard and not to be frustrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| by something coming out of a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| just a simple permit issuance approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| And I think I've said enough, but that's a serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| And there was over 100 people there that were well-behaved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| but mostly very excited about what was happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| in both positive and negative ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| And we need to have our zoning laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| give them a place to address these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| before they get rolling down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| I want to reiterate what Councilman Pavlis had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| It was a well-behaved group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| I was there last night also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| and we do need to look at ways in which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| I'm Delavoping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| It's the other Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| You were there in spirit, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| But a couple of things, Mr. Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| I'd like to bring up just as a briefing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| I had asked Dr. Lyons if he could give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| an update on Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| We've read in the papers lately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| what the state is considering doing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| And so I had asked him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| if he would give us a briefing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| And then also the other thing that's been in the newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| that concerns some of us is the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| or what may be happening with Kimberly-Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| And so if Dr. Lyons could just give us a briefing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| on both those, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Sure, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| First, on Lakeshore, as was noted in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| we were told, and we got a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| the administration was called from the folks at the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| from the governor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| that they would be closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| the Mental Health Institute at Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| At least that's in the process of being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| You may have noted today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| it's in the budget procedures that the state is undergoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| where a presentation was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| where the department had recommended its closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| So we have to anticipate right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| that there's a strong likelihood of that's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| and that those patients would then be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| arrangements would be made for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| to be dealt with in other ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| probably through private providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| And that hasn't, we weren't given any details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| and I don't know that any of those details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| have yet been reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| Obviously, there are people who need help there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| that will have to be, those needs will have to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| We also, there are a number of employees there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| and that's obviously a concern as well in excess of 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| So what we were notified, and then finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| of course, is the matter of the land itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| and its present use and what might happen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| And I know there's a lot of interest in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| and we have heard some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1014)|
| 0:16:54| had some questions about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| The, we have had no understanding or no word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| or no discussion with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| other than that they are likely to close the institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| Nothing on transferring the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| which would still be in their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| We have a long-term agreement that was a 1999 agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| that specified other properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| their conveyance to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| responsibility for knocking down buildings and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| that we've been in the process of implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| This, I think it's safe to say that in that agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| there was the possibility of other land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| being made available was addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| and that would be dealt with probably through a sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| if the state wanted to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| and the city agreed to purchase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| Other than that, that's pretty well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| the status of it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| And we're obviously quite interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| in what happens with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| And I think there's a lot of interest in the ultimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| not only outcome relative to the people involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| but also to the land for the future of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| On the Kimberly-Clark, we also had a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| I was in a meeting along with Deputy to the Mayor Martin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| with folks from Kimberly-Clark a couple of weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| where they told us that they were in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| looking to move from their facility in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| The good news is they were looking to stay in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| The reasons for their moving were many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| One of them, the thing that got them started looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| was that they're losing control of the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| they presently use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| They leased that many of the spaces from TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| and TVA is gonna need those spaces back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| But they made it clear to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| this was not just about parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| This was a matter of their real estate plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| their overall approach to real estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| where the building they're most comfortable in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| the fact that the building they're in now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| they would have to literally be a landlord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| to other entities and that's not the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| that Kimberly-Clark likes to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| and it's very challenging in and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| So we now, a bit of background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| we have discussed with them over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| really over the last five or six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| when we knew this was coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| discussed with them, with TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| is there any alternative garage site possibilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| We discussed with TVA the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| of a joint participation and possibly in a garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| at that end of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Unfortunately, those discussions have started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| and stopped a few times and then the last time they started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| they were stopped after the ash spill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| You may have heard something about they got their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| So I think there's a big case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| You've got the TVA towers and the Kimberly-Clark building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| There's not sufficient parking now for all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| That's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| It's certainly a concern to us and I know to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| But as you also know, finding, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| construction of garages is quite expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| So that's pretty much where we are on both those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| Are there any studies being looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| as far as any possible garages at that end of town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| There's nothing formal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| I'll have to say we've all looked at locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| that look like they might be suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| We had one, a couple in mind with TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| that we looked at, just by looked at, looked at the maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| looked at the ownership of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| Some of those have proven not to survive much of a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| But I think if there was the will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| there's probably a place to put a garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| on that end of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| Expenses notwithstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| Councilman DellaVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Yes, I don't want to prolong this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| but I was concerned about the first item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| you talked about, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| I saw that in the paper, but I'm troubled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| that when Lakeshore closes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| it has some of the most long-term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| mentally disturbed people that it treats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| And one of the possibilities is to be back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| where we were in the early 70s where we had people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| who needed really intensive care out on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| and either causing crime issues or homeless issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| And it's certainly going to be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| that's going to have an impact on this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| Do you have any idea of the number of patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| that are instituted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Yes, there are about 98 patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Hence, you can see the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| We have over 300 employees and 98 patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| And I think-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1255)|
| 0:20:55| The state was concerned about the cost, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| Yes, from the state point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| And they were under instructions to reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| their budgets in each department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| However, your point is right on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| We have people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| We are very concerned on a human basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| and on the basis that you address of the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| on the city of folks not being left without treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| just to wander the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| We certainly hope that that's not what the outcome will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| And obviously are concerned with what the ultimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| transition to care is that's provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Certainly, we've been told that it wasn't just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| to abandon the care, but to transfer it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| to be delivered in a more efficient manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| But I hope you'll keep us informed on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| because that's significant to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| Mr. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1304)|

| 0:29:14| Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Yes, is Becky Wade here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| Yes, she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1757)|
| 0:29:17| Okay, I'd like to ask her a little bit about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| because one of the pieces of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| in the agenda information sheet was that these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| on a federal level are expiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| and we're going to start seeing, I guess, difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| as HUD has less and less money to pass out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| I realize that we have loans outstanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| and that we are managing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Could you tell us a little bit about the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| and what you see coming down the pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| as we enter an era of restricted funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1787)|
| 0:29:59| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Maybe try out Mr. King's mic there, see if that's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1801)|
| 0:30:13| That's not better either, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| How about the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| Yes, you're down to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| See, the funds are already affecting the microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| We're already losing things, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| The item before you was contained in our annual action plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| for this current year, and it is CDBG funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| that are granted to the city on an annual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| through formula funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| These funds are sort of taking over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| from some of the stimulus money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| that we received a few years ago in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| These were specifically homeless prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| and rapid rehousing funds through ERA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| that the city received, and part of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| were granted to CAC to operate this case management project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| This provides case managers in the KCDC high-rises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| to assist residents who are facing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| to prevent the homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| either through case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Sometimes they can help individuals get back on medication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| or help them get their rent paid, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| And if it can't be worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| then they work with the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| to find them alternative housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| so that they're not evicted to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| The project's been extremely successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Since we've started funding it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| they've had literally no evictions to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| So it's a very successful project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| But like you said, the HPRP funds are running out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| We'd like to continue this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| and we have enough funding right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| to carry it through the end of this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| And we did hear from CAC, and they were doing a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| of managing their case workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| Yes, it's a very successful project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| It really does cut down on the number of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| that end up being homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| Going forward, you're not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| whether we're gonna get some other source of funding or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| Yeah, we received word today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| although it hasn't been voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| the committees working on the funding at the federal level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| have come to an agreement, and we will be cut again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| I don't exactly know the amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| the percentage that will be cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| but it's somewhere around probably another 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| So we just have to wait and see exactly what that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| and see what programs we're able to fund and not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| This is certainly a priority for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Thank you, Ms. Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| I'd like to reiterate what Director Wade said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| This program has been incredibly successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| and I know, just as a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| sometimes it's confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| because surrounding the complex issue of homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| we hear a lot about case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| And we can have case management at the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| or case management at the back end, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| We talk about case management with our folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| that are entering into the supportive housing facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| And they're very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| But obviously, if we can case manage folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| that are in danger of becoming homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| it's much more efficient use of public funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| and a great way to prevent that whole cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| from happening at the very start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| And just the results that they have had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| zero evictions to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| is a huge step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| And I'm certainly able to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| the designation of these funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| because it is prevention, it's case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| that we know has a track record of success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| and saves taxpayer dollars on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| Yeah, and I'd just like to recognize Barbara Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| She's here, Director of CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Becky, that's what I was going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| and also ask Ms. Kelly if she'd like to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| I know you and I had a conversation about your successes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| And would you just share a few with Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| in terms of what has happened in the past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| and how this money is being used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| And of course, I brought a few handouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| just in case anybody asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| We might give you each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| But this project has been in operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| actually since July of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| With our federal funding, we've been in operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| since September 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| And during that period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| we've served 336 individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| who were at imminent risk of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| I think the conversation that you had earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| about the mental health facility at Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| kind of strikes home because many of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| that are residing in these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| do have a number of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| and not the least among them being mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| And one of the things that the case managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| are able to do, being right there on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| is they're able to connect people with services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| They're able to get them connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| with a primary care physician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| able to have payees established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| so that they're able to pay their rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| And then in some instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| connect them with church groups who can come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| and help them deal with some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| of hoarding and things of this sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| that also put them at risk of being evicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| And of course, at CAC, we just agree with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| that prevention is the very, very best homeless program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| It's compassionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| It's clearly cheaper than other alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| And it has much more likelihood of being successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| So during this period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| we've also been able to reduce the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| We started out with two case managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| at each of the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| And as we've gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| we've actually reduced that number down to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| now I think we have pretty much just one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| at most of the locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| which has enabled us to reduce those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| And if you wanna do the arithmetic with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| with all the funding that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| in 38 months of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| the cost of keeping a resident in stable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| and avoiding homelessness has averaged out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| to between $65 and $70 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| or about $2.25 a day per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| And it's been our pleasure really to serve in this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| and to get to demonstrate the effectiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| of this approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| So we really appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| All right, thank you, Ms. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Yes, I just wanted to echo some of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| said especially Councilperson's Roddy's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| about the cost benefit of preventative as far as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| And I've had several discussions with Ms. Kelly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| and also have been impressed with the efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| they've been operating on that have been presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| through budget hearings earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| And I also would be very supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| I echo what my colleagues has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| I've also talked with Barbara several times about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| And I think as we move forward on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| to address the issue of homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| which will be with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| I think that we really need to look at this model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| as a very proactive way of addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| the problem of homelessness and how to prevent it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| and not have people on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| So I also join my colleagues in applauding what you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| but I really do think we need to very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| look at this model as an approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| as we go down this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| We need, we don't have a motion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Then move and properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2293)|
| 0:38:13| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| to enter into an agreement with the Knoxville Area Urban League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| for continued management and implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| of the Empowerment Zone Small Business Loan Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| in an amount not to exceed $126,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Before we go any further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| I see the director of the Urban League here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| Would you care to come and address us on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| You can give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| if you don't mind, and title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| Hi, I'm Phyllis Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| I live at 9711 Valley Woods Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| president and CEO of the Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| and I'd like to thank the mayor and council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| for your confidence in us to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| managing the Empowerment Zone portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| I also have with me the person who really does the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| Mr. Felix Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Felix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| He's our director of lending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| And for the past five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Felix has been working to not only support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| existing businesses, but through the Empowerment Zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| Small Business Loan Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| we have created 29 new businesses in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| And we're looking forward to continuing this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| As we all know, small business capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| is just about the hardest funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| that you can find right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| And the portfolio, the diversity of the portfolio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| the businesses that the Urban League is able to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| is really a major part of what's going on here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| So we thank you for your confidence in us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| We also want to say thank you to Ms. Wade and her team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| who are technical advisors to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| And so it's been a good partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| So the last four and a half years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| have been good for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Councilman DelaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Yes, before you leave, Ms. Nichols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| is my understanding correct that as the loans get processed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| and do their job of helping folks with their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| as they're repaid, that money goes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| sort of into the pot so we can relend it to new businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| One of the initial problems that the program had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| was the public perception that it was a grant program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| This is a revolving loan program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| And what the Urban League has been successful with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| is making sure loans are paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| so that we are building up a loan reserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| so that we can continue the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| So not only do they succeed, but by repaying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| they're helping the next business get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| But I do want to ask you, this is Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| the loans are made to people who would not qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| for loans at regular banks, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| But hardly anybody qualifies at both banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| But yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| All right, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| Sorted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2491)|
| 0:41:31| 11G is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| to enter into a contract with Design and Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| Services, Inc. for the Middlebrook Pikes sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| improvements project for an amount not to exceed $186,049.40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2499)|

| 0:41:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Mayor Brown, you and I share the area that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| will benefit from this sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| And Mr. King, I'm quite certain that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| will have no problem finding where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| to locate the sidewalk from the well-worn path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| I travel that road almost daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| And I'm thrilled that people will have a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| and not use the railroad tracks anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| So thank you for taking care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Ditto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| So all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2539)|

| 0:42:22| Sorted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2543)|

| 0:42:44| Mayor, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2565)|
| 0:42:45| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| I just hope we have someone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Maybe Mr. King can address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| But this is another leg up in the Downtown North project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| where we're trying to get the streetscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| and get the usability sort of pedestrian-friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| so we can regrow the businesses in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| and bring it back to life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| Do you want to expound on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Or do you want Mr. Wessel or someone to step up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| But I think it's important to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| to know that this is another area of concentration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| that is already achieving some success with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| of the businesses located on Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| And we hope to have more success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2606)|
| 0:43:26| You're absolutely correct in what you said there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| This is the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| We did a detailed design process in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| And this is where we did a conceptual process in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| And this is to put the detail planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| into that using TDOT money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| So it's going to be about a three-year process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| three to four years before it's built out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| I'll remind you that we are going to restrike the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| hopefully, here before Thanksgiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| if the weather holds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| We have everything in place to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| So we continue to work on that stretch between Woodland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| and basically the Old City, between the Old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| City and Happy Holler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| But you're going to have parking and trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| and pedestrian-friendly sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| and those types of things that help businesses survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2645)|
| 0:44:05| Could you give us your name and title for the record, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Bob Wessel, Director of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2651)|
| 0:44:11| Bob, before you leave, you mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| that it was TDOT money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| But it's an 80-20, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| The city does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2655)|
| 0:44:15| It is an 80-20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| I only mentioned that to mention the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| I've learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| 11-I is the resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| to execute change order number four to contract number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| CO-80163 between the city of Knoxville and Vaughan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| and Milton Consulting Engineers, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| for the Wesseland Drive bridge replacement and drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| project to increase the contract price by $12,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| for a new contract price of $218,952| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| and extend the contract time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| And moved and probably seconded, Councilman De La Lopa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| Yes, I wonder if Mr. King can tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| this contract has had another change order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| And I noticed that we started at $81,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| and now we're up to $218,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| I know when you start tearing into hidden things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| costs go up, and prices go up, and additional work is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| But could you fill us in on the evolution of this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| Sure, I turned around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| I couldn't find anybody else to answer this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| so you'll have to listen to my answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| I'm sure it'll be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Originally, we were going to only work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| on one bridge, the bridge to the west of the waterwheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2726)|
| 0:45:34| As we got further into the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| we found that instead of totally replacing one bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| we were able to extend the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| and provide the same degree of safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| and to carry the amount of stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| through the culvert as was necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| So we added another bridge, so both of the narrow bridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| that are close together on Westland will be widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| In addition to that, there's a bad curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| a little farther to the west that we have added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| to the project to make some improvements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| So those were the previous change orders that were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| This particular change order is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| to address some issues that we, as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| dealt with property owners during the right-of-way process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| and to provide some funding for the consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| to be used on call during construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| You've got some steepness on Westland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| so you've got water that jumps ditches from time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Addressing that as you do the bridge work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2798)|

| 0:48:29| Councilman DelVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| Yes, I see we have a revised copy of the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| There's one provision that I wonder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| if it needs to be in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| If we look at the third page of the revised handout, item 6i,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2919)|
| 0:48:47| the second sentence purports to tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| I guess whoever uses this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| how to charge their batteries using a solar panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| and commercial tricklers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| And I just wonder if that belongs in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| It specifies a certain battery usage and size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| and certain electrical standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| But I wonder if we have the competence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| to be deciding how batteries get charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| or whether inadvertently we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| someone's proprietary system a must have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| And I don't think that the city should have favoritism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| if that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| I would recommend or move that we delete the second sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| of 6i as really not needed to accomplish the purpose that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| have here and probably better without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2977)|
| 0:49:37| I know the law department as well as the Knoxville Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| Department and the Knoxville Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| work extensively on revisions to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| Is there anyone here in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| that could speak to this and specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| the solar charging piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| If you'd give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| Cindy Gassell, 201 Winter Mist Drive, Cary, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| I'm business development director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| for one of the companies that does install| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| electric security fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| And so I'm here as an expert on the systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| The reason that this is in here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| because the whole safety issue of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| the battery-powered fence, it revolves around the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| You don't want to allow someone to plug this system into the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| and into the grid and therefore have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| to pull additional power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| So the actual international, the IEC standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| that it refers to, that this ordinance also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| refers to that we must follow and be in compliant with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| also states that it's a battery-charged system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| that's solar panel charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| So that the standard committee is actually asking for solar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3058)|
| 0:50:58| And the only thing the trickle charger does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| is you don't want anything to plug into the city's grid that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| can pull additional power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| The only thing that the trickle charger does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| is actually charges the battery itself in like a cloudy day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| If you have several cloudy days in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| then it would charge the battery, but not the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3072)|
| 0:51:20| I will withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| Been moving properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3085)|
| 0:51:25| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3087)|
| 0:51:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| Let me ask, let me ask, would this not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| have to go back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| I believe, I talked with representatives of the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| department earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| And because we have provisions of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| that deal with certain impact in zoning areas with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| to the areas in commercially zoned areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| where some can be located and some cannot be located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| under the Supreme Court case, the Cherokee Country Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| Supreme Court case, it very clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| said that any ordinance which in some way impacts our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| must, in fact, be reviewed by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| This, of course, it would be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| that impacts areas that is dealt with with regard to zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| because they are permitted in industrially zoned areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| and some commercially zoned areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Therefore, in my view, it does need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| to go to MPC for review before it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| before you for second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| And I would call upon Mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| to tell us whether he would concur with that opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| or not, because I don't claim to be the world's foremost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| I just listen to what the Tennessee Supreme Court tells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| me from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| Using a Shillelagh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3170)|
| 0:53:04| Mark Donaldson, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| I wasn't here at the time of the Cherokee Country Club case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| but congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| Considered myself lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| Certainly, with any ordinance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| amends the zoning ordinance itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| you are required to have a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| from the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| I have not read the proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| and certainly will take it under consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| and weigh in with any expertise that we may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| I know that many communities do address all sorts of fences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| within their zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| And we do address fencing in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| within the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| So it may be an opportunity to include it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| within the body of the zoning ordinance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| I would certainly have a much greater comfort level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| if it got referred to MPC and they got it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| to us, hopefully on an expedited basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| well, as quickly as they can, maybe by the December 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| If that is possible to be done, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| Our December meeting is on the 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| so that will occur before December 13th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| Do we need to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| Well, you don't really need to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| I would just ask that one of you request that it be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| by, that it be referred to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| So I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| Just pass it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| But then I'll take care of sending a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| to the Metropolitan Planning Commission, sending it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| We don't need a formal motion with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| But I would suggest that one of you suggest that to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| and I'll take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| I'll suggest that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| Mayor, I was just going to ask Mr. Donaldson the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| If you could expedite that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| This is taking quite a bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| And so the sooner the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3314)|

| 0:57:36| I understand that what we're looking at tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| is the old version of this hillside and ridgetop plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3460)|

| 0:57:47| from the council and commission's series of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3467)|

| 0:57:57| on November the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| Is that correct, Mr. Donaldson, if you're still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| Yes, oh, you're on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| As a result of your meeting last Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| we were able to create enough copies over the weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| for county commission's consideration at their agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3492)|

| 0:58:19| They will take it up on next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| We hope to have some resolution of that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| And then we will know exactly what they're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| And hopefully, you can act on the same plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| at the November 29th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| And we will have the marked up version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| Yes, we'll provide both a redlined version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| and a clean copy for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| You recommend that we postpone this then at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| I would prefer that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3529)|

| 0:58:54| Yes, to the November 29th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| All right, it's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3539)|

| 0:59:02| Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| 12A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| Appendix B, Zoning Regulations, Article V, Section 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| signs, billboards, and other advertising structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| regarding the maximum height of ground and monument signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| We have two people signed up to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3561)|
| 0:59:27| First is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| You'd give your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| Yes, thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| My name is Joyce Feld, and I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| And I'm here as president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| I want to say that Scenic Knoxville is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| delighted to see this proposal come before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| We thank Councilman Bailey for proposing the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| We think it opens an important conversation, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| will lead to a more attractive and scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| We do have some concerns, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| about some aspects of the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| First, we're concerned about the maximum height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| of 50 feet for ground signs allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| in zone A for properties at interstate interchanges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| We think the intent of the city council resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| was to get away from these unsightly and unnecessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| tall signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| I think we need to recognize that more and more drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| today depend on GPS systems, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| are available in cars as portable devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| and on smartphones, which makes the necessity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| of seeing these tall signs from the interstate unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| In zone A, we think a maximum height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| of 25 feet for ground signs and 10 feet for monument signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| is adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| And I've passed around a little chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| which compares the MPC recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| and our recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| In zone B, for a property adjacent to the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| right away, we would like to see the maximum ground sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| height lowered from 35 feet to 25 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| and monument signs lowered from 12 feet to 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| We also have a question about whether businesses in this zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| will have the right to have signs both on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| they front and along the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| and if so, whether they need both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| In zone C, for property fronting on federal highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| we'd like to see the maximum ground sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| height lowered from 20 feet to 15 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| and monument signs lowered from 10 feet to 8 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| And when I say lowered from, I mean lowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| from the MPC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| And finally, for properties in zone D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| which is all other eligible property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| we would like to see the maximum ground sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| height lowered from 15 feet to 10 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| and monument signs lowered from 8 feet to 6 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| We think these sign heights offer adequate visibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| and are in keeping with many other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| And we've passed around some information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| that we've compiled about several other cities in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| And you'll see, I think, that these proposed sign heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| compare favorably with many other sign ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| There are those, predictably, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| we know will sound the alarms and pronounce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| the end of commercial development in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| and predict the failure of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| because they can't have tall signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| But businesses don't come or thrive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| because they can have a big sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| They come because they determine the economic vitality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| of a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| They determine that the economic vitality of a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| is sufficient to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| And an economically vibrant city is an attractive one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| where people want to live and work and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| A few months ago, I told you that John Shore, former mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| of Franklin, Tennessee, said that the economic success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| of Franklin was due, in large part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| to strict zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| He further said that when he asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| Nissan why they chose to locate their headquarters in Franklin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| they responded that they protect their investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| by locating in communities that protect their quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| In other words, Shore believes that a city with strict zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| is a pro-business city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| And scenic Knoxville also believes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| We also have Miss Margaret Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| If you'd give your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| My name is Margot Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| I'm here representing the West Knox County Homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3812)|
| 1:03:39| Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| And I'm from 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| I would like to just mention that although I represent people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| who live in the county, that the signage that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| is along our major roads, for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| is on land that has been annexed to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| And therefore, there's some specific developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| that are of great concern to West Knox County homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| Cheryl Hill, which we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| North Shore Town Center, and Kroger's Marketplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| at Kingston Pike and Cedar Bluff are being developed right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| So whatever you decide is going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| a direct and immediate effect on the quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| of the people who live in the neighborhoods that are bordering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| on these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| And just as Miss Felt said, we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| want to have a vibrant economy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| We welcome businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| We live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| We use products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| We like to have commercial businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| that we don't have to drive too far to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| We don't mind attractive signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| But we do not want to have tall, lighted signage directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3897)|
| 1:05:04| next to where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| So that's why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| I'd also like to say, specifically last Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| I was at the MPC meeting because there was a proposed sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| for a Chewy's restaurant, which is going in at the Kroger's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3917)|
| 1:05:23| Marketplace at Kingston Pike and Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| And the proposal was for a 25-foot ground sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| I asked for that to be lowered to a 10-foot monument sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| to be in keeping with the unified development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| there, because that Kroger's Marketplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| is a multi-tenant development that's quite large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| And the Chewy's is going in on out parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| And I pointed out that it appeared to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| that, considering that the master sign for Kroger's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| was only going to be 25 feet and would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| have multiple tenants on it, and that the Kroger's monument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| signs are only going to be 8 feet at the entrances that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| aren't on Kingston Pike directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| that it made sense to me that the signs on out parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| would be limited to 10- or 8-foot monument-style signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| And Mr. Frank Biller, who's the VP of operations southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| for Chewy's, spoke and said he would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| be happy to lower the signage to 10-foot monument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| And I think that there are many, many businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| in national-level businesses that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| would love to come to Knoxville and would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| be dissuaded by having to put in a lower sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| because they know that it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| more appealing to neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| And they want to be a friendly business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| that will attract neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| Mr. Biller talked to me after the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| He immediately called the president or CEO of the company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| got approval on that 10-foot monument sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| and said, please tell all your folks that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| and the heads of organizations that you're in contact with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| that we want you to come to us, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| happy to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| And I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4038)|
| 1:07:18| I immediately sent out an email to 186 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| including many people who are the heads of organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| So all this is kind of a personal appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| to say thank you very, very much for considering this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| and that it is not anti-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| We are not anti-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| We want Knoxville to look better, be more productive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| more successful, because we live here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| As my colleagues know, we've been working on signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4074)|
| 1:07:54| And I was very, very pleased when Councilman Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| made the resolution to reduce our ground signs to 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| I've also had a number of conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| with different businesses and also with Mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| over this particular proposal that he's put before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| And a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| I want to commend him on the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| that he took the idea of reducing our ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| signs to 25 feet, but he also took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| into account of looking at different districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| in our city in terms of what's really needed in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| of whether we're talking along the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| or along just a regular road within the city in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| of how he has it broken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| I did talk to him about there's a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| that I had that he answered for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| If you'll notice in the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| Magnolia Avenue is exempt from the C category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| And the reason for this is that the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| is that they hope to have, and correct me on this, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| Donaldson if I'm not correct, but that they hope to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| a form-based code put into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| for the development of Magnolia Avenue in terms of the signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4145)|
| 1:09:05| I guess similar to what's on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| We also talked about the heights of the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| And one of the things that I do want to share with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| is that, as you know, I've been working with the Cheryl Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| Development folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| And I have to go back sometimes to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| Ms. Fells has said is that most businesses, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| have an A plan, a B plan, and a C plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| And I found that to especially be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| If you all recall, we said that the directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| or the main sign for the Cheryl Hill Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| we limited it to 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| And it originally started out at 50, and then 45, and 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| and then 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| And we finally voted on 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| And within a matter of days, that sign went up at 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| And the business is on that particular sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| So the developer went ahead and put the sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| Academy Sports, which is there, had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| agreed to go ahead with a monument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| sign on the grounds, which is only 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| Well, during that time, Alki Foods and Gordon Foods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| had already gotten, or at least Gordon Foods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| had gotten a permit for a 30 foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| Alki Foods had wanted one for 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| And in working with them, just as Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| Klein calling the Mexican restaurant place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| I called Alki to see if whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| they would consider a 10 foot sign along Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| As you all recall, that particular stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| from Cedar Bluff on out, the signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| are all lower, both sides of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| that really had been working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| And so anyway, they had agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| Gordon Foods were working with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| because they had approval originally of 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| We're now down to the last couple of emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| the last couple of days, we have been at 15, 12, 10, and 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| So we're still going back and forth on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| But it's a far cry from 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| And those businesses also have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| that they realize that if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| allowed to go 50 feet, or how high they can go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| they'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| But if they have an understanding of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| it is that we're trying to do in terms of protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| environment and make it look the way we would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| to see in terms of really showing the quality of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| that they are willing to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| The Kroger's development there on the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| is working with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| And so now Cheryl Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| And I really think that we have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| to go down through Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| One of the things that I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| is that I don't want to see us get caught up that we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| pass this or pass a form of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| Because also in talking with Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| I talked to him about the fact that we would really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| like to review the whole sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| There's a number of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| And Mr. Donaldson can maybe talk to those at his presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| at the forum that he gave the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| He talked about other issues in the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| that we really ought to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| The other thing is I've had discussions with Dr. Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| on the county side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| And as you know, Dr. Briggs is very much interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| in signage in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| And he and I were talking about the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| that if we could get an ordinance that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| both good for the county as well as the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| it would be good for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| As I mentioned before, when you drive down Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| you don't really know whether you're in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| or you're in the county in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| of the environment and the look that we have down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| So I would really like to see us take into consideration what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| Senior Knoxville has proposed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| but definitely going back to what Councilman Bailey had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| to say in terms of the ground signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| being a maximum of 25 feet, if we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| But I would ask Mr. Donaldson, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| had mentioned at your presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| some other areas of the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| that we might want to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| Would you just kind of mention that so that we know maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| where we're headed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| Well, in general, the sign code looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| like it's been cobbled together over several decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| And that's because it has been cobbled together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| over several decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| And as you look at other communities around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| that have recently updated their zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| there most often is a clearly defined set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| of signs that don't need permits and a clearly defined list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| of signs that are prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| And more and more communities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| going to this concept of creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| dimensional requirements that meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| the context of the community by addressing various districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| such as we have proposed in this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| Acknowledging that businesses along the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| are different than businesses in a town center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| or a local street, or on a local street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| or on a collector street, that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| different than commercial strips along an arterial highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| Addressing the fact that ground signs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| different than monument signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| If we buy into those two concepts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| that context should be a factor, that one size does not fit all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| and that ground signs are different than monument signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| we've made great strides towards modernizing the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4472)|
| 1:14:40| There was discussion at our public meeting about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| well, sign height is related to allowable sign area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| so there is a relationship between height and sign area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| We need to address that eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| We have the opportunity to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| the amortization of non-conforming signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| that would result from amending the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| We should take that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| There are some provisions that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| have addressed in this proposed amendment, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| that eliminates an exception to the setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| requirement for signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| And another one addresses a provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| that allows signs within a certain distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| of the interstate to set their height in relation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| to the surface level of the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| currently at 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| Well, if you look at our interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| and look at our parallel commercial corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| you see that quite often both sides of that corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| are within 500 feet of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| So businesses, for example, on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| of Kingston Pike, have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| to size their sign height according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| to the surface level of the interstate system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| in the event that they're below that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| We've proposed amending that to reduce that distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| and make it so that it's likely that only those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| that are truly adjacent to the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| So recently, we've addressed historic and landmark signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| We've addressed an incidental sign package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| Those could be shortened by redoing the entire sign code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| and addressing the administrative procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| in one section rather than reproducing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| with every type of sign that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| So there are a lot of opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| to clean up the sign code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| Have we, in this one, though, where we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| about the heights of the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| we're not addressing the size of the sign itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| the square footage of the page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| No, we didn't take that liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| That's not in this proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| But again, this can be a working document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| Certainly, it can be an important first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4633)|
| 1:17:20| Councilman Delavope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| Well, we have Mr. Donaldson there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| I wonder if I could ask him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| First off, I wanted to state, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| that I really was pleased that you had gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| beyond just the original question that council had said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| and looked at how signs in different areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| might need to be different in heighth and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| And I think that was helpful to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| that kind of planning judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| And I certainly am pleased to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| that you talk about an amortization program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| This is an opportunity to get rid of the signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| that are just way out of keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| with the attractiveness and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| but still allowing the business to get the useful value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| out of the sign and then later putting up a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| that's more in conformance with the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| I guess my question goes, I've heard Ms. Fells speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| and I'm wondering why you have ground heighth at 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| for those signs near the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| where you think cars are moving quicker and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| Why not 25 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| I mean, how do you come up with the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| I guess, is the real question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| And we took a look at many cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| obviously a different set of cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| than scenic Knoxville did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| We looked at Asheville, Lexington, Nashville, Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| and Chattanooga sign codes and found within that set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| two recent ordinance amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| that addressed specifically signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| within a certain radius of interchanges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| Memphis has a brand new land development code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| that was adopted late this summer, early fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| where they have literally created a map with radii| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| from every interstate interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| and allow a 50 foot sign within that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| Lexington recently amended their code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| to address interstate interchange signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| and used a 90 foot maximum height there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| while at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| reducing the sign heights elsewhere in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| Generally, they have fairly short signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| but at the interchange-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| Is that a function of lobbying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| I guess I'm coming down to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| what's the appropriate sign height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| recognizing that, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| businesses want as much as they can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| and communities want a little less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| so that it's not unattractive and distracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| This 50 foot, I mean-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| Well, given those two recent examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| and given the fact that we currently are at 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| I kind of set that as the starting point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| and ratcheted down from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| as we looked at other districts within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| So as a result, you have 50 is the tallest sign allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| at interchanges of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| Then the next tallest sign is for properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| adjacent to the interstate at 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| That corresponds to a current provision in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| that says the maximum sign height for ground signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| that are within a certain distance of scenic parkways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| and scenic highways has to be 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| Or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| The maximum height is 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| So, pegged that level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| and then looking at that set of five cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| we found that many of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| for most of their zone districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| use a 20 foot maximum sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| So then ratcheted down from 35 to 20 for the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| The Chattanooga code uses a strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| of allowing a taller sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| as you move it farther away from the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| which is also a strategy that we used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| in a city, a resort town that I worked in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| so that as signs approach the right-of-way they shrink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| As they move away from the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| they are allowed to get taller and bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| Chattanooga has a basic maximum height of 20 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| but allows up to a 30 foot sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| if you move it at least 10 feet away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| from the minimum required setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| So these recommendations are a combination of all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| Then we looked at all of the other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| that you can have ground signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| and pegged that at 15 feet, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| Do we do any harm by reducing 50 feet to 25 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| In other words, part of this is preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| and part of this has a rationale of readability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| safety and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| Is there some magic number that we cannot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| Well, there certainly is a commonly acknowledged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| sign principle that the more volume of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| and the higher speeds that they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| you need bigger signs and more legible signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| in order to have them safely read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| So most city, or many cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| will use that sort of a relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| so that signs along a heavily traveled high-speed arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| will be allowed to be bigger and taller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| Whereas, and then as you reduce the speed limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| reduce the traffic volumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| many communities shift to a monument sign requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| and that sort of thing, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| But that's the rationale of why you allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| Is there any safety study or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| that mandates a certain size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| Yeah, there is, there are planning documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| that actually will peg a certain font size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| for lettering on signs and relate that to a speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=4999)|
| 1:23:25| We had this sort of a discussion when we did the EMC signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| and in that amendment we did peg the font size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| to the sign area and to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| I can't remember exactly the relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| but there is a relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| The size of the word is not the height of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| That's the size. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| In that particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Thank you, Councilman, Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| I think this is a good start and it spells out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| addresses the fact that one size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| doesn't fit all circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| and that it has a lot of very good suggested language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| that leads us in the right direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| and what I would recommend is that we pass this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| and then we take these areas, these districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| these zones, what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| and ultimately talk about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| and make them more clearly defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| because when you talk about surface levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| I think that's when you're getting in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| All businesses and property owners have a right to be seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| but I think the point is that the higher you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| doesn't necessarily mean you have an advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| or it's gonna increase your business or what have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| but that we do have a lot of scenic views around here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| and they need to be protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| and so that we ought to come up with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| that's fair for all in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| and that we, today moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| have some control over this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| but I think the most important thing in the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| is that we do have clearly defined heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| that considers all the factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| that I think this language begins to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| so what I would recommend after we discuss this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| is that we pass this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| and then we break it down into these districts one by one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| and have a discussion on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| I agree with, excuse me, I agree with Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| I think we should approve this on first reading tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| I'm confident that the recommendations that are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| are based on sound planning science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| That's what we pay the MPC to do on our behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| and I'm pleased that there is some differentiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| based upon context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| That was something that we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| when Vice Mayor Bailey asked for the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| to do this research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| I do feel strongly that the need is different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| in different contexts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| I, for one, don't use a GPS, don't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| My car didn't come with one, don't have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| and I need signs and I rely on signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| particularly when I'm a visitor to an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| to find businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| One request that I would add, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| as you go forward with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| Councilman DeLavalle talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| the idea of amortization of the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| Having just had beer board earlier this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| when we talk a lot about pre-existing non-conforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| businesses, I'm wondering if it's possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| to write into that future language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| if a new business comes into a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| and they inherit, so to speak, a non-conforming sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| as that new business takes over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| could they be asked to adhere to the new sign code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| Perhaps that's part of the amortization language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| that that amortization of the investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| in the original sign goes with the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| or the business owner that paid for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| But if we're serious about making this change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| in our community, then I think we need to build in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| some caveats, just like when a council before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| had the courage to put an end to permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| new billboards with the knowledge that it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| take some time for the billboards that were existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| to gradually disappear in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| Oh, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| Want to just say a comment in regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| what Councilman Roddy had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| It was interesting, I did have a car the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| that had a GPS and it was interesting to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| driving down the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| the little map showed up and there was the little bed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| and there was a little knife and fork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| and there was the little gas pump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| that showed up as I drove down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| And also I realized on my telephone it was the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| And so I think that one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| that we ought to look to is as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| what the future's going to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| that probably a lot of these signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| are going to become obsolete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| If you think about the technology, what we just have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| And you don't have to have a GPS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| you can have your own telephone in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| what it would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| What I would like to see happen is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| and again as I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| I commend MPC for what they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| but what I would like to do is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| go ahead and move ahead and approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| but what I'd like to do is substitute in item number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| I would like to substitute what Scenic Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| has proposed for the chart in number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| and move ahead on first reading on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| I'd like to make that a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| Motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| We don't have a motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| So, and let me recognize Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| I appreciate the comments of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| and I particularly appreciate MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| recognizing that one size doesn't fit all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| and coming up with a variety of responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| to different needs throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| Different cities address this in a different way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| and clearly we do have some sign needs in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| that need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| Councilman Grieve and I were at a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| a few weeks ago with one of his preferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| digital billboard signs nearby on Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| and I did have to smile thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| how painful it must have been for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| But in addition to these particular signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| I also hope that as we look at signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| we consider the clutter signs that appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| I'm not talking about political signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| I'm talking about the weight loss, roof repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| babysitting that seem to permeate our byways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| and highways throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| and I would hope that we would also incorporate those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| into a massive review of signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| Let me ask you, if the sign code is reworked and redone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| and it comes back, it goes to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| and comes back to Council, roughly in a time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| what are we talking about in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| and it looks like we're gonna go to that eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| If we are looking at revising the entire code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| I would expect that that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| at least a year-long process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| filled with many, many public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| You start bringing in the tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| and the resort type people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| and my experience has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| that it will take at least a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| It'd be a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| Well, we don't have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| Been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| I'd like to move to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| I think we need to get the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| can we go ahead and do the amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| Go ahead and amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5451)|
| 1:30:52| I'd like to amend item number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| to the chart that Scenic Knoxville has proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| with the sign heights there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| I know either way, we're gonna review these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| and I think that what I'd like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| is that we start with the heights that they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5466)|
| 1:31:12| and then as we go through the review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| if we need to raise them, we could also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| So it's whether or not we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| with the smaller size and work up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5478)|
| 1:31:19| or from the larger size and work down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| But I'd like to amend it to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| what Scenic Knoxville has come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| on chart number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| All right, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| Been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| I'd like to speak to the amendment that's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| As I said earlier, I think the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| that were provided to us this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| by the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| are based on sound planning science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| Mr. Donaldson said that context should be a factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| and one size doesn't fit all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| I think the four zones that are outlined here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| are reasonable and I think the sign heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| that are suggested are a reasonable starting place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| We've got to remember that we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| some pretty major changes here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| from what is currently allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| and we're going to set up a bifurcated system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| We're gonna set up, we're setting ourselves up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| for a two-level system here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| where we have businesses that already exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| that are allowed to have much higher signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| and new businesses that are coming in that aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| And for a time, I'm afraid there's gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| a real sense of inequity among those businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| And certainly we want to be a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| that's friendly to new business investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| and in this economy, we want new businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| to be able to come in and thrive and succeed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| and not feel like they are at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| And I feel like with all due respect to Councilman Grieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| I feel like the amendment that he made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| is too severe a jump from where we sit now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| and I think that the numbers that were provided to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| by the Planning Commission are a sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| and reasonable and defensible place to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| All right, Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| Thank you, Mayor, and I think Councilman Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| that's well put, I couldn't put it any better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| I would just like to say that I really hadn't had a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| to look at these specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| and I don't know that I would be opposed to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| I just haven't had a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| And there probably are some unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| And so I think the best way for us to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| is to pass what the MPC has recommended tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| and to go back district by district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| and have that discussion because our current businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| and property owners and future businesses deserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| So I concur wholeheartedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| so I cannot support Councilman Grieve's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Thank you, I concur with Councilwoman Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| Mr. Grieve, I certainly appreciate your concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| and interest in that of scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| but I do think that since we're going to have this year long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| or longer review of the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| I think that we need to go with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| what the Planning Commission has brought forth tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| and then during that long period of review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| we might not want to think this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| but I will not be supporting the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| Sounds like where this is headed, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| Let me just say this, that I think that, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| I don't disrespect what MPC has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| In fact, I really appreciate what they've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| and Mark and I have had some good conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| about the signage and I think that eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| we're going to end up at the right place for our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| and that's what we all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| I think that what I'm sharing with you folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| is the fact that I've worked now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| with three different businesses that are coming into town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| and they don't feel, Councilman Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| as though they're being chastised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| for having a smaller sign, you know, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| And, in fact, if anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| they feel that they're beginning to understand also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| that they see that the sign and what we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| in that particular area is a benefit to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| and that their advertisement is still seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| I just think that really where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| and again, as I said earlier, I want this thing to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| so that we can work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| I think it's just a matter of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| do we go with the smaller signs and go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| or do we go with the larger signs and go down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| I will say this, that I would like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| as we go through this, that we do get additional input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| I know this has been on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| since we've talked about reducing the signs to 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| I've really been a little surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| that I haven't had any phone calls from businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| and I think, in all fairness, that we ought to be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| that we're in touch with those folks also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| But I do think the overriding thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| is that we do need to think about the vision of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| what we want our city to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| and what we want people to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| when they come into our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| When they come in on those interstates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| and when they get off the interstates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| and get onto the federal roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| and then when they get onto our city streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| what is it that they see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| And one of the things that I think that the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| before us newbies that have been here for two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| worked very hard to do was with the whole billboard situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| and then what we did with the EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| And I think our council has a real charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| to continue that effort to make this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| the best-looking city that we possibly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| and to do away with as much sign clutter as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| So, again, let's vote on the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| and we'll see where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| But I think the other thing is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| as long as we vote on the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| knowing that we can look at each one of these sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| I think that's what's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5782)|
| 1:36:23| So I leave it to my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| All right, your amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| Councilman Grieve's amendment is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| I don't know if it is needed to restate it at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| or are we clear on his amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| I think they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5795)|
| 1:36:35| All right, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5801)|
| 1:36:42| I guess we'll do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5813)|
| 1:36:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5818)|
| 1:36:58| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Vice Mayor Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| Okay, the amendment is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| All right, the amendment is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| As a matter of clarification, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| Thank you, colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| All right, Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| As a matter of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| is he saying that both numbers will be in number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| or just the scenic Knoxville numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| will be substituted in the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| What are we gonna see as the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| Scenic Knoxville numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| Now we need to vote on the ordinance as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| I would like to speak to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| As I stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| I was not able to support the amendment since it has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| I do have concerns about this amended ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| being unfair to businesses, having this bifurcated system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| I think particularly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| Councilman Grieve has talked about some of the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| that he worked with in the Cheryl Hill development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| there in a retail quarter on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| You know, one of the things that you notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| is that one of the specific zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| that speaks to the contextual nature of this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| is the property with interstate interchange areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| And we have just amended this from 50 feet to 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| And I'm thinking of an area like at Merchant Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| for example, at I-75 and Merchant Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| And you're gonna have some businesses with 50-foot signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| and some businesses with 25-foot signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| And I personally, particularly for Category A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| don't think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| I think it's too big a jump all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| And because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| I will not be supporting the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| I'd just like to agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| I think it's unfair as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| And it's really too much too soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| I think there's gonna be unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| And I don't think there's been a proper vetting of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| And it's just not fair, totally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| to do something like this this quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| I mean, we always talk about trying to get people's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| And I just saw this just moments ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| I really hadn't had the chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| And I don't think the public, I know the public hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| So I won't support it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| We need to move on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| Yes, we're about to do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5999)|
| 1:39:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| Motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6009)|
| 1:40:09| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| I voted for this as amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| because I want to see us move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| But I think it is important between this reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| and the second reading, whenever that occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| that we look at these numbers more carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| and we get some input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| It may be that 50 feet is way too high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| and it may be that 25 feet is too low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| And I think we need to have more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| about selecting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| There may be compromise or different numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| but I think we need some input from businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| and sign companies to understand what's at stake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| And I want to see the process move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| I think it's healthy that we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| but I don't mean to imply by my vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| that we won't take a hard look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| between now and the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| Well, I echo what Councilman Dela Volpe has to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| that that's my desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| is that we at least have the chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| we're at least ready to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| and that the whole idea is that we do get additional input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| and that we do look at these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| And that, as we said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| that there's a number of items in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| that need to be looked at and clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| And so that we have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| to also look at the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| One of the things that Mr. Donaldson referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| for instance, is that we don't say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| that a 25-foot sign on the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| we haven't said how big the face of the sign is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| And so there's some details that I think can be worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| and that we'll end up with a win-win situation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| All right, Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| Mr. Donaldson, looking at the language of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| it looks like these revised regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| were noticed for the NPC meeting on October the 13th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| and then noticed for the city council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| on November the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| But forgive me if I've missed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| have there been any public meetings on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| And I'm sure I missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| Tell me how many and how well attended they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| After you made the request to NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| to look at ordinance amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| we advertised and conducted a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| here in the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| It was attended by a dozen people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| I would concur with Councilman Graven and Della Volpe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| and Vice Mayor Bailey about the importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| of public input on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| and would suggest that with only two weeks time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6149)|
| 1:42:33| having already passed this motion as amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| and only two weeks time until the second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| that this council might want to consider a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| on second reading to allow some further time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| to hear from our constituents and business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| and seeing it Knoxville and everyone across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| Good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| That's a good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| I would also agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| In fact, I'll go so far as to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| that we postpone this for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| Is that a reasonable amount of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| I'm sorry, did you say what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| Six weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| A motion to postpone this for six weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| I just want to say this is going to be a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| This is the first vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| and whether we adopted it as presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| or the scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| I mean, this is going to be a long, tedious process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| I mean, I will be willing to bet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| about any amount of money up to a nickel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| that these numbers will change one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6211)|
| 1:43:36| And I don't want all the red flags| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| and the bells and the whistles to go off tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| because this will be vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| There'll be plenty of opportunity for input from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| However many sides there's going to be on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| So, but I think it is important to get it on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| and start the discussion and get the ball rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| But, you know, I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| I can't predict what will happen in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| but I'd be shocked if, you know, if it was finalized then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| I certainly wouldn't support that, I'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| So, you know, I support it just to get it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| Let's start, you know, let's start the talks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| Yeah, I too voted for the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| with some hesitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| but it was with the understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| that this would be a long process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| and that there would be a lot of public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| and that that would be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| So, Mr. Mayor, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| Oh, yes, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| Clarification point then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| So as far as postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| we can't postpone until we have the second reading, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6284)|

| 1:46:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| 12P is an ordinance to rezone property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| located on the southeast side of Sutherland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| northeast of North Forest Park Drive from C1 to R3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| Will Ferguson applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| Been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6409)|
| 1:46:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| Mayor, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| Oh, I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| I'm sorry, I was trying to get your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| before the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| I had a comment to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| My name's Will Ferguson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| I live at 8750 Hollingsfield Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| The reason I'm here asking for a few moments of your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| is that the objective of this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| was to change an existing zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| from C1 to R3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| It's adjacent to a larger piece of property that is R3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| The one condition that is on the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| is that there's no more than one curb cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| to Sutherland Avenue be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| along the entire street frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| of two different parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| Parcel number 107KF002| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| was the parcel that has to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| While there is some connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| there is not common ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| between parcel number two and parcel number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| And I think perhaps there was an inadvertent connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| of those two parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| such that there was a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| the MPC put the condition on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| that there'd just be one curb cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| but they're two separate parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| And so my request is that in approving this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| is that you reconsider the MPCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| or the passing of this through MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| and that those two parcels be considered separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| and the curb cuts either remain as they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| or there'd just be one curb cut per parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| which would seem more reasonable to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| rather than to affect a second parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| by the rezoning of another parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6510)|
| 1:48:34| Okay, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| Would Mr. Donaldson address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| We might have to address this at the second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| but I'm just curious why the one curb cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| with two parcels and possibly two different owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| The ultimate plan is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| make parking on this particular parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| available to the residents of the adjacent parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6537)|
| 1:49:01| And I would expect that over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| there will be a new parking configuration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| In the interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| there is the possibility of using a joint curb cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| to serve both parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| That is a fairly common practice in communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| that practice access management along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6560)|
| 1:49:26| So it is possible to provide access to both parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| with a single curb cut if it's located on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| Does that enhance safety to have one curb cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| instead of two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| Generally speaking, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| You want to minimize conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| and one way to do that is to manage curb cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| I'd recommend to the gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| that you come back at our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| We'll have a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| I'll be glad to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| Is that because it's already been voted on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| Already been voted on, I mean, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| I guess someone can move to reconsider, but you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| I would appreciate if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| It's not that I don't mind coming back again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| but I just didn't, I was coming up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| as fast as I could get up here to make a comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| The only problem from my perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| with combining the two pieces of parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| from a single curb cut is that the elevations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| of the two parcels are distinctly different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| and it's not as though you can drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| from one end to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| We do have a process where you sign up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| and they would have recognized you before we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| So, and that may be foreign to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| but I think that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| If you came back and be sure to sign up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| we would take that up, I think, at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| I hate to inconvenience you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| but I think that's kind of parliamentary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| Councilman Grieve, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| Yeah, I was just going to say, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| both the Pond Gap Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| and the Bearden Council had looked at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| and they were in agreement with the one curb cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| So, if there's any kind of changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| we need to definitely let them know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| and they thought that that's the way it was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| All right, well, if you could come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| on the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| If you should notify those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6672)|
| 1:51:12| Yeah, Mayor, I would just suggest that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| between now and the second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| that you contact some of us and let us know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| what your position is and what you'd like for us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| and then we'll have a discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| For second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6687)|
| 1:51:33| Well, Councilman Grieve, did you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| is that an old light or is that a new light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| Good night, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| When, what about the gentleman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| You had a gentleman that asked about public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| Oh, Mr. Cadmus, did you want to come and address us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6708)|
| 1:51:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| I'm from Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| You've already given us your name and address before, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| I figured if I get the chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| maybe I can salvage some of my time for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6726)|
| 1:52:11| Did the council members receive the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| I distributed through the city reporter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6734)|
| 1:52:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| And does anybody, do any of the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6742)|
| 1:52:27| have any comments or disagreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| with what I, with my position on the subject?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6751)|
| 1:52:37| Could you just summarize what your condition was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6757)|
| 1:52:41| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| Well, in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| You're opposed to the rezoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| Well, I'm opposed to putting a high-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6768)|
| 1:52:54| in O1, which calls for a medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| on the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| And it's a difference between six to 24 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| apartment units, and basically higher than 26 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6784)|
| 1:53:12| The request for the zoning change was for 42 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6792)|
| 1:53:17| And I don't think the one-year plan allows for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6797)|
| 1:53:23| Did we just change the one-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| Did we change the one-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6807)|
| 1:53:28| Also, there seems to be some ambiguous language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| in the ordinance on R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| R2 can be medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| or high-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| But O1 can only be medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| and there's no ambiguous language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| in any of the sector plans or one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6826)|
| 1:53:51| or the ordinances on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| If there is an ambiguous term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| that this request is depending on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6838)|
| 1:54:03| then the ambiguous term has to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| according to the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| I believe the most restrictive terms have to apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6848)|
| 1:54:19| which would mean R2 medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| instead of high-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| So 42 apartments wouldn't work there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6864)|
| 1:54:32| Well, oh, Councilman Del Lopia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| If I could ask, if he can briefly tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| why we're going to higher-density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| Mr. Donaldson, what's the rationale that got us here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| We're going to be taking this up at the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| but real quick, why high-density versus medium-density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| like the gentleman was suggesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| You're dealing with a request to change the zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| to change from C6 to O1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| The current sector plan calls for office zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| in this area, and the current one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| calls for mixed use with industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| and office zoning in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| The O1 district does allow residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| as a use-on-review using the R2 standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6917)|
| 1:55:23| but this request is to rezone the property to O1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6923)|
| 1:55:28| and that is consistent with your adopted land-use plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| And does that mean medium-density or high-density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| It doesn't mean any density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| It means O1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| Once you get to O1 zoning, then you're allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| by that zone district to develop residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| using the R2 standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| Which is the maximum, how many units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| Depends on your configuration and the mix of bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6952)|
| 1:55:57| and the amount of land that you have available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| to dedicate to open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| Okay, sounds like we're gonna be taking this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| in two weeks or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| In two weeks, you will be hearing an appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| of the BZA decision to grant variances for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| which is why the applicant requested that you postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| the zoning case until such time as you can consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| both the zoning and the appeal of the BZA decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6986)|
| 1:56:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| Mr. Cadmus, you may have to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6988)|
| 1:56:29| and talk to us again, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| I mean, in two weeks or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| Whenever I use my five minutes up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| Oh, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| I was thinking your five minutes is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| It is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7002)|
| 1:56:43| But if you can come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| and I tried to contact you twice today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| You contacted my office, and I did leave you two messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| I tried to contact your office twice today, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| I guess we were just missing each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| but I'm sorry for the inconvenience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| and hopefully you come back in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| Well, I didn't come back to Knoxville today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| I was on my way down when Mr. Hill called me yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| I was already back on my way to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| So my understanding was I had to be here anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| just in case it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| Well, as I said, sorry for any inconvenience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| but sometimes the wheels of government move slowly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| but we'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111115?start=7049)|
