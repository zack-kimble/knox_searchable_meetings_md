| 0:03:35| Mr. Dupler, would you mind providing some information regarding Executive Session, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| Yes, Madam Chair, thank you. The Board had an Executive Session this afternoon, which is a closed meeting under Smith County Education Association v. Anderson and Van Hooger v. Warren County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=221)|
| 0:03:55| That is an opportunity for the Board and its attorneys to discuss pending litigation or claims and there was no deliberation by the Board whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=235)|
| 0:04:06| It was simply a question and answer session for counsel. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| Thank you so much. Superintendent Thomas will not be joining us this evening. He is attending the Tennessee Organization of School Superintendents Legislative and Learning Conference in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=250)|
| 0:04:22| That's a mouthful. So hopefully he is learning lots and will bring that information back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=262)|
| 0:04:30| Also, we wanted to share some great news with you tonight and I would like to turn the floor over to Ms. Satterfield, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=270)|
| 0:04:39| Thank you, Madam Chair. So I serve in the First District and you know you get the joys of sitting right here by our student rep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=279)|
| 0:04:47| Our student rep is pretty amazing. We've been able to build bonds and have a lot of conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| He's a really dynamic student. So the committee that selected Noah Kelly, he did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| But in this moment, I would like to bring my director up from Maryville College, Elaine Bowman, if you can come to the podium in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=300)|
| 0:05:08| Elaine, if you could kind of tell us what's going on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=308)|
| 0:05:30| All right. Thank you. First, thank you for having us today. I'm Elaine Bowman. I'm the vice president for admissions and financial aid at Maryville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| This is Arielle Kilday. She's our associate director. And I thank you for this opportunity to talk a little bit about Maryville College and a little bit about Noah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=336)|
| 0:05:45| Maryville College is a nationally ranked institution of higher learning and one of America's most historic colleges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| For more than 200 years, we've educated students to be giving citizens and gifted leaders to study everything so they are prepared for anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=350)|
| 0:05:58| and to address any problem, engage with any audience and launch successful careers right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| Maryville College offers nearly 1,200 students from around the world, both the beauty of a rural setting and the advantages of an urban center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| as well as more than 60 majors, seven pre-professional programs and career preparation programs from the very first day of campus to their last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| Through our interactions with Noah Kelly at various on-campus events, through getting to know him through his interviews and essays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=379)|
| 0:06:27| we believe he is a perfect fit for Maryville College and I am excited what he will bring to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| I am proud to award him the full tuition McGill scholarship for his next four years. Welcome to the class of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=394)|
| 0:06:42| Yay!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=402)|
| 0:07:12| Alright, ready? One, two. Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=432)|

| 0:07:46| Mom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=470)|
| 0:07:59| I would like to just add a little bit to the scholarship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| There was over, I think about 50 people that interviewed for this and we selected five, 63, and we selected five full tuition scholarships, so Noah is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=483)|
| 0:08:13| Very nice. How fun to be able to recognize you, Noah, and congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| I know this board is very proud of you and we know that you will do great, great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=498)|

| 0:08:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Okay, do we have any changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| Okay, do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| We have a motion by Mr. Norman, a second by Ms. Babb. Any discussion? All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| Okay, and in Superintendent Thomas' absence, Assistant Superintendent John Ryswick will be delivering the report this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=531)|
| 0:09:01| Thank you, Madam Chair and board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| As Ms. Horn mentioned earlier, Superintendent Thomas is at the Tennessee Organization of School Superintendents Legislative and Learning Conference this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=543)|
| 0:09:11| so he's asked me to share some brief updates with you on his behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| First, I'd like to begin by congratulating South Knoxville Elementary, which will be recognized next week at the Tennessee Conference on Volunteerism and Service Learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=555)|
| 0:09:23| South Knoxville Elementary is one of only 16 schools across the state that will receive the conference's 2019 Award of Excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=563)|
| 0:09:31| The award recognizes outstanding work in areas of service, service learning, and volunteerism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| and the district is pleased to see the efforts of Dr. Tana Nicely and her staff paying off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| I'd also like to highlight an upcoming event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| On Tuesday, February 18th, Knox County Schools will celebrate its Teachers of the Year during a dinner at the Knoxville Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=584)|
| 0:09:52| This is a great opportunity to honor outstanding educators in our buildings, and the KCS district-wide winner will also be announced at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=592)|
| 0:10:00| We're excited to welcome board members to this special event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| Finally, I want to remind everyone of two student holidays that are coming up soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=603)|
| 0:10:10| Monday, February 17th is an in-service day, and Tuesday, March 3rd, a primary election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| Students will not be in class on either of those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| Madam Chairman, members of the board, that includes our report for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| Okay, and now we will have discussion of our February 12th regular session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| Board members, just a reminder that you should have received an email this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| explaining that staff received a contract from the Department of Education regarding the Governor's Civic Seal mini-grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=635)|
| 0:10:43| This grant is being considered as Item 7B on next week's voting agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| so that wording was updated to reflect the addition of that contract and is attached for your reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=648)|
| 0:10:57| Okay, do we have questions on Item 1, C1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=657)|
| 0:11:06| Okay, D1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=666)|
| 0:11:13| Okay, Item 2 or 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| 4 or 5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| 6 or 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Yes, I wanted to ask some questions about Number 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| I was reading through this, and it seems like a multi-step, I guess, Mr. Wilson, this is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| It seemed like a multi-step process, but I noticed the payment seemed to be for the first step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=701)|
| 0:11:47| but then the additional steps seemed to be taken out of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| So if you can just kind of speak to how this would go forward and how this group was selected maybe to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| I mean, it sounds like an interesting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| I noted that the statement there says something specific to industry certifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| and certainly that would probably be an outcome of the work, but it is much larger in scale than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| So the contract that we have as far as a commitment letter really is about the first step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| which is kind of an exploration visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| And what they do during that work is they really come in to meet with schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| and talk with principals and teachers, probably even board members, the superintendent, those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| to really get a grasp, even community partners as well, to get a grasp sort of on who are the role players| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| and stakeholders in the collective work around career and technical education, really, and academics as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=754)|
| 0:12:41| As far as kind of where we came from, how we landed in with them, I would say is if you go back about two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| when we were kind of talking through some of our strategic goals around putting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| the advanced academic program in every high school, so we're kind of having that APIB Cambridge identity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| and then also talking about really expanding out sort of the CTE identity in every campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| That work was kind of on my mind when I went to a conference in 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| and I happened to come into a session that Ford was putting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| and in that they were really talking about the work they do with community organization around industry partners and that sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=793)|
| 0:13:21| So they're really kind of viewed, ACTE is the big CTE group in the country that kind of does professional development and advocacy and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=801)|
| 0:13:29| and they're currently working even with them around the work of establishing career academies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| and the national and international schools are an example of one of their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| They have 40 plus communities in the United States, and even in the UK they have communities that are doing that work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| but ACTE leans in heavily with them, which is how I got exposed to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| Honestly, knowing kind of that was the direction we were heading, much of the work they do aligned to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| and so I kind of came back and was talking with John and them, actually not even knowing that Nashville was an example at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=835)|
| 0:14:02| So fast forward to where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| This year we've had the opportunity to take a few school teams to visit Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| and sort of look at the academy models and look at what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| Best far, that's been Hardin Valley, Fulton High School, and Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| and then we're planning another one in March where Halls High School will be going with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| So really that initial kind of just picture of it and what the structure is, plus this visit is sort of that first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| Ford really looks at the communities to see what the assets are that are there in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=871)|
| 0:14:38| We really emphasize the importance of partnership with the CTE work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| and that's really what their business is, is about organizing around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| and then really looking at how that influence from business and industry into the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| can then become part of the fabric of the academic focus and the CTE focus in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| And so they do that work and they come in and at the end of that visit sort of capture and give a report back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| and really talk about would Ford be a good fit to help support your community in this work or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| So that's really the nature of what you see before you doesn't have a lot of that next stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| because this is sort of the dating phase is actually how they refer to it in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| So there's the possibility after the first phase of then deciding is it a good match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| and should we go forward with the further steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Absolutely, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| And I would add one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| So again as we've gone and looked at like Nashville as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| they're 10 years plus into this work and they started their work with this in a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=928)|
| 0:15:35| where they were graduating about 50% of their students from high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| and it was a huge sort of red flag moment that they went we've got to do something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| We're very fortunate in this community to not be in that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| And so I say all that to say this is not a rinse and repeat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| we're going to do what every other community has done sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| They really do come in and try to look at your community and your needs and your schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| and find out again what are the assets we can build upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| And so we've already been engaged in talking with our Knoxville chamber about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| We've talked to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| We actually have representatives from both of those entities that are going to participate with us in the visit in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| To go and see and we'll have some time to kind of connect with Metro Nashville's counterparts in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| So again it's a really big lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| And so we just go through this first phase to kind of see where things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| Not of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Thank you so much Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Did you have a question on seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| No, not seven, on five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| Five, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| So is anybody here to talk about the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| Dr. Reislich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| John, are you the one to talk about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Mr. Norman, I can probably answer some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| And some of the funding structures will be public affairs and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| But yeah, I can speak to the process if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| And sorry to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| For some reason I couldn't open up any of the attachments on this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| So I've got a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| My only question here is it says donated funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| What are those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| So I'll take a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| And Ms. Harrington, if you want to jump in to help out, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| So we do the principal institute every year in the summer and bring in for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| bring in speakers and then as well as have local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| Our presenters present for that too, kind of professional development for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| A couple years ago was to bring in keynote speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| A committee was formed that had teachers and principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| and some of our district staff involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| And so they vet the different folks based on what the theme will be for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| And so this person was chosen for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| And my understanding is that typically public affairs donations from outside the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| come in to fund that through our public affairs department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| So who is public affairs department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| Ms. Harrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| I'm just not familiar with the structure or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| We work with departments within central office to host different events throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| And so one of the things that we do is try to secure sponsorship dollars from our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1095)|
| 0:18:23| and business partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| And so that's when we say donated funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| That's really what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| So this could be a variety of sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| It's not just one source?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| Typically it's more than one sponsorship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| I do have a question about seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| You want to go ahead and read it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| What is your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| About seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| I just want to know the money side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| On Tremont?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| So the money side of Tremont programs, there is a student fee or a fee based on the per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1141)|
| 0:19:11| student or per teacher as well cost for the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| Most of those, that fee is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Who are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| My name is David Reedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| I'm a community development specialist with Tremont Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| If you'll hold, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| So what was exactly your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Is that what you needed to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| Financials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| We just didn't know you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| I was unable to get any of the physical stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| And so I'm just trying to understand what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| So the way Tremont Institute operates, there is a cost per person for school programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1189)|
| 0:19:57| Most of that cost is generally paid by student families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| Tremont Institute does give out around $150,000 in scholarships each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| with a priority being that scholarship money going to local schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| such as Blount County, Knox County, Sevier County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| And that scholarship funding can cover up to 25% of the program cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| In addition, we work with outside sponsorship partners, businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| foundations, et cetera, to try and alleviate the cost for local school partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| to try and make sure that there is equitable access to our programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| and education opportunities in the Smoky Mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| So this is a five-year work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Can I, Mr. Norman, if we can just turn it over to Mr. Duplo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| because this is actually a form agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| So probably Mr. Duplo can help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Mr. Reedy, for giving that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| But, yes, Mr. Norman, what this is is, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| this has been done in the past by individual schools, and it's just come up piecemeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| I mean, each time a school wants to take a field trip to Tremont,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| then sometimes they've gotten the scholarship that Mr. Reedy talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| or sometimes it comes from, you know, a field trip fee or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| But it's usually from the school itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| It's not district funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| And what we're asking the board to do is to have a form agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| That way, for the next five years, you know, a principal at a school can say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| hey, the third grade wants to take a trip, and, you know, let's put that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| And if they get a scholarship, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| But if not, they'll need to collect the fees at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| But that's how that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| So, essentially, this will sort of speed up the process, make it a little more efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| less paperwork, et cetera, for each individual school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| And one of the reasons that we were doing this is because we had gotten feedback from individual schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| in Knox County saying that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| getting onto individual board meeting agendas on a school-by-school basis was one of those barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| and added burdens for teachers and administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| And so, hopefully, getting this approval would just allow schools to move forward with their programming easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1334)|
| 0:22:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| And awesome organization, all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| You know, just wanted to ask about some of the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Happy to provide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Did I meet you at Middle Palm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Yes, I met you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| We were swimming one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| That's about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Y'all should join us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| It's a great place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| My question is for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| When we do a form agreement, is there a sunset on that when a future board would have to look at it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| Or is it a, how long does it last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| So we normally put five years on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| So, I mean, and that's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| So the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| After five years, then the board at that time would need to take another look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| and could easily extend it if things haven't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| But, you know, in five years, a lot of times there's tweaks and amendments to an agreement that you might want to look at anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| Any other questions on seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Any other questions on eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| Ms. Owen, your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| Ten or 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| Questions on 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Moving into board policies, anything on A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Could we read the revised, the revisions of the policy on both of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1438)|
| 0:24:05| I just couldn't pull them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| I'll, Mr. Dupler, would you like to discuss the portion that you added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| Or I think that's the only addition that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| Can you pull it up, Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Maybe on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| The naming one, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| So, board, just while they're pulling that up, I think that we discussed in policy review these policies last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| and so we've added a naming committee, and that's the verbiage that's been added on lines six through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1473)|
| 0:24:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Ms. Owen is helping me over here, and she's doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Yeah, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| It looks like you've got it pulled up now, Mr. Norman, but that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| So we were asked to add a paragraph to the naming facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| The suggestions that were in lines three and four about the removal of the name requiring board approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1502)|
| 0:25:12| that was already in there, and then at the end of the, this was in policy review committee, I'm sorry, policy review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1512)|
| 0:25:21| After that meeting, we were asked to add the language from line six to 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| which talks about a naming facilities committee made up of three board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| which would be named by the chair of the board in the exact same fashion as all the committees are named by the board chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1532)|
| 0:25:42| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| I just wanted to take a look at the revisions on the second policy also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1544)|
| 0:25:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Did anyone else have questions on this policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| I'm looking at on the final lines 27 through 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1561)|
| 0:26:10| That gives me pause because, mainly because I don't want to miss out on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1570)|
| 0:26:22| If we have someone that is perhaps still teaching and also the field of education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1582)|
| 0:26:32| that I would assume goes into higher ed and that type of thing also, that might still be active or on an interim basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1592)|
| 0:26:44| or even in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| If, for example, a renowned senator wanted to donate, you know, to one of our schools that was perhaps still in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1606)|
| 0:27:02| this to me is indicating we cannot acknowledge that person by naming the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1622)|
| 0:27:10| I just, I'm a little bit concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| I don't want us to cut off her nose, you know, so that's my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Thank you, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| Mr. Norman, would you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| Nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Any other comments on that portion of the policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1652)|
| 0:27:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| Ms. Hill, if you want to think about other verbiage that you would offer, you could always offer a substitute motion next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1667)|
| 0:27:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| We're moving on to policy J191.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| Ms. Hill, your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| Did you have a question on 191?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| We're moving on to grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| A question on A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| Mr. Wilson, since you're here, can you just give us a quick rundown about the STEM startup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1718)|
| 0:28:45| what that entails for Hardin Valley, and it's all Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1725)|
| 0:28:54| If you don't mind, I may actually have Laura Denton do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| She and Christy Seals, actually, who's our college and career specialist, did most of the labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Hey, I'm Laura Denton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| I'm the grants manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| So Hardin Valley Middle got two different grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| The STEM startup grant is, as you can see in what you have, primarily equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| It's actually 100 percent equipment, and that will be used for a STEM night in the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| and then be used in their STEM coursework beginning in the fall and going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| The CTE startup grant is actually for transportation and substitute teachers to take all of the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1765)|
| 0:29:33| of course those that have parental permission, to visit colleges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| So, Pellissippi, Tennessee, TCAT, UT, so on and so forth, possibly LMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1777)|
| 0:29:45| They're still working all those details out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| And also to visit some local businesses such as Denso, ORNL, the Megalab at UT, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| And so that would allow at least one field trip for 6th, 7th, and 8th grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Any other questions while she's here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Any questions on E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| G?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Moving into contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| Questions on A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| Yes, if somebody just could talk a little bit about what this is going to allow the schools to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| I'm thinking it's what some of my parents have been asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| so I just think a little bit better explanation of it would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| Mr. Oaks, did you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| What this will do is give us a consistent visitor management system in all of our schools across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| And Chief Producers have been working on it with a committee of folks for the last number of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| And I'd let him talk about the details and the process that he's gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Thanks, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| In our communications with our schools and our principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| visitor management problems and processes were continually discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| And so many of our schools asked us to help develop a visitor management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| And so we were fortunate enough to get a community-oriented policing services grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| and we were able to budget $144,000 to put a visitor management system in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1873)|
| 0:31:20| And really what it is is when visitors come in, they'll be able to log in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| The system will print out a visitor badge with their name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| a current photo, a date and a time, and the purpose for their visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| And one of the things that the vendor will provide is a daily update of the Tennessee and the National Sex Offender Registry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1894)|
| 0:31:41| And so if you come into your school and you register and you're a member of the Sex Offender Registry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| it will immediately identify you as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| And then there will be protocols in place to address those kinds of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| And then our trespass database, because we have automated it over the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| we'll be able to push that database into the visitor management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| And so if you are not allowed on campus due to a misconduct issue, that will also alert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| The system will be able to send text messages to designated school personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| to include the school security officer, our law enforcement partners, designated school personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| And if you deem it necessary, you can even send a text message to 911 that will alert them to some kind of problem inside your school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1942)|
| 0:32:31| And then you can do customizable reports to track your parental visits, your vendors, your contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| and anybody else that visits your school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| And you can track your volunteers and volunteer hours and those type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| I've had parents that had seen these at other schools or come from other school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| and I know had been wanting something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| And the driver's license is what they must have to check in, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| They don't have to have a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Now, one of the things that this system allows is you will have a scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| And so if you have a government-issued ID with a barcode, you will scan the barcode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| In the absence of the driver's license, most of the schools do require some identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| And then the first visit that you have to the school, you will have staff-assisted check-in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=1998)|
| 0:33:26| where a member of the staff will help you check in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| And then once you become a known, approved visitor, then that check-in process is even quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| But you'll have a scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| And if you have an ID that has a barcode, which is typically a driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| that is the preferred method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| And then one unique feature of this system is it will take your picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| And so to where some systems pull the picture off your driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| this system will actually take your picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| So if you're visiting a school today, the photo that will be placed on your visitor badge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| is a picture of what you look like the day you visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| So you don't have to have a driver's license to gain entry any more than you do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| Okay. I think Mr. Norman's light was on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thanks, Gus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| Talk about the money again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| We allocated $144,000 for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| And it's part of a grant that we received about a year and a half ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| through the COPS office in Washington and COPS is Community Oriented Policing Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| We actually got about $288,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| And so we allocated about $144,000 to fund the visitor management system in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2077)|
| 0:34:44| And this particular vendor, iMetric Identity Systems, came in at about $109,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2084)|
| 0:34:52| And they had a lot of things that met the requirements of the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| And so they are the chosen vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| But this is all grant dollars that's paying for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| For each year, we'll have grant dollars each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| No, sir. The grant dollars will fund the $109,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| And then each year there is a cost of $325 per school per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2111)|
| 0:35:19| And that equals between $28,000 and $29,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| And we don't anticipate grant funds being able to pay for that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| But it could very well pay for it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| We anticipate some combination of district funds and school-based funds to pay the renewal fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2131)|
| 0:35:39| Okay. So more than likely it's going to be $28,000 to $30,000 out of our budget each year afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| In the absence of the grant, it will either be district budget or school-based funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| Okay. When we talked about visitor management in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| what was the problem? Are we having big problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| I don't understand why this is, you know, why is it needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| Yes, sir. There were probably at least a third to a half of our schools that listed visitor management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| as a process that we would like to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| And what an automated system does is it does check for sex offender registry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| It does check for whether or not you're on the criminal trespass database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| And before, those systems were not in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| And so there was a high degree of human error that was possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| And now that process is automated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| And the visitor check-in system traditionally is you go in, you sign a roster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| and you get a pass to place on your chest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| This process, the badge will be printed off. Your picture will be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| It will have a date and a time. It will have a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| And then when you check out, you come out of the visitor management system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| but we're able to develop reports to track basically the comings and goings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| And so the opportunity for human error is dramatically reduced in an automated system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| Okay. I can see how that screening process would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| Have we identified situations where people such as you've described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| sex offenders, et cetera, have slipped through into schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| Well, I cannot detail specific examples, but I think there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| I think it's reasonable to assume that on occasion sex offenders do come onto our campuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| and we don't know that they are sex offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| There are rules about what sex offenders have to do and when they can come on campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| but by the very nature of a sex offender, they are not known to be rule followers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| And so in the absence of them notifying us, which they are required to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| and then us managing when they can come onto campus and when they cannot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| I feel comfortable saying we probably have sex offenders that come onto our campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| that we probably don't know about, and so this will eliminate that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| If you could kind of describe the training process that goes into anybody that's on any type of list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| and they get the notification, how is the training handled to ensure that the people that maybe front desk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2310)|
| 0:38:39| or whoever is at the desk knows the proper protocol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| What does that training look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| This vendor will pay a visit to each and every school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| and do one-on-one training with designated staff on how to manage the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| and then additionally they will help us draft our protocol based on best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| in terms of their experience in other jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| But one of the good pieces about this vendor is they will do on-site training one-on-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2343)|
| 0:39:10| and they will visit every school in our district with a team of individuals that will coach our folks up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2350)|
| 0:39:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| I would like to see the protocol that you all draft of the training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| because my biggest concern is that whatever list that they might find themselves on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2363)|
| 0:39:32| be it that it happened maybe 20, 50 years ago, that they're still treated with human dignity as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| and so that's my biggest concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| This will never replace common courtesies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| Ms. Edwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Does the system use any existing computer hardware or is it all provided by iMetric?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| Some of the hardware will be either provided by the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| or we have the option of purchasing some hardware from the vendor or purchasing it from other sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2398)|
| 0:40:05| and because the vendor came in at $109,000 and we allocated $144,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2405)|
| 0:40:12| we have a little bit of a cushion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| As long as we spend that money directly for visitor management-related issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| we'll be able to use some of those extra dollars to help fund any hardware gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| They do provide software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| They provide a camera, a scanner, and a printer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| and there are some hardware needs that they provide, but you have to purchase those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| and then we have a lot of resources internally that we'll use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| Do we have any idea about the lifespan of their system and their hardware?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| How replaceable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| How often do we need to replace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| We do know that we will run out of badges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| and they give us so many thousands of badges on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| but it literally is just a paper badge, and once we get the initial supply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| which, again, is several thousand, we'll replenish those ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| The printer is very inexpensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| We anticipate the camera and the scanner having a several-year lifespan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| and I think this initial contract with this vendor is good for five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| and we're comfortable that the hardware should last that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| Hi, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| How many, and just roughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| how many adults would you say that we send the letters to each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| forbidding them from coming on school property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| Yes, ma'am, and I'm working for memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| but I think last year we probably sent between 30 and 40 criminal trespass letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2516)|
| 0:42:04| which forbids an individual from coming onto any campus within our system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| and then we probably send a comparable number of civility letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| which is just what it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| We send them a copy of the Board of Education Civility Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| and we draw attention to the fact that they were disrupted to the educational process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| and we ask them not to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| So a civility letter is typically our first option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| but in years past we've just kept a paper file of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| so it's a little bit less than ideal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| and then the trespass letters, like I said, 30 to 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| and they typically are system-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| They are not school-specific, and they do not expire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| but because a couple of years ago we automated that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| we have a database now that we can check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| We anticipate being able to marry our database and the new visitor management system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| so that when you go to a school and you plug your name and date of birth in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| or you scan your driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| that that criminal database will alert just like the sex offender database will alert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| So of these 30 or 40 people that are banned from campuses every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| right now how does the school know if this person is on that list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| I think in the short term it's easy because any time we do a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| if we do a trespass letter, someone from security signs it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| and then we also ask that the principal signs it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| and then we always have a copy that we send to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| We always send a copy to our school security officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| So in the short term, that school year and maybe the next school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| if nothing changes, we are able to track that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| But if you get a new principal, if you get a new security officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| if you get a new secretary, then the trickiest part is that sometimes you forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| And so this automated system will take some of the guesswork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| and some of the burden of trying to keep track of it just as a human being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| and the automated process will take some of that off of us who just try to remember it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| Has that been a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| You know, if you do 40 a year and they don't ever expire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| and unfortunately we do issue some to parents who have elementary school-aged children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| and so you could have somebody that's going to be on the trespass letter for 8 or 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| And just like the sex offender issue, my guess is occasionally somebody comes on a school campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| and they have a trespass letter, but maybe nobody at the school knows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| And so that is a problem just like the sex offender issue can be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| And to your knowledge on the sex offender issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| do we have adults that are on the register that have been in our schools that have created problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2700)|
| 0:45:10| I mean, is that something we deal with on a regular basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| I wouldn't say we deal with it on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| I can vaguely remember one or two conversations with a school about a particular sex offender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2716)|
| 0:45:24| and maybe the principal has some information that they feel like they would like to use some discretion with the sex offender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2724)|
| 0:45:33| And the reality is school principal or security personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| there's very well-defined limits on when a sex offender can visit campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| and we don't have any discretion to impact that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| And we know we've had one or two examples where a principal trying to do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| but maybe exercises a little bit of discretion when they probably shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| And so there again, it will take all the guesswork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| Mr. Oaks, did you want to add something to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| I did, and I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| I think it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| I think the real value of this system is it gives us some consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| and ability to look at something every time somebody comes into the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| and signs in for whatever reason, and we don't have that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| This will allow us to look and see, you know, what your issues might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| And, you know, do we have sex offenders on our campuses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| Yes, because we have parents who are sex offenders, and we have to manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| And those, you know, we think we're fairly aware of, but maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2799)|
| 0:46:46| And the issue with trespass letters goes back to the long duration of a trespass letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2806)|
| 0:46:53| And if I received a trespass letter for an incident that occurred in School A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| the folks in School A for an extended period are going to remember that and know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| and enforce that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| But I may have kids that are in School B, C, and D or matriculate to School B, C, and D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| and the folks in those schools don't necessarily have an awareness of that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| And if we issue a criminal no trespass letter, there is, you know, some level of thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2836)|
| 0:47:25| that we will enforce that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| And if we don't enforce those letters, then that becomes problematic in itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| should we ever, you know, find ourselves in court over one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| in our enforcement, that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| I'm wondering, is this policing grant, what's the source of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| Is that some of Governor Lee's allotment that he was putting towards security?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| The monies that are paying for the visitor management system are federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| through the COPS office, which is under the umbrella of the Department of Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| And so they are federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| I don't object to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| I just know that sometimes when the parameters are very narrow about how you can spend grant money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2892)|
| 0:48:19| that I just don't want this to be a reach because we have the money and we need to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2899)|
| 0:48:30| And I don't mean that, I promise I don't mean that negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| but I'm trying to be just very careful about anything more that we might add to the plate of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2914)|
| 0:48:42| And this is something that I just hope doesn't end up being a real headache for our school offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2922)|
| 0:48:52| and our secretaries and volunteers that man the offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| That type of thing just is really my only concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| given the fact that I'm not hearing that this kind of trespassing is really a presenting problem to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2942)|
| 0:49:12| Well, can I address that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| We have several schools that have used these and like them and several schools that have them and want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2956)|
| 0:49:24| And the schools have been reaching out and going to different vendors and picking up different products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| And we looked at it and said, particularly when the schools did their annual security assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| like Gus said, many of them identified this as being something that they wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| And when we got all that back, Gus and I talked about it, and I looked at them and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| if we don't get in front of this and help the schools with this, they're all going to do their own thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| and then we're going to have something out there that we can't manage and can't control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| So that's what we want to do is offer them all a very functional, robust system that is something that they were seeking in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=2995)|
| 0:50:03| So this is not something we're doing just because we had the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| This is something that really we went back in and retooled our grant request in order to be able to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3006)|
| 0:50:14| Okay, good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| I can sure accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| I just have a quick question, and this isn't really specific to iMetric, but just for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| on the no trespass letters, I'm thinking cumulatively, is that 30 to 40 new ones each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| or are those 30 to 40 that are active in that year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| The 30 to 40 references new ones that we do every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| So this year we'll do between 30 and 40, and next year we'll do 30 to 40 new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| And if I could address Ms. Hill's question, I think this is the same system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| or really similar to what they used at the Capitol several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| It's been a long time, but it was really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| So it just printed it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| It's not a high-quality photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| It just printed really quickly in sticker and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| We understand that the, because time is an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| and we were real sensitive to putting more on the front office staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| They estimate, and we've seen it demonstrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| that a first-time self-entry or a staff-assisted entry should take about 25 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3089)|
| 0:51:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| Ms. Sutterfield, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Any other questions on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| Thank you, Gus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| Contract B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Moving on to regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| We have A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| Any questions on A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| Ms. Padd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| The only question I had, honestly, from the schematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| I couldn't tell anything from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| So I guess, is it just a bridge over, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| maybe I just don't know how to read schematics, and it was kind of small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| It's a bridge over Tipton Station Road that joins both campuses of South Doran High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3144)|
| 0:52:33| And Mr. Dillingham has been working on the details of this with the school administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| and the engineering firm involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| And I'd like to let him talk a little bit about the specific design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| And I will tell you that Mr. Greg Green from Robert Campbell is in the audience tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| if there are any questions that I'm unable to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| But we have taken a look at this and gone through several iterations of the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| And I think originally you'll remember that they submitted a report on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| that was included with our capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| And at that time we were talking about maybe doing something like what is down here on Malan Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| where you have an elevator on one side and a ramp on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| which we had a design like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| And then started thinking, well, that design elevator is for special needs folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3206)|
| 0:53:33| For the kids that use it every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| they would have to climb somewhere in the neighborhood of 35 to 40 steps to get up to the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3215)|
| 0:53:42| So we decided that that wouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| And Ms. Christie agreed with me that her kids probably wouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| They'd find a shortcut around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| So we started having a conversation about the bridge being a prefabricated system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3232)|
| 0:54:00| and to actually cross Tipton Station Road and on the main campus just using that same type system to ramp down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3240)|
| 0:54:10| And what that does is allows us to kind of steer the kids onto the bridge a lot closer to the main building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3250)|
| 0:54:21| That they're usually exiting from to go to the young campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| And so we felt like that that was a much better design to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| So if you have specific questions, I'll be happy to answer those now or afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3270)|
| 0:54:39| I think I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| I think I just I'm not the greatest at reading plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| Thank you, Mr. Dillingham and Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| And I believe Mr. Dillingham also had a conversation with our administrators the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3287)|
| 0:54:54| And they really like this design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| And I spoke with them after and they thought that it would be better as far as getting the students channeled into the bridge and the walkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3297)|
| 0:55:10| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Moving on to C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| I just want to reiterate something that we have discussed in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| While we definitely have a need for incentives to bring in new teachers in hard to staff areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3328)|
| 0:55:38| It is very frustrating to those teachers who've been with us for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| So if we could look at that and consider something to also incentivize those folks who are really doing great with us to stay, that might help also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3343)|
| 0:55:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| Mr. Horman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| And along those same lines, who would I ask a question of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| Mr. McPherson or Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| Oh, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| It's a difficult job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| It's hard to stay with this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| So how is the retention plan working to help those who are in the job stay in the job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3376)|
| 0:56:24| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Mr. Bolton, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| Madam Chair, the rest of the board, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| Thank you for the opportunity to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| When we're looking at this pilot, we looked at it at a year at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| So we're really looking at this potential for retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| So I couldn't tell you the numbers that took it out the first year that will be back next year until at the end of the school year to see if they stayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3399)|
| 0:56:48| And so our recommendation, the $7,000 is to be paid out over three years so that way it has a retention feel to it so that the first year they get $3,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3408)|
| 0:57:00| second year they get $2,000, the next year they get $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| If they leave after year one, they'll only have gotten $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| If they leave after year two, they will have gotten $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| So we're recommending adding another year pilot to that to look at it so that we can examine the retention to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3431)|
| 0:57:22| For the purpose of comparison, I looked back on January the 10th of 2019 to look at the number of vacancies that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3442)|
| 0:57:31| At that point done, we had 54 total teaching vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| A year later on the 10th of this year, we had 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| So we went down from 54 to 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| When we're talking about particularly special ed vacancies that this impacts, we had 14 on January 11th of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3464)|
| 0:57:52| On January the 10th of 2020, we had two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| So it was successful in getting those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| We included in part of this adding the speech and language pathologist to the $5,000 sign-up bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3480)|
| 0:58:09| We hadn't otherwise considered them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Last year we had two vacancies on January the 11th of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| This year we don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| So I think that we, in looking at a year, I think we could say that it pretty much was a success in terms of filling some of those hard-to-staff positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3498)|
| 0:58:26| But I think there's still a question about the retention component to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| My question is not really about the money side of the retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| It's about the teachers with experience that have been in there for a while and beyond three or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3516)|
| 0:58:46| And what's the rate at which we're retaining those teachers that are not going to receive any money from, you know, this type of plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3526)|
| 0:58:56| Are we still losing teachers under, you know, with five years, six years experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3536)|
| 0:59:03| Because of teaching conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| I'm talking about conditions in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| I would agree that when we're looking at special educators, that is a difficult job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| My wife is a special educator, so I hear about it quite a bit and really have an appreciation for the nature of the job that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3554)|
| 0:59:22| We really haven't looked at it particularly to look at how long they stay with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| But that is certainly something that we can look into, and I think that needs to be something that we look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| I would recommend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| Ms. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Do we have any data from those special ed teachers who have taken the incentive that says that it is the money that was the incentive to stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3580)|
| 0:59:50| or that it could be another circumstance like the culture change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| We do collect exit interviews, so we do have exit data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| But a lot of these, of course, that's not going to flash out until the end of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| So we will have an opportunity to kind of analyze and to look at those things from that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| But on the front end, we don't necessarily collect data on the front end to determine whether or not the money had any kind of pull to their acceptance of the job or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3610)|
| 1:00:20| So we don't have stay data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| We only have exit data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| Could we maybe have REA look at a possibility of a survey for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| We could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| If those are the factors, or if there are other factors, or maybe a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| I think that would be useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| Okay, moving on to D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| Ms. Owen, did you have a question on D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| The date it says it's entered into is January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| Will that still say January, or will it say February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| Mr. Oaks, would you like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| We can adjust the date on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| I think that's just when the draft was completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| But we can adjust the date depending on whenever the board approves this, assuming the board does approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| Any other questions on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| We do not have anything attached on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| So do we have any update on that, Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| I can update the board on two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| One, our office has worked with Attorney Mark Mamentoff, who, of course, handles the bond issues for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3703)|
| 1:01:53| and we have together been able to go through the proper process and send questions to the Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3713)|
| 1:02:05| We're back from the Attorney General at this point, but we're at that stage in that particular process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3725)|
| 1:02:12| Secondly, a proposed memorandum of agreement was sent to our office yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| and we were able to make some revisions and send that back to Mr. Mamentoff today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3739)|
| 1:02:27| So that's the latest I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| Any questions for Mr. Dupler on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| And now we'll move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| There is no one signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| Thank you, Ms. Mabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| So we'll move to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| Mr. Kelly, would you like to go first this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| Yes, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| So the Knox County, the whole county-wide PSA anti-vaping contest is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| It's well underway, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| I just wanted to remind all the schools that the deadline is the 21st of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| It's a one- to three-minute PSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| There's an example on the KnoxSchools.org website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| If you scroll down towards the bottom, there's a vape-free Knoxville logo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| and you can click on that, and it will take you to the page with all of the different details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| So all the different winners, there's a first, second, and third place prize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| along with getting a substantial cash reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| Your video will also be posted on the Knox County Schools website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| and shown at the May 6 Smokies baseball game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| in addition to some other rewards that haven't been released yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| If you have any questions, you can feel free to email me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| or the supervisor of the PSA program, which is Ramona Duke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| But all of that information can be found on the KnoxSchools.org website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| Today was signing day, so congratulations to all our Knox County scholars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| that signed their way to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| Ms. Fadden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboardws4178200302feb05?start=3830)|
