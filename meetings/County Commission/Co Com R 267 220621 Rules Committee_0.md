| 0:01:31| First by Commissioner Jay, second by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| All opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| Item number four is the first one, and that is mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| I think I apologize. I'll have to call on the co-chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=106)|
| 0:01:53| First time I put on there was discussion of consideration of any late additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=113)|
| 0:02:00| Did you, Mr. Vice Chair, did you discuss that last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| It says so in some of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=124)|
| 0:02:13| Nothing came of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=133)|
| 0:02:20| I put that one on there because we seem to be getting a lot of late additions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| and I know it's a two-thirds vote by our rules and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| We've had a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| The sheriff's one comes to mind recently that it had to be on the agenda, had to be on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| and we got it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| A month later, it was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| To me, an addition is something that is financial, something that has to be heard that month because of finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=163)|
| 0:02:53| Not everything should be a rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| I'd have put it on there, but that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| I'll open it up for any discussions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| Mr. Long-Rick, we're seeing you loud and clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| Was that an accident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| I think when our discussion, if I just remember last time we had a rules committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| we went through this and I think we found two or three instances in our rules already that explains late additions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=198)|
| 0:03:26| and what the process is, and ultimately a lot falls to the chairman to be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=206)|
| 0:03:34| if it's being abused by a particular department or it's a constant thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| they sort of have the first check and balance to sort of say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| no, we're not going to add this at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| And then if for some reason it really gets pushed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| then the commission as a whole can say at the very beginning of our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| no, we're not going to add this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| We'll push it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| And then even pulling from non-consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| it was a third check that I think even a commissioner could say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| this is a late add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| I'm going to move to send this back 30 days because it's just not enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| So there were multiple checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| They don't very often get used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| But I think the discussion was sort of if we felt like it was being egregiously abused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| that we have the mechanisms in place to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| It just doesn't always end up that we push on that as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| So I'm just trying to remember the last time we had that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| I think we sort of said we've got it, but we just don't use it very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=272)|
| 0:04:39| The issue that I have with, the only issue really that I have with it is that it's a late add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| A lot of times the information is not added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| You know, we're going to say we're going to add this to workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| and then you click for the view for the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| There's no paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Well, we'll get that to you next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| You know, and that's the part I don't like is that if you've got an add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| you need to have all your paperwork ready for us or workshop to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| That's my biggest issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| I absolutely hear what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=312)|
| 0:05:19| especially about things that are added that there's no referencing materials on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=319)|
| 0:05:26| Sometimes, and again, I don't know that it's being abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=326)|
| 0:05:34| Maybe it is, and I just have not paid that close of attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| But a lot of times the delays are administrated in that it just got stuck on somebody's desk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=339)|
| 0:05:47| or someone overlooked it or someone was out sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| You know, things that really weren't anybody's fault, per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=352)|
| 0:06:01| and most of the time the department heads don't call that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| because they don't want to embarrass, you know, whoever might have dropped the ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| So I do think it's important that we're, I guess, sensitive to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=372)|
| 0:06:19| Having said that, have you noticed that it seems to be one particular department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| or area or anything that is a constant offender?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=385)|
| 0:06:33| I'll go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| I don't think one department is abusing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| It's just that I wish that once they come and we do an ad and I'll ask the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=399)|
| 0:06:46| and future chairmen that if you're going to add something to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| get us the information with that ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| I know Rose Department, they have to add something because of financials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| you know, waiting on the contract or whatever, and then finance department, same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| I understand all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| But some of us, all of us, would like to see that information in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| so we can click on that and say, well, we'll have it to you next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| Next Monday is meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| We need to review that and see what all that information is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| before we come on the commission meeting and have to discuss it in the open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| where we didn't get to do any research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| That's my biggest issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| But I can say I agree with Commissioner Jay that we do have checks and balances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| but I will ask the chairman and future chairmen to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| hey, if we're going to do an ad, get your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| Drew, any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| You're the one that's basically you and Jill are the ones that run the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| I do think it is a good idea to require them to provide documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| because sometimes it's like pulling teeth for me and Jill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| to get the documentation we need in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| We just got to, I don't think it's a problem, but I think we could do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| I remember some time ago when I first got on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| when something was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| It was brought forth as a separate item and it wasn't voted on as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| But you did have to have a vote on it, I think, of two-thirds to add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=514)|
| 0:08:42| We never do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| It's only a roll call vote or we approve the agenda as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| and kind of let that slip by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| And the process here is that you really need to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| and, like you say, study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| That's our job is to look at these things that are brought before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| and if it's brought there and we only have a certain length of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| we're not doing our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| And we're letting people dictate the way we run our meeting by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| So if you're going to have it, let's do it like it's supposed to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| and like it was done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| For some reason, we just kind of let these things slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| and they get real easy to grab things to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| And they should be voted on separately by a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| Put it on the agenda if we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| I don't think our rules, what I've read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| our rules does not call for a separate vote, but I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| I think I've made the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| I think if you add an item, it ought to be on a separate vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| And it's recorded as a separate vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| And I think tonight we have one for sure, maybe two ads tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| And that's the chair can do that without a rule change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=591)|
| 0:10:01| It doesn't say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| It seemed like when I first got off here, they would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| And I was amazed at the amount of processing they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| And then for some reason it got slid around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=613)|
| 0:10:21| Mr. J., you've, I'll call this a cheat book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| You had the book there that goes down through there and helps you proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| Was there anything there in the beginning that you've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| that says additions to be voted on first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| No, it was always as part of the total overall agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| It was just marked as a to-be-added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| There was never, there's nothing in there that specifies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| it has to be a separate vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| And so for brevity, what I found was most of the times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| the to-be-addeds were contractual things that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| if delayed another 30 days would sort of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| it was all about, when I looked at it, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| would this hold up the wheels of government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| You know, would this hold up the ability for people to do their job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| I don't think I ever saw it as some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| I never saw anybody sort of maliciously trying to slide things in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| I know that several times, like honorary resolutions or things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| like I just wouldn't hit the deadline, it'd be a day after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| And fortunately our staff is so diligent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| Even as the chairman, Drew would be like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| sorry, you missed the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| I got to put it as a to-be-added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| And so I would get it in the day after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| but it would be marked as to-be-added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| only because I just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| I wasn't prepared to sort of stick it all in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| So I just didn't find it to be too egregious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| and there certainly wasn't a mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| But I think a simple, if you wanted to down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| put something together, a simple rule change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| could be just anything that doesn't make the agenda deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| is do it as a separate vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| But make sure you're ready to have a separate part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| of the agenda that goes, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| we're going to vote on the consent agenda, this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| like we're going to vote on the to-be-adds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| and then set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| So you'll have an extra step to go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| Wouldn't take much more than a few minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| but it might call out, you know, specificity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| I don't think that kind of rule change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| would make a fundamental difference, plus or minus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| but I don't think anybody would object to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| I'll research this more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| and I'll get with Chairman Beeler and see what he thinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| Tonight you'll see he'll go deferred, withdrawn, to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=746)|
| 0:12:34| It would not be, it's just a simple motion to accept the adds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| And a voice vote, well, yeah, it'd be a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| Because he can tell by if it's two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| I'll follow up with the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| I think it's important what you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| as far as adding the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| just have that documented even if the information is not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| but just whoever's adding it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| just say something about the documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| will be coming on this day or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| just for a historical record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| we don't want people to look at our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| When I was on BZA, we've had a lot of applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| who missed a deadline, and they wanted to be added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| and we finally said, that's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| Deadline's the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| You missed a deadline, that's your fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| And guess what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| They made sure they got the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| It didn't take but one or two, and they got the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| All right, well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| We'll follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| Item number five, discussions and considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| set rules for beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| I just handed out, it's the one that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| it's actually our rules for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| We have no rules in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| It says application attendance required for action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| I should have redlined it, but I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| We could go through where it says the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| I suggest that the commission acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| that beer board used to do decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| that affect property rights and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| All we have to do to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| is where it says zoning for beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| and then we got a process in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| to where if an applicant's not present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| it's moved to the back of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| If they're still not here at the back of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| it's moved to the following month's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| with our great clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| our group, whoever it is, send out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| Say, hey, you need to be at the next month's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| and that really gives them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| they'll come in and that gives them three chances to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| They know that they missed the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| and they better be here for the next one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| unless they call for a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| So I think our zoning is working well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| and we can always suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| if we ever have to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| We all got that safeguard called suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| So just for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| you're not seeing a particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| but you're seeing that in our rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| we really don't have a mechanism for what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| if they're not here like we do in other cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| so we might as well kind of clean it up and add one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| so that we have a consistency in our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Yeah, I don't see any issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| It gives a step process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| although what we usually find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| is that people don't miss more than one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| because they can't sell beer until they get their permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| so they have an incentive to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| But I would be happy to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| an actual motion out of this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| even though the language isn't exactly right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| knowing that it's pretty darn close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| to come out of this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| that would then hit the agenda next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| that would have a similar written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| unless you want to wait for the actual language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| But I think the intent is pretty clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| to just have a mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| and you're not really changing the game too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| So I'd be happy to support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| if somebody wants to head that through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| Mr. Lawbrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| Since Jill isn't here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| are you wanting to do a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| amending section H here, adding the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| or what is it exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| Yeah, I would sponsor a motion to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| I'd support a motion to basically duplicate section 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| and add that to our beer board rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| as a recommendation out of this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| obviously changing the language of land use to beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| and essentially saying that it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| acknowledges that the beer board decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| affect health and welfare of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| as it relates to safety, public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| and, you know, we encourage everybody to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| and just substituting any adaptive language that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| but keeping the same nature of the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| Jill is probably watching this, so she probably is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| Is that a good enough motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| Is that a good, vague enough motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| Obviously it's just a recommendation out of this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| so it's still final language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| would be a problem for both commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| As Commissioner Jay says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| it's just a clean-up to make sure that we do in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| we all know what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| but we've got, what do we have, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| three, four new ones maybe coming on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| And I have to stat the count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| It will help them, and hopefully they will read these rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| and they'll know what the rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| They'll know that if Mr. Biggs is a resolution passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| that we've got the fine set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| 500,000, 2,000, whatever, they know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| And we just don't go off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| well, that's what we've been doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| well, now we know what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| So if you'll make that in the form of a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| it is in the motion, and I need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| All right, we have a motion by Commissioner Jasek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| to copy the zoning steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1099)|
| 0:18:29| and move it into the beer section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| Beer board rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Beer board rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| And I'll get with Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| I guarantee you she'll get with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| And we'll have it cleaned up for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| It's just simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| All right, I have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| Just some cleanup stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| Item six, discussion and consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| of any Knox County Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| cannot serve on any committee, board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| or appointed position with any family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| To me, that's kind of common sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| but that is on section A, rules committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1159)|
| 0:19:32| this piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| Under rules, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| I added in red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| any commissioner shall not serve on any committee or board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| that has a family member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| parenthesis, family tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| on said committee or board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| I don't know if we've had that problem in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| but I'm just trying to clear something up in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| And I call a family member family tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| If you're a grandfather and it comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| and you're serving on the same board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| and your second cousin is serving on that same board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| that's not cultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| That's what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| Is there a problem we're trying to solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| or is there an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| or something that we're worried about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| Whenever we get to the rules committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| I'm always thinking, like, what are we solving here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| So do we have a current issue there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| I can't remember ever having seen a relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| anywhere near any of the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1232)|
| 0:20:43| I don't think that it's, I don't know if it's a big issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| or even if it's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| I'm just trying to make sure that it never becomes an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| I see. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| I just don't want it to become an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| that I'm appointed to an IDB board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| or whatever board it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| and then they have appointed my second cousin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| or first cousin to be on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| and we're voting on issues that affect Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| I don't really want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| So I guess I'm trying to, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| prevent something from ever happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| Does this get covered as well in, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| isn't there a Knox County nepotism policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| or is that just for hiring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| It's not for appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| There is both a state and local nepotism policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| with regard to hiring within,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| not on commission or its committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| but it has to do with the executive branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| and hiring within different departments there is nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| But it's about hiring somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| not necessarily appointing them to a volunteer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| It deals with the, you can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| somebody that's in charge of some part of some department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| can't go out and hire his wife to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| or her husband or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| So an example of this, Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| would be let's say Tammy Daley was on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| Then you would not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| it would not allow you to be the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| even as a non-voting member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| be the non-voting member of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| on that Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| or the Emergency Services Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| or the IDB or any of the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Transportation Committee of even Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| Well, Finance wouldn't have outside members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| but their, like, Audit Committee has outside members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| So you wouldn't, so, okay, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| It's just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| I don't want, I want to keep everything cleared above board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| Like you said, you know, Fire and Rescue Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| I'm friends with all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| but if I don't have, say, one of my in-laws got hired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1379)|
| 0:23:07| and they were working there and they were part of that board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| one of us would have to resign and that would probably be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| I would move off that board because I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| I would see that as a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Do you, Director Book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| do you feel like we need to further define what family is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| I know we just went through some other language ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| in another thing I'm working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| to really define in-laws, grandparents, brother-in-laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| you know, about enough of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| Well, it says family tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| and that included the way I understood it, cousins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| but family tree could be pretty extensive idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| East Tennessee family tree could be a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| You all need to figure that out yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| That's a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| Commissioner Daley, I would just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| I'll wrap up my comments by just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| I think it's a good thing to have more checks and balances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| to make sure nepotism and other conflicts of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| do not arise, so I'm supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| I think the language maybe needs a little bit more definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| with the law department to make sure before we pass it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| that I don't see any opposition to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| if you could sort of get the language right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| Then I would like for someone, or I will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| we can take the family tree out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| We can get with Jill, have Jill work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| Jill, that's your second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| You probably got a third one coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| So it's just, it's a preventive measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| that we do not have nepotism on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| And we got 30, when I was on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| 36 different committees and boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| that we're involved with, Knox County's involved with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| We appointed quite a few of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| We really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| Mr. Law Director, would you happen to have in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| how the nepotism policy reads for the executive branch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| I'm just looking for some consistency here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| if this is what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| And didn't we also define that, or it was suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| it's defined with our Merit Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| Wasn't that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Yeah, we just wrote some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| that's in the ordinance that we're going to discuss tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| and I can read it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| We actually worked on this with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| or I worked on this with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| and it says...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1538)|
| 0:26:01| And I'm just suggesting we might look for some consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| Here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| For purposes of this section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| family shall include spouse, parent, grandparent, siblings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| in-laws, or children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| So it didn't get into second cousins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| I would suggest then that we move family tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| and go with what Commissioner Jay said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| That's the definition, and that pretty much will cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| So it would just say any commissioner shall not serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| on any committee or board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| that has a family member as defined by...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| It shall include spouse, parent, grandparent, siblings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| in-laws, or children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| This is just crazy, but when do you stop becoming an in-law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| Say, for instance, you're divorced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| Are you still part of the family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| It's core known if you're black or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| I mean, really, what I'm saying right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| by legally what it is is if you're married into a family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| and then you fall out of favor, something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| and you're divorced and you apply for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| or you're working for something in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| does that restrict you because you're no longer in the family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| If you fall out of favor with that particular commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| odds are you're not going to make it on that committee anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| I think in any of these cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| what we always have is we have a backup of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| If there's a conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| and most of the time what they refer to as a conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| being a financial interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| So there's a pretty defined gray area in there already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| but there's always a check and balance of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| we have some real undue influence here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| Separate the waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| You mentioned the fire and rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| It's a great committee, and we're in the discussion now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| of how we're going to split $605,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| and if you've got a commissioner or representatives that are related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1690)|
| 0:28:19| that's two votes, and we don't need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| I'm just trying to look forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| Believe me, I love the fire and rescue committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| We've got some hard decisions to make, and that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| So I would make the motion to add the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| any commissioner shall not serve on any committee or board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| that has a family member as defined by spouse, parent, grandparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| siblings, in-laws, or children, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| That is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| I need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| I have a motion by Commissioner Jay, seconded by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| Did you get all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Madam Clerk, do you want me to make you read it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1740)|
| 0:29:08| Jill will correct us if there's anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| You and Jill will correct us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| I have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1754)|

| 0:29:24| It's the same as the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| We have, like tonight, an IDB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| We're going to have applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| And does any of us serve on an IDB board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| I don't think we do, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Is that part of the executive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| It's exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| I don't want family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| I would not like to see family members serving on the same board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| which could result in two votes unless they're outlaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Then they might vote against each other just to vote against each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| So, if we want to discuss, or we can go straight to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| I would be happy to make the same motion for item number seven as I did for item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| Same language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1806)|

| 0:30:31| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to let this committee know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| I'll also inform the full commission that I will, under sort of approval and direction from Chairman Buehler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1834)|
| 0:30:43| I'm going to be doing the orientation for new commissioners once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| The dates are set for the third week of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| I'll get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| I think it's the 22nd, 21st, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| And it's the Thursday, Friday of that week, about halfway between the election date and the swearing-in date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| And it will be the same as we did last time, a two-day process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| I'm going to start coordinating all the departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| We'll certainly spend a lot of time going over rules and processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| But I know two of our commissioners have been through that, and it's a deep dive for a couple days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| And I'll send all that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| It will include certainly a good review of all of our rules and how this committee works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1881)|
| 0:31:28| It's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| I said in on the last one, bringing in all the department heads and having them meet with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| It's fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| You say that will be the week of hopefully August the 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| I can give you the dates here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| It's going to be August the 18th and 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| That's a Thursday, Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| It's about two weeks after election day and two weeks before swearing-in day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| And it will be 18th and 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Probably a majority of it will be done upstairs in the conference room, commissioners' conference room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| That will work out great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| We need to let whoever, well, I'll let everyone know that I'm pretty sure August the 23rd and 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1915)|
| 0:32:05| and to let Drew know, is the new commissioners' training in Murfreesboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1925)|

| 0:32:12| No, they didn't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Didn't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| They didn't have it for Commissioner Lundy either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| Yeah, that's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| I'm pretty sure, mark your calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| I'm pretty sure it's the 23rd and 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| It's in Murfreesboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| It's about a day and a half, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| Yeah, a day and a half, and they go over ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| They'll go over a lot of things that you really need to know during that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| I don't think you all need to do it as, I think you're kind of grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| Terry does, and Daysha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| You have to do the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1964)|

| 0:32:50| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| I was thinking, and Daysha, we discussed this casually, that it was actually the 22nd and the 23rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1973)|
| 0:33:03| and we couldn't go because of a commission that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| It's usually not on a Monday, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| We'll find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Yeah, well, I'll find out for sure, and send it to Drew, and Drew can send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| I'll get with Charlie Curtis, but that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| Usually they don't do it on a Monday because they use that as a travel day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| It's a day and a half of scary to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| And it will get you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2009)|

| 0:33:46| You'll meet new commissioners that just got elected, so it's a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| I'll get the information to Drew and send it to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Can I ask something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2037)|

| 0:34:01| They used to have classes here at the University of Tennessee that were free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| and they had it right across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| At Miller's Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Miller's Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Miller's Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2051)|

| 0:34:16| And they go really deep in specific things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| I think they put a hold on that because of that great 2020 year of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| I know I get e-mails all the time about online training, but it's not for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| It's more for the registrar of deeds or the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| They've got to have certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| So, yeah, I went to quite a few of them over here at the Miller's Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| but I've not seen any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| I think it's COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| We can still find out what they may do, but it's one of the trustees that did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2092)|

| 0:35:12| Yeah, there's like an online course about Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2112)|

| 0:35:26| I would say Beer Board, Commissioner 1 and Commissioner 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| the training on eLearn, on the CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| And that gives you credit, too, for your seven hours on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| Any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| While we're talking about that, I did have one question, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| as far as I am guessing that the chair can approve expenses for these new people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2142)|
| 0:35:51| that are not yet formally sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| What we need to do is I believe that, Drew, did we reimburse the last time, four years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2155)|
| 0:36:03| Yes, but they don't get the full reimbursement that you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| There's a portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| I can't remember off the top of my head, but there is a portion they do not get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| But I do believe they do get some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| Can you say that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| They do get reimbursed for some of it, just not the full amount like you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| I can't remember off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Is it because they're not sworn in yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| Is it because they're not sworn in yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| We'll check into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| We'll check into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| They've got the registration and the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| That's the two main things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| Yeah, I think those two get reimbursed, but I don't think they get per diem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| and maybe mileage, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| I'll have to double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| Well, we'll check into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| But it's something that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| I would suggest that they go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| It is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2217)|

| 0:37:41| This is June, July, August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| It's been a pleasure serving as chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| and I think we did some great work this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220621-rules-committee?start=2266)|
