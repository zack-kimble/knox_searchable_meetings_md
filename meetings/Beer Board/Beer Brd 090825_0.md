| 0:08:40| a response about a conviction or a violation of liquor and beer laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=520)|

| 0:09:35| Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| Well, I think that if you look at the records that were supplied to us today, I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| can tell what happened there, that there was a sale of beer to underage, age 702.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| There was a diversion that has been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| It has been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| That's what it says on our record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| And that was the clarification that you needed to have supplied us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| I'm sorry, I was just going on what was in my packet, and that concerned me about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| that was going to be a legitimate manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| But you feel it's been handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=606)|

| 0:10:11| I will move approval then, pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=611)|
| 0:10:20| Yes, I have a quick question, since we're being light at this meeting a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=620)|
| 0:10:28| There's actually, and it's Francisco Hernandez, actually has an improper use of headlamp high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=628)|
| 0:10:36| beam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=636)|

| 0:10:54| I thought that was a courtesy, actually, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| That's a question on your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=655)|

| 0:12:04| I'm signing on a sales tax registration, certificate of zoning, approval from the fire inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| and task program certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=732)|

| 0:12:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| And I would like to comment that it's very exciting to see an old property that we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| It's kind of a landmark in West Knoxville reopened and had no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| Mr. Geiger, you might want to tell them about your relationship with the orangery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| It's not a new one, and I think that might be of interest to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| I actually ran that restaurant for Karen with Kathleen many, many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| I worked there for seven, almost eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| And Kathleen has been there for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| So we're bringing back the old staff, for lack of a better term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| It's kind of like full circle then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Wish you well there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| I have some concerns about the task certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| You have not been in for your task certification yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| We were under the impression that Kathleen had taken that, but apparently it expired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| the day before yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| So we will take it again next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| When are you shooting to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| September 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| That is after the next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| Well, we're doing our grand opening on September 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| We're trying to do a dry run the day after Labor Day, which is the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| Which is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| The day of our next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| And apparently a special called beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=821)|
| 0:13:54| There was a second to that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| What time is the dry run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| That Tuesday we're going to be open for a full lunch and dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| We plan on being open lunch and dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| In fact, we're doing a friends and family that Saturday night before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=852)|
| 0:14:21| How dry is it going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Well, we've already got our liquor license, so we thought we were ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| Are you all signed up for a task class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| I think basically what Vice Mayor Becker and others are talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| some folks on council sometimes are reluctant to issue beer permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| when task classes haven't been taken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| Well, we've both been through the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| It's just a question of the one-year requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| We've missed it by two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| Councilman Beiler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Well, they're not going to get the permit until they get the certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| So I try to be consistent and I'm comfortable with that, so I'll support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=907)|
| 0:15:15| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=915)|

| 0:19:02| I was reading your documentation on your managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| And all the managers either have Nashville or Pennsylvania addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| Part of the ownership is from Pennsylvania.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| And the managers are actually relocated to Knoxville now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1157)|

| 0:19:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| Are you sure that you have local managers not out of town since all the ownership is out of town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| Yep, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| They're moving from our Nashville location here to Knoxville to operate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| So are those managers who are moving from Nashville to Knoxville going to have the task program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| They've completed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1184)|

| 0:21:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| Mike Elliott, 234 Douglas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1313)|
| 0:22:00| I was asked to come and tell you about my progress on my beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| That was something I got in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| Really didn't have any address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| You had asked that I go talk to NBC about since I'm in the historic district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| They said that would be $1,000 for me to be heard by NBC, and I don't have the money to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| So that's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| Can you fill us in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| We've slept since the last time you were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| So why did you have to go to historic zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| Give a little more background on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| 501 Arthur is in the Mechanicsville Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| There was a lot of discussion when we were here last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| I thought I had been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| When I went to talk to Wanda about the license, she said, no, you need to see the head of NBC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1369)|
| 0:22:57| and see if it's something that we need to review for a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| And they said that I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| And I personally felt the fee was exorbitant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| And unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1388)|
| 0:23:16| Again, the history was you came before us and it was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| And it was denied, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| No, I believe you had said approval continued upon NBC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| There was a discussion or a question about it being in a historic district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| Well, it was more about residential, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| No, I thought it was historic because there actually was a beer permit there before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| With J&J's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| The zoning is C1 Neighborhood Commercial and H1 Historic Zoning Overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| And evidently, and I don't understand anything about zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| but evidently there was a use on review required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| I think where it comes from is J&J's was considered a market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| And really what we're looking at now is it probably does need to be rezoned as a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| which might be something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| I think that's probably the hinge point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| And I'm not sure if you have any control over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| I believe it's the on-premise service of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1455)|
| 0:24:22| Counselor McFarland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Zoning overlays for historic or NC1, that doesn't affect the use of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| Or the permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| I mean, there are plenty of places with H1 overlays that serve alcohol, that serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1472)|
| 0:24:42| I think it's a zoning type and not an overlay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1482)|
| 0:24:49| Well, it's not clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| But someone can educate me at their disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| Counselor McFarland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Oh, I don't know what I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| But I was very disappointed when we did not approve this at its previous hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1499)|
| 0:25:08| simply because this gentleman went into this believing that because there had been a beer permit previously in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1508)|
| 0:25:17| And as I recall, a lot of the discussion involved the residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| And I fully remember Councilman Booker's comments, which I thought spoke to his sense of how that was not a change for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1522)|
| 0:25:33| And, in fact, he felt that it might be a better thing for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| And perhaps you wouldn't mind repeating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| Well, no, I don't mind repeating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| I, too, was disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| In fact, I asked if you had your license, and you told me no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| I don't see why you don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| And I really appreciated the very fine article I read about your place this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| And I'm dying to get there to eat lunch and hopefully drink a beer on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| Well, just to clarify, sir, I think, to the best of my recollection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| that it was approved based on pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1569)|
| 0:26:17| So I guess the question before us is, and the gentleman will be able to partly answer that, will an extension, do you think, help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1577)|
| 0:26:29| I think the, from what I can tell, the only thing that would help would maybe be a recommendation to go with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| Because, and honestly, when I went to MPC, you had asked me to speak to Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| And that was not the easiest thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| And I don't have a lot of time to jump through hoops, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| And I kept on being helped out by a lot of very helpful people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| But I never did get to speak to him personally about the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| And I think the issue being, would they be willing to waive the $1,000 fee to be heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| And I would think that would be the only thing that would help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| Because right now it's really just a financial matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| If you put the screws to me and if I had the money, I would just be paying it out and doing whatever I had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1627)|
| 0:27:15| Council Member Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| Mr. Swanson, zoning question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| I don't have my code up, but I'm assuming you do because you have your computer out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| A C-1 zone, does it allow eating and drinking establishments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| So this actually isn't a zoning change issue then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| I'm not sure why the zoning people say he has to have a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| I'm not altogether clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| But the Metropolitan Planning Commission people have a great deal of expertise in the zoning area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1662)|
| 0:27:50| But it is true that a C-1 zoning does authorize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| And H-1 doesn't impact the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Mr. Forrest is correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| H-1 is a look issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| I can't give you a satisfactory answer to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| I don't know why the Metropolitan Planning Commission is telling him he has to have a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| I do not know the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| He may have to, and I just don't know the answer to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| This could be an interesting one to take up in half an hour when Mark Donaldson is in this room and see if that helps us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1702)|
| 0:28:30| Councilman Romney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| So for the purposes of our meeting tonight, do we need to extend this for another 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| And if so, I'd like to make that motion so that we could get some further answers as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| or not the $1,000 fee needs to be paid to make application to be heard at the Historic Zoning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| or whether or not, Mr. Donaldson, that's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| But then we might have better answers than going around in circles tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| So I'd like to move to extend this permit, I guess, not postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| Extend this permit for another 30 days until the next scheduled billboard meeting in an attempt to get some answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| 28 days, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Councilman Bluehill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| No, I'd just like to say let me help you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| Let's talk about this right after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| I'll accept what Councilman Woodhuller said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| I will ditto that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| I would do anything to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| I think it's the most unfortunate thing, and I don't believe MPC has put this gentleman in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| I believe this Spear Board has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| What was your timing on opening and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Do you have a liquor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| No, I've been open, and this is just the first step moving in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| Ultimately, that's what I'd like, but I was advised to take the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| When I started doing dinners, I started moving toward getting a beer license, and I'm already open for dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| I've been open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| So you'd like to have this done as soon as possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Mr. Swanson, what are our options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| Extend the beer permit or extend the time within which you can get the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| or not extend the time within which to get the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| Those are your only options right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| Okay, so we pass this subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| It's already passed subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| You just need to extend the period of time within which he completes that final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| And the motion is to extend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| I could have just passed it, period, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| I could have just passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| You passed it last time, subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| But I'm just wondering, you know, are there any other options available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Not now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Is that that difficult?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| A question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Is what that difficult a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| The question I asked you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| What do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| I'm just wondering if that question I asked was that difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| We're voting on giving an extension, 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Give him a beer, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| CBS Pharmacy, number 7698.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1876)|
| 0:31:33| Well, I don't know if it's appropriate to make a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| when the applicant is not here, but I would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| there's a problem with the application, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| I talked with, I believe, who did I talk with this day, this afternoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| I can't remember now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| I talked to a number of people today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| And there is a problem with some of the information on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| And I know it's just a real little thing, but they have not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| the manager is not from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| The owners are in Pennsylvania.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| And I just do not believe they have familiarized themselves whatsoever with the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| And it bothers me when I see these applications come before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| and the information is requested and it should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| the best information should be here available to us about the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| and the funeral home and so on, or we should have it removed from the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| This is totally bad information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| And I just think it needs to be straightened out before they come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| because I don't like to look at applications that have incorrect information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| I know that seems a little picky, but when the manager doesn't live even in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| I just can't be convinced that proper consideration has been given to Knoxville's regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1973)|
| 0:33:01| And I talked with Ms. Day about this, and it's a frustration for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| People come to them and ask them to solve all these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| Well, that is not their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| But I think it's the responsibility of the applicants to familiarize themselves with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| that they're going to do business in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| So somehow I wonder if there is any way this billboard tonight can inform them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| that they must correct the information here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| Because tonight I was prepared to ask for a postponement until it was corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| Now, I don't know if this is a Mr. Swanson question or a Mr. Hall question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| I really think it's probably not a question for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| but I would think the answer to the question would be we would just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| Wanda would just contact this applicant and suggest to them that it was said in this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| that some of the responses on this application do not appear to be correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| and they need to go back and check their information very carefully before they come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| Otherwise, they run the risk of when they come back here, it's going to be postponed yet again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| and that will delay their beer permit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| That would satisfy me, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| I just felt it unfair tonight to postpone it for two weeks and have them come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| and knowing that I was already going to ask for a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| So it seemed more fair to them to inform them that they need to get their application in order before they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2072)|
| 0:34:40| excuse me, it would be four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Are you making a motion to postpone it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| I make that motion to postpone it for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| Although they had already asked, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| No, they hadn't asked for a postponement, had they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| No, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Then I move that it be postponed four weeks and the corrections to the application be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| prior to them coming back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2109)|

| 0:35:25| Did you hear anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Councilman Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| I'll lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| I move to move this September beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2135)|

| 0:35:39| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| Is there any other business that needs to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| They have a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090825?start=2147)|
