| 0:00:28| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=28)|
| 0:00:29| Commissioner Smith has just joined us, so we'll mark him as present as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=29)|
| 0:00:32| And Commissioner Smith is here, so we'll mark him as present as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=32)|
| 0:00:40| We have 10 of 11 commissioners present, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| Clerk, if you'd read the first item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=42)|
| 0:00:47| First item is Ordinance O-11-10-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=47)|
| 0:00:50| It's amending Knox County Code Section 2-31, Entitled Districts, to establish the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=50)|
| 0:00:54| commission districts for the county of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| This amends Ordinance O-91-11-104, adopted December 16, 1991, Ordinance O-01-7-103, adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=57)|
| 0:01:07| August 27, 2001, and O-09-8-103, adopted September 28, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=67)|
| 0:01:14| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=74)|
| 0:01:16| This is Plan 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=76)|
| 0:01:18| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| Motion's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=80)|
| 0:01:23| Ms. Buttry, did you want to speak now or did you want to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=83)|
| 0:01:26| Okay, Cindy Buttry has asked to speak, and so we'd like to recognize her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| So if you'd give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Cindy Buttry, 6404 Ridgewalk Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=95)|
| 0:01:41| I am here, not as a board member, but as a citizen, to speak to you on behalf of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=101)|
| 0:01:51| of the plan that you guys are getting ready to vote on for yourselves and potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| The only thing that I would caution you about doing when you look at this plan for 1A is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=120)|
| 0:02:09| that you are, and this was addressed during the redistricting committee, you are splitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| I just ask you, and I know that time is of the essence, however, and last month I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=138)|
| 0:02:27| have said to hurry, but this time I'm asking you to take the time to get it right and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| take into consideration this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| If both, if this plan passes for commission and for the school board, that community will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=156)|
| 0:02:43| be represented by three different commissioners and three different school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| That's just not, that's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| That doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| I just ask you to try to look at that, to see what you can come up with, and to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=176)|
| 0:03:04| that into consideration before you make your vote for this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| A couple of things that I want to say is that, one, while there are some things about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=194)|
| 0:03:24| plan that I like, one of the things that I want to speak to is the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| And this commission seems to have a big problem with process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| When I look at the way we have responded to the school board recently, the way we responded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=215)|
| 0:03:46| to when we asked the tenure plan to go out and find us a, this commission asked the tenure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=226)|
| 0:03:53| plan to go out and find a place for permanent supportive housing outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| We threw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| We fought the school board on the Carter school issue, the Hillside and Ridgetop committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=241)|
| 0:04:09| that we put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| We sent them out to do their work for three years, and they came back, and we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| close to throwing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| And now we put this joint committee together and asked them to go do their work, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| come back with their recommendations for us after delving into the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| And we throw that out, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| So I'm very disappointed in us and the lack of respect that we seem to show to these commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=270)|
| 0:04:41| and committees and task forces and whatever we ask, go and ask someone to do, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=281)|
| 0:04:50| if it includes regular citizens who aren't compensated for their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=290)|
| 0:04:59| Oh, another one was the board that evaluated all of the nonprofits for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=299)|
| 0:05:07| That was another one that we decided to throw out some of their work and do it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=307)|
| 0:05:17| So I think that we either need to respect the process that we, as a body, put in motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=317)|
| 0:05:25| or we need to just stop doing it and just admit that we're going to do it all ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| and just stop wasting everybody's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| There were ample opportunities for people to come, public and private, to come and weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=335)|
| 0:05:45| on any of these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| And, unfortunately, we did not have the public input and the turnout that we did a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| and I don't know if that's because there were so many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| My suspicion is that's because there were so many other things happening at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| It's hard to prioritize, and when you've got a lot of other things, speaking as a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| and you've got a lot of other things going on, you can only make time to be involved in so many issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=368)|
| 0:06:15| But I'm disappointed that the public didn't make more of an effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| I'm disappointed that some of us didn't make more of an effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| And I'm really disappointed in us as a group for how disrespectful we have been over the past year or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=386)|
| 0:06:36| to all of these different groups that we have asked to go out and do something for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| And I've only been on one of these committees, and that was this redistricting committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=401)|
| 0:06:49| We met a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| We discussed a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| We delved into the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| Larry and Lynn did an excellent job co-chairing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| It was a great process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| It was a wonderful process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| It was exactly, in my opinion, the way that government is supposed to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| especially with these two different bodies coming together and cooperating on a shared goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=425)|
| 0:07:13| And we're just going to throw it out because we don't like it, or some of us don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=433)|
| 0:07:23| So, like I said, the only thing really, I like certain parts of this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| but the biggest problem that I have is the way that we are doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=450)|
| 0:07:37| Either respect, we need to either respect the work that we ask these groups to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| or we need to just stop asking them to do it and just do it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| So I think we have done some really unpleasant things over the past year with these groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| And I'm disappointed in us as a legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=473)|
| 0:08:01| No other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| Commissioner Burroughs and Anders have voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| So the vote is 9-2 in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| The next item is Ordinance O-11-10-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| It's amending Chapter 2 of the Knox County Code, entitled Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| by adding a new Article 13 to establish the Board of Education Districts for the County of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| This amends Ordinance O-01-11-101SS, adopted November 19, 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=515)|
| 0:08:42| and Ordinance O-01-12-104, adopted January 28, 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| Motion to approve 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| Motion has been made in second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| I thought I would respond to Ms. Buttrey's comments about Norwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| I certainly, Cindy, I certainly agree with you on a number of points there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| And it is difficult to have a small community, relatively small community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| represented by, you know, different groups legislatively and from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=562)|
| 0:09:30| And being a person who lives, you know, played ball at Inskip, Norwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=570)|
| 0:09:37| had friends, of course, from West High School that lived in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| So I'm very familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| I know a lot of people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| And it was all in my district to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| And so I don't want it to go away from my district, but it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| And so, I mean, I understand you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| It just seems to me, and also in response to a couple of things that Amy had to say just then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| I mean, there's no perfect plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| Every one of these plans has shortcomings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| Brad's having to give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| You know, he's getting whacked in this plan somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| But that's the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| And I would disagree on one point that Amy had, and that is that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| all of these are receiving a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| but it's one plan that receives the highest recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| So they're all being formulated and they've all been considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| And in a way, I feel, you know, I do feel bad for the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| I hope they don't consider me a traitor for voting for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| But I just, you know, just all things considered, it just seems to be the best that we can do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=652)|
| 0:11:00| And it's a tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| But we're all represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| We're all part of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| I'd like to say I represent the people in Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| I represent the people in West Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| I represent Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| And so I don't quite cut it up like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| And certainly the Norwood community can call me any time, and I'll do whatever I can to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| They know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| So I think that's somewhat the view of the way we all feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| We represent this county, and we're going to do the best we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| regardless of which county is having an issue, which part of the county is having an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| Yeah, I do want to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Actually, if I'm correct in this, and no offense to Tony, but we didn't, the committee did not recommend all of these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=704)|
| 0:11:53| We considered all of these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| We recommended Plan 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| So it's, I want to make sure that that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| We evaluated all of these plans, but only one plan was recommended by the committee, and that was Plan 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=722)|
| 0:12:12| Cindy Buttry, did you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| You had asked to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| I assume you want to speak on both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Do I need to state my name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Cindy Buttry, 6404 Ridgewalk Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| In regards to the school plan, I think Ms. Broyles said it best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=746)|
| 0:12:37| I'm really, you know, I've already said that I was not going to run again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=757)|
| 0:12:44| So this really is not about me, per se, or anything having to do with me running again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=764)|
| 0:12:55| But I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| I think this process was given every due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| A number of commissioners, and I won't name names, even said from the outset that they would vote the way that the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=782)|
| 0:13:14| the plan that the school board voted for, that you didn't want to usurp our authority, and yet you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=794)|
| 0:13:23| And as a board member, you know, I'd like to think that we can all get along, and I appreciate and welcome the idea of a retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=803)|
| 0:13:35| But when stuff like this happens, it makes it very, very difficult as a board member, after Carter and now this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=815)|
| 0:13:45| to believe anything that this body says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| It's frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| It's disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| And as a citizen and a taxpayer and a mom and an elected official, I'm very disappointed, very disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=833)|
| 0:14:06| I feel like I give this body all the respect that it deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| I understand that you're the funding authority for us, and I understand that you all have tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| And believe me, if anybody gets it, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| But this process stinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| It just stinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| I know that this is a done deal and that the decision's made and that more than likely 1A is going to be the plan that the board voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=872)|
| 0:14:42| But what I think is really disheartening is that I heard no discussion about the fact that the board voted for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=882)|
| 0:14:51| and that we met all our criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| We adopted, by the way, and passed criteria for our own redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=894)|
| 0:15:01| And we asked time and time again, did you want to try to align?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=901)|
| 0:15:09| Was that what this was about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Or were you going to respect the decision that we made even if it meant that we didn't align but we met our criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=911)|
| 0:15:20| And I don't know of anybody up here that necessarily said that flat out we're going to do what you don't want us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=920)|
| 0:15:34| The whole intent and the whole goal and the whole purpose was that you would let us make our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=934)|
| 0:15:41| I feel lied to and I feel betrayed by some of you folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| And I don't take this lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| Like I said, this is not about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| This is about being an elected official, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| And you saying to us one thing and then turning around and voting and doing something completely different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| without even the common decency and courtesy to give a phone call and say, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| I've changed my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| I can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| You know, my opinion or how we feel about this has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=974)|
| 0:16:22| I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| I know that you all have a difficult decision and that this is not easy for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| But it certainly isn't easy for the nine of us sitting across the street either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| and for some of us who do want to try to get along and work together toward a common goal with this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=996)|
| 0:16:45| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| Cindy, can I ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| You know, you made the comment about Norwood, but you didn't tell us which plan you wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| I assume that you're endorsing Plan 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| I would be fine with 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| I would be fine with 3A or 4A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| But 1A, honestly, Dr. Briggs, 1A did not even garner a vote on our redistricting committee when we met jointly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1021)|
| 0:17:13| It dropped off the first round because it did not even get a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| And then this happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| You know, I was there at the meeting when the committee, you know, voted on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| and I remember 2A was the one that carried it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| It was really just to be fair for everyone here who may not be aware of it, it was a split vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| It was really where the school board all voted one way, the commission members voted another way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| and then sort of the swing votes were those that were represented by the MPC and Farragut, the Farragut representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| I mean, it wasn't like a unanimous decision that came from the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| But one other thing that maybe I was confused about when you were here last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| and I appreciated you coming down and talking to us, is that I think I asked you specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| was it more important for the school board to maintain separate districts from the commission districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1080)|
| 0:18:09| or was the school board in favor of everything lining up together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| And I believe that you said at that time that other than the members of the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| who would be redistricted out of their present districts is that the school board, the consensus of the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| and you were speaking for yourself, but your belief was that the school board wanted the commission districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| and the school board districts to align.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| And I'll have to say that changed because I had said before I will vote for the school board to get what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1115)|
| 0:18:43| But what I understood from what you just said was what the school board wanted was the commission districts to align| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| with the school board districts, other than the school board members who were being districted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| They would oppose it, but otherwise the school board wanted them to align.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| I think that was what the whole process was supposed to be about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| was trying to see if we could come to a consensus and see if we could align.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1144)|
| 0:19:10| At the end of the day, it didn't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| My belief is based on conversations I had, even I would say, yes, I think that we should try to work toward aligning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1155)|
| 0:19:26| And I'm okay with being redistricted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| But at the end of the day, the board didn't take a vote on whether we should align.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| We took a vote on a specific plan and presented that plan to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| And it wasn't necessarily, and I believe I said this that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| that it wasn't necessarily an intent to align or to force you guys to go with Plan 3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| That was what we decided that was best in the best interest of the school board at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| So if I misled you or misled this body, I apologize because that wasn't the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1198)|
| 0:20:06| But, you know, I think when the board voted for 3A, it was kind of clear as well, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1206)|
| 0:20:14| knowing that there might be a commissioner that would be redistricted out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| that that probably wouldn't be the plan that this body would adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1219)|
| 0:20:26| We just went with the best plan that fit our criteria that we adopted, that we did vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1226)|
| 0:20:34| And the alignment was not part of that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| But, you know, I just want to say, just so you and other school board members and the public knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| is that I would have voted for the school board to get the alignment that they felt best served the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1242)|
| 0:20:49| and the public through that alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| But, you know, after what I heard, I voted to align last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| Unfortunately, with the deadlines we have, I think it's going to be tough for us to do anything different now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| But, you know, I appreciate what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| And I do want to make one other comment in reference to the part about whether the committee's work was worthless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1265)|
| 0:21:14| I mean, I think there was a lot of work that the committee did, and they really sent four plans to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| And it took a lot of work to get to those four plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| And we didn't make any modification of the four plans that they sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| And the first proposal that came up was for 2A, and it was voted down for various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| But we've had very little input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| I didn't get one e-mail or one call or one anything from the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| I have not had one communication with anybody from the school board, even when I really would have liked to have had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| Not one school board member contacted me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| And, you know, so I sometimes wonder just what the, you know, what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| how much interest there really is in this, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| I mean, it's not, you know, how controversial it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| And I would have liked to have gotten more input about it myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| because I would have supported the school board, I'll tell you, on what they were trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| even if it meant the districts didn't line up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| I think this thing's flashing here, so I can't talk anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| The next phase of this will be to mute the microphones, I'm guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| I better hurry up and start talking because time's running on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| You know, I guess I just, and I've been pretty what I feel is consistent in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| And, Tim, do we have, in terms of the initial criterion that we set in committee, do these plans meet that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1354)|
| 0:22:46| I know they're probably varying degrees, but do these four plans meet that established criterion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1366)|
| 0:22:55| I know I don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| I'll try to find the four criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| I know all four, high school and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| All four plans, yeah, all four plans met the criteria from the standpoint that they all put a high school in at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| or every district has at least one high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| But, you know, some of the other criteria are a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| Yeah, more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| They're a little more qualitative, not as quantitative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| So minimizing change, you know, minimize the impact of change to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| You know, we generally view that as move the fewest people as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| But keep communities together, that type of evaluation is not something that we can really provide much guidance on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| I think that's kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| You know, and hopefully I've been pretty consistent and clear on my wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| And I wanted 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| I think I'm the one that proposed 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| I think 2A is the best plan for both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| However, I do feel and I think I've said that I think we need to do something here that may be uncomfortable for some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1433)|
| 0:24:03| And I'll freely admit all four had the same plan for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| So, you know, it didn't affect Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| These are still difficult votes because I, like Commissioner Norman, strongly feel that I am Knox County's commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| that I represent this entire county and my votes, every, you know, vote that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| every vote that I have has the entire county, the whole county in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| Although it may not always appear that that's the case, but it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| I think we need to do something today that will be lasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| I think us having separate districts, I think every community that has districts that align have pockets where there are some differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1481)|
| 0:24:54| I think currently, our current districts, there are communities that have one school board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1494)|
| 0:25:02| three school board members, and three county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| That happens today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| That's where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| So, you know, we're going to always have that with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| You're not going to be able to, and we've got some bright minds working on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| you're not going to ever be able to make that because what is a community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| It kind of morphs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| I mean, if you look at the Carnes community, it's morphed, it's grown in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| as well as a lot of these other communities because we're a dynamic community, a dynamic region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| So it's my wish to align us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| And was this the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Was this my first plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| No, it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| But I'm saying this will do something for the county that I think will be lasting and will be a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| will engage folks over time and assist the consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| Even though you may have somebody across the street that's a different school board, we've got to draw a street somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| You're going to have a street that's going to work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| But I do think in time they'll get to know the commissioners better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| they'll get to know their school board members better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| I think the school board members and the commissioners can work together a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| So I look forward to the retreat to talk about these issues and other things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| And it's really, you know, I'll say that I'm all for processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| I'm all for sticking to processes, but neither body has been very good at sticking to processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| You know, votes are all over the place in terms of we're going to do it this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| and then we're not going to do it this way because I don't want to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| So that's just the nature in which we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| So, you know, I do hope that we start this dialogue, that we start this communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| but that we do it with a sense of we've both been bad actors at certain times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| And I don't really view this as a bad action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| Like I said, it's not preferable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| But I do think at the end of the day it's going to be for the greater good of the entire Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| What I look at, you know, maybe we ought to just run, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| like you and Mr. Shouse, everybody run it large, and we all represent Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| I think, you know, Sam, what you said, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| We represent all of Knox County, not just our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| But I look at it and I just want to remind us that it's not about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| It's not about school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| We've got the endorsement from the Women's League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| We've got the endorsement from the new Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| We've got the endorsement from the election commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| But more importantly and overwhelmingly from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| Every meeting, Dr. Briggs and I, we were at the high school community day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| They had 99 people at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| I polled them last month and asked them last month, do you all want to line up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| Every meeting I go to when I ask that question, every single person has told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| I've only had one person that says, no, they don't want to line up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| But I've asked hundreds of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| So, you know, folks, it's about the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| It's about what the community wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| And it's like what Sam says, it's a time right now we can get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| We can get it right and for the next ten years we can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| I just want to remind you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Yeah, a couple of things that I want to clear up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| My understanding was that when this committee brought these recommendations forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| Plan 2 was the first plan or was the preferable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| And the plan that got the second highest number of votes was actually Plan 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| And I want to reiterate, Dr. Briggs, that we didn't bring four plans to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| We recommended a plan to commission, not four plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| The committee recommended a plan, Plan 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| I also think that the school board was a little more comfortable with alignment under Plan 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1738)|
| 0:29:08| than under the plan that we're about to adopt for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| Now, each of the plans, each four of the plans, we would not have considered them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| In fact, there were multiple plans that we originally looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| These four were the ones who met the criteria and they met them to varying degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| Now, as far as an endorsement from the League of Women Voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| I'm comfortable saying that the League endorsed the concept of alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1769)|
| 0:29:36| But the League also endorses the concept of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| So the League did not endorse us coming up here and throwing out the work of the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| to do what we wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| They endorsed the concept of alignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| and they've always historically endorsed the concept of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| So I want to be clear about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| Any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Commissioners Broyles, Owen B., and Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| So, Broyles, Owen B., and Anders voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| Was that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| The vote is 8-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| Yes, we're going to take a short break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Before we do, commissioners, I'm not feeling well and my voice is about gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| And so I don't want anyone to think that I'm not interested in our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| So Commissioner Anders is going to work with Mr. Bailey to chair this next session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| Also, you have received a letter from Judge Stansberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| Unfortunately, Ms. Jeter passed away, and we are required to name a judicial commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| You have additional information here for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| So we're going to stand and recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| We'll come back around 5-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111110?start=1864)|
