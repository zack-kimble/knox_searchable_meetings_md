| 0:00:49| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=49)|
| 0:00:50| Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=50)|
| 0:00:51| We have 16 commissioners that are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=51)|
| 0:00:52| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=52)|
| 0:00:53| Yes, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=54)|
| 0:00:56| We're going to get to you in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| I'm sure you want to address what I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| Owings, our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=62)|
| 0:01:03| Oh, here he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=63)|
| 0:01:04| He's eating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| As you know, Chancellor Fantzler has ruled that in his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=65)|
| 0:01:08| ruling with regards to Midway that he did not feel the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| county commission could change a sector plan that was only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=71)|
| 0:01:14| MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| Would you weigh in on that and let us know what our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=75)|
| 0:01:18| responsibilities are moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=78)|
| 0:01:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| First of all, we still don't have a written ruling from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| We received an oral opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=85)|
| 0:01:31| We do have a court report where it's being transcribed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| But what is really going to give us more information, better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=96)|
| 0:01:42| information, is what the judge puts in writing and what he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| As of right now, Buzz, you can weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| If you hear something contrary to your understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| As of right now, what the court looked at was the Midway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| It found that there was not a substantial, wasn't substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| evidence in the record to support changing the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=126)|
| 0:02:17| MPC as well as Knox County begged to differ with that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| defense of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| But nevertheless, that's what the court so found in its oral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| It may be, I mean, right now we don't know what the written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| ruling is going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Once we have that, we'll better be able to see if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| something that needs to be revisited or if it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| that's worthy of appeal or what our options are, which includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=164)|
| 0:02:50| MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| But right now, MPC is to review sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| You know, we've been doing this for how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| Twenty-five years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| And then all of a sudden the judge, I think, changes things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| But it's still not in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| It still hasn't been committed to writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| So I'm anxious to see what the court ultimately says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| And then we'll know more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| We'll know what our options are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| As of right now, I think we look at MPC's recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| whether they've approved of a change in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| And I don't know why MPC can't ask us to approve of a sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| I think we proceed as we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| We ought to ask questions whether there's been, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| there's substantial evidence in the record to warrant a change in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| and take it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| Sort of continuing along that line, I'm John King, PO Box 2425 in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| I'm requesting a postponement of two matters on your agenda under zoning appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| 6A06SP for the sector plan and the immediately following rezoning appeals by WC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=254)|
| 0:04:24| Development, and I represent the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| What is involved there obviously includes an appeal of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| and there is an issue now presented by the Chancellor's opinion as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| or not that appeal to this body is appropriate until all of us get that opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=281)|
| 0:04:48| and try to figure out what it says, does, and how it affects us procedurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| I think I'm simply asking that it be postponed for an additional 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| We ought to have it by the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| I can figure out what it is I'm supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| We can defer it to July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| I wanted to ask if there was any opposition here and if they had a problem with deferring it before we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=309)|
| 0:05:17| We've been deferring it for about six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| I just wanted to make sure this was the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| My agreement with the potential opposition was that I would not come down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| and ask you all to consider this matter without advising them that I was going to do so first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| I mean, these are my citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| I didn't want to get in trouble for something without giving them the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Do we need a motion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| I was just going to ask the law director, going back to Chancellor Fensler's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=346)|
| 0:05:53| changing the sector plans, what we've changed in recent months and years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| does that have any effect on that if those folks or a group comes and files suit on those cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| I think this one is specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| It's case specific to the Midway Road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| It would depend on whether we've had under the court's ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| if we've met the test of having a substantial change in circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| on other sector plan amendments that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| So the answer is it's case specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| and I'm not sure I know of another case right now that we have that's pending other than Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=392)|
| 0:06:43| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| Mr. Law Director, it was my understanding that Chancellor Fensler ruled that we don't have the authority to change sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=406)|
| 0:07:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Which would be with just about everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| I mean, if someone's come down here asking for a change of sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| I mean, how would that be different than the Midway Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| I want to see the Chancellor commit that to writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| and then we can go over your options on whether we wish to appeal that ruling or what our options really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=434)|
| 0:07:23| I don't agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| Well, I agree with what you say, other than I don't know, and I don't think we have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| Do we have any sector plan changes tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| I didn't see any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| But let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| You know, what is to prevent MPC from bringing it to us for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| I don't see anything in the law that prevents that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| So if the Chancellor is saying that no, never, may this body review a sector plan amendment, I think he's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| And I just don't know that that's what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| And before we pass judgment on that or before we talk about our options, I'd like to see what he says in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| Well, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| We need to have whatever he's going to say in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| When do we expect that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Does he have a certain amount of time that he's supposed to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Or it's at his own discretion when he's going to commit to this in writing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| I don't know that we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| He's had it now 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| What was it, 30 days ago roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| Approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Just by way of information, I happened to be talking to one of the lawyers involved in that case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| and asked if they had received a transcript from the court reporter who was there who took down the memorandum opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| And I was advised that they did not yet have it, that a transcript had been requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| that it would be prepared sometime, but they did not yet have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=527)|
| 0:08:55| Commissioners can do what they want, and I know it doesn't affect tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| but I'm not going to vote for anything with a sector plan change until we have some type of finality to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=538)|
| 0:09:07| Well, at least have an order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| At least an order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| I mean, if that's what he comes out and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| I think we're going to have to listen to what the judge says until it's appealed or we just continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=552)|
| 0:09:20| But, Mr. Law, I mean, Mr. Chairman, I know we started zonings, but we had postponed the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=560)|
| 0:09:29| and I didn't know if it would be, and he's been out there for hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| If we could go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| We're going back to 901 to 914 right after zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| I just want to make sure we get to it as soon as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| Clerk, could you read the first zoning request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| We're on page 29, request 5-B-08-SNC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| It's a request of Jackie Wayne Newman for street name change from unnamed joint permanent easement to Anna Lester Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| street located between Clement Road and the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Go to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| This request is 4-H-08-RZ, request of TA8MLLC for rezoning from RA low-density residential to PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=614)|
| 0:10:23| located on the southeast side of Westland Drive, southwest end of Crestmore Circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| southwest of Dartford Road and the 4th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| Yes, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| Here on behalf of the applicant, Tom Justice, and the planner and landscape architect, Trey Benefield, is here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=642)|
| 0:10:51| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| One quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Looking at the map you provided, it looks like you're eliminating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| or getting rid of a tennis court that's existing there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| I just want Commissioner Norman to know that because he reacts very badly when tennis courts are eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=666)|
| 0:11:13| I'm officially too old to play now, so it's all right with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| He can remove it if he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| Let Arthur go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| If I may, at this time I'm going to ask Mr. Justice to pass out some photographs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| This is four and a half to five acres of property located on Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| It has on it a house built in the 30s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| It's a Barber and McMurray house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| It has also some old trees, one cortese found to be a chestnut tree which is over 100 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| which means it's survived the blight, and several other large trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| The property is presently zoned RA under the county zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| and RA would permit houses on 10,000-acre, even 10,000-square-feet lots in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=723)|
| 0:12:14| The request is for planned residential at one to five units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| and I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Benefield if I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| and let him explain why this zoning is necessary for this piece of property because of the house and the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| It's necessary because of the house and the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| When I first walked the property, I was very impressed by the historic house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| It's a Barber house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| and many of you may be aware that Charles Barber was one of the famous architects back in the 20s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| and 30s that was active in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| This house has been preserved all this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| Secondly, there's a grove of trees that's really spectacular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| There's oaks and maples as well as the chestnut that Arthur referenced before, which is very rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=778)|
| 0:13:05| I don't know how familiar you are, but the chestnut, there was a blight that came through back in the 30s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| and took all the chestnuts out of our eastern woodlands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| and this is one that survived possibly because it was on a farm as opposed to in the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| Piece of trivia on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| It could be the few trees that survived could have the genes that helped develop new chestnuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| that are able to survive future blights, so that's a factor that we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=806)|
| 0:13:33| At any rate, when I saw the existing opportunities on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| I hated the idea to use a very typical subdivision layout of a cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| and uniformly spaced houses across the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| because that would mean that we would inevitably need to remove the house and remove most of the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| I was relieved when I met with Mr. Jostice that he had the same opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| that the house and the trees need to be a central element to the design of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| They need to contribute to the quality of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| and they need to continue contributing to the quality of the overall community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| outside of the area that we're looking at developing ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| So we came up with a plan that includes some smaller lots around the perimeter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| single-family lots that abut the other single-family residential in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| as well as a small number of townhouses that front on the existing grove of maples and oaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| and the open green space that will be preserved as this project is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| We feel like this is the right way to develop the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| because it does preserve the assets of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| and it also provides a more dense housing than we see in some other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=882)|
| 0:14:53| so that, you know, where it's closer to infrastructure of the downtown community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| and the other close in rather than that that's further out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| So a little bit about the type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| Of course, the single-family housing will be controlled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| and it will be designed to match or themed after the historic house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| The townhouses are what we understand people are more concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| As you can see, they'll have a style that is reminiscent of an older style,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| and the brick color, the shingles and so forth, and the scale of the windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| and all will also match the historic home that's on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| Sir, I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| I'm Trey Benefield, 516 Union Avenue in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| Commissioner Luthal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| I guess, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| We don't have a motion on the floor yet, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| I will move to approve if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| Well, I heard that there might be some opposition to this, so it's not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| I may speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| There was opposition initially, and I think it was based mainly on the townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| That opposition had diminished by the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Mr. Justice and Mr. Benefield had met with several neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| Those on the north side of Westland Drive positively withdrew their opposition at the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| There were several people here who spoke in opposition at the MPC meeting to the townhouses, or one person did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=983)|
| 0:16:32| I don't know whether that opposition still exists or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| We tried to explain the plan, the reason for requesting plan residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:43| which gives the landowner and the planners more flexibility than simply the RA zoning on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:51| Well, now that we have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| You talked about the tree and the importance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| and what assurances do we have to make sure that you protect that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| Have you hired anybody to make sure that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| We did consult with Cortese Tree Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| Tom Schmidt came out and looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| The plan that we're looking at now obviously preserves the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| It's our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| We see that tree as an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| We're going to do everything we can to preserve it and as many of the others as possible and historic home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| And I would add one other thing, if I may, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| Under the plan residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| you have to come back with a concept plan and use on review to the Metropolitan Planning Commission showing what you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:43| You cannot do under RA zone, all you do is subdivide the property and go ahead and build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| Under the plan residential zone, you have to come back, submit plans to the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1069)|
| 0:17:56| and go through a public hearing at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| They can place any number of restrictions such as what we've been talking about on trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| Can you, I guess, the maker of the motion, would you make part of it that they have to make assurances that those trees are protected as part of being approved for their planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:18| Be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| And also according to MPC recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| According to MPC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| And does the second agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| I guess Commissioner Lambert seconded that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| Elaine and I both are the commissioners in the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| Trey, obviously I recognize your work, so I know you drew your own plans because you've drawn some for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| I guess there's two things I'm really disappointed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| First of all, Arthur, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you and the work you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| I think you're very thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Gentlemen, this is the first time I've looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| And as Mr. Schmelzer said in the MPC that's recorded in the minutes, there was 50 families that were opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1135)|
| 0:19:05| Would you like to read the minutes, Trey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| It's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| I've got an issue with the fact that I see this for the first time today, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| I haven't seen the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| I haven't had a single call from any of these families telling me that they are now for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| And I'm not doubting Mr. Schmelzer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| I'm not representing that they are for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| I promised these folks I would vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| Now, Trey, I didn't know you were involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| But, irregardless, I promised these folks I would vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| And I guess I'm disappointed in the MPC with some of the comments I read in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1182)|
| 0:19:49| I mean, I'm pro-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| I mean, I don't think anybody has to guess in that with what I do for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| But I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| I'm not in favor of taking a neighborhood that we can see the aerial view of the neighborhood and put it in townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1198)|
| 0:20:07| And I'm not interested in what's across the street on Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| What's across the street on Westland, in my opinion, is a totally different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| that's almost a different world across the street there than what's on this side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| You know, I'm very familiar with this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| I knocked on a lot of doors in that area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| And I don't believe this is consistent with what you're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| I mean, that's my personal opinion as a builder, as a sometime developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| I just don't think it's consistent with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| I know there's others like Mr. Lambert, which will say that everyone has property rights and have the right to build anything they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1238)|
| 0:20:45| But I'm just saying that's what he, I mean, I know that's what he's going to state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| But I've got an issue when we go in and we change a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| I mean, these homes have been here for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| And I'm not saying what you've designed is not nice-looking stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| I'm just saying that I think that's the issue we've got in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| is that we'll take any piece of property, no matter where it is or what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| and as long as we can get enough stuff on it, then we'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| So I'm going to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| Laugh all you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| Yeah, I just wanted to say that, Mr. Daniels, you're not psychic and you don't know what I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Mr. Seymour, are these going to be rental units or are these going to be condominiums that are going to be owned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:38| They're going to be owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| They will be, the condominiums will be in the $200,000 to $300,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| Homes even higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| They have to be because of the cost of doing the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| And just for the record, if these had been rental units, I would have withdrawn my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| So you can't always predict what I'm going to do, but I'm going to stick with it because they're high-end condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| But I'm certainly against putting rental units in the middle of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| Commissioner DeFreeve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| Yes, I have a question for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| If there was 50 families asking for the denial, were they just merely in attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| or was there any content because there's no, normally when there's been response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| you've always included it in our packet, and I didn't see any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| Was there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| There was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| The gentleman that made that statement was at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| To be honest with you, I don't know if there were 50 families represented with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| or if he was a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| I don't recall if there was a large crowd or a large number of people there for that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| I may be wrong and I can stand to be corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| but there didn't appear to be a large number of folks there with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| I took it that he was representing a certain number of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| He says 50 families, and it was him and maybe a handful of other folks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| Buzz, how many times did this get changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| Wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| And he was notified that the meeting was today, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| Or he would know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| I believe we notify those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| We certainly tell the people at the beginning of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| we have information that we hand out as to when items at an MPC meeting will be considered at county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| So you had no email correspondence or faxes on this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| I don't recall receiving any since the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| and I don't think we had any prior to the MPC meeting or they would have been included in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| I just wanted to say that I'm kind of, if I was a developer and I came before this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| I honestly would not know if my development would go through or not because the way we vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| there's no consistency with anything that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| Last month, Mr. Seymour came here and put a development right next to White Oaks, which was Town Homes, correct, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:12| And everybody was in love with that idea and passed it no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| But suddenly today, and I received a call from Mr. Smeltzer, but Mr. Seymour, at the beginning of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| you said that you had resolved a lot of those issues at MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| You've shown us the concept plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| and I think it's going to be a nice addition to Westland if you are true to what you say, Mr. Benefield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1469)|
| 0:24:38| and I trust that you are going to do that because I drive by there every day and I'll show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1478)|
| 0:24:45| And let me add this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| I have not talked to Mr. Smeltzer since the MPC meeting, but Mr. Justice talked to him at the meeting, after the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:56| gave him his card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Have you all had any further discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Can I ask one more question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Now, are these going to be rental town homes or are they going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| No intention to rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| You have no intention to rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Want them to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| I'd like to address Mr. Daniel's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| I'd like to apologize to you and Ms. Davis about not bringing it to you sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| but we had two meetings with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Through those meetings, the opposition that did exist became very satisfied with the plan that we presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| and through the other conversation that we had with Mr. Smeltzer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| we understood that there was no opposition at this point, and if there is opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| clearly if we thought it was going to be controversial, we'd have talked with you in more detail ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| but honestly, we didn't see that it was a complicated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Well, Trey, it puts Elaine and I both in a very bad position when we see this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1547)|
| 0:25:55| You know, the rest of the commissioners, it don't matter to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| They don't have to go back and face these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| And I just, I mean, I've got an issue with the fact that, you know, when I make somebody a promise, I keep my promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1561)|
| 0:26:08| And, you know, I do know, Buzz, this thing was postponed several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| because they showed up one night to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| There was a whole room full of them to discuss this, and it was postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| and they were told it would come up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| So I know that night from all the phone calls I got on my personal line, which the Independent had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:30| or not the Independent, but the newspaper had published some time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| I got a bunch of personal phone calls on an unlisted home number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| I got cornered at Kroger's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| Everywhere I went, I got cornered on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| So that's my concern, is that they felt all along that this thing kept being pushed off and pushed off and pushed off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| so that the opposition would get tired and go away and there wouldn't be enough of them to show up at the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1610)|
| 0:26:58| And I know for a fact when Mr. Schmeltzer said there was 50 families that were asking for denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| he was representing that whole group of folks all the way around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| Now, if that has changed, that's fine, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| But, again, there's nothing here that tells me or makes me feel comfortable about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| Can I talk to the question about the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| We had the first neighborhood meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| And, like I say, we left the first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| We understood everybody was very satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| We came here and then opposition existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| Excuse me, to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| And we elected to postpone at that point because there was opposition we were unaware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| or there was issues to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| So at their request, we postponed one time for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| And they were notified when we were coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| And that was at the NPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| So there was only the one postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| And it was preceded and followed by a neighborhood meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| And, yeah, we offered to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| We truly have tried to work with the community to let them know what our intention is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| and to help them, you know, learn how the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| Are you finished, Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=1695)|

| 0:34:21| I just wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| Now, these are single family homes then, and it's going to be on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| That hasn't been determined at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2069)|

| 0:34:39| We do not have a concept plan at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| So it could be condominiums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2084)|

| 0:34:54| I know there are some physical constraints that will affect how we do the layout adjacent to the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2094)|
| 0:35:04| There's a blue line stream that goes through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| At least it's a blue line on the quad sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| We haven't had TDEC out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| At this point, we haven't had them out to look at it to make a determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| Once we get to rezoning, then we can start proceeding with some of the design details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| I'd like to see the design details first before I vote to rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| I'd like to see what you have planned to use for the land first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| And that way, Mr. Harmon, did you say that there was a lady that was opposed to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| You'll find the letter in your packet just before the MPC minutes and on the backside of the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2140)|
| 0:36:02| Can I make a substitute motion that we defer this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| until we can see exactly what they have designed for this piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| Yes, I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| Now we have a substitute motion on the floor to defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| I've got to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2180)|

| 0:36:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2190)|

| 0:37:20| I'll pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Motion passes 14 yes, 3 no, and 1 pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| 30 days to postpone deferment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| Let's see what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| 2-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| 2-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| We'll take 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2258)|

| 0:37:45| 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| 30-day deferment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| Next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Mr. Chairman, could I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| I'm Jim Lord, 3011 McCammon Road, Rockford, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:07| Planning Commission voted for this 15-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| It's simply a zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| And I see it as inconceivable that anybody who tries to rezone 49 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2295)|
| 0:38:24| is not going to have one person call up and make a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| It's a simple request to change it from agriculture to planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| wherein, as developers, we bring our plan back into MPC to show what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| I have no concept what Commissioner Davis is talking about on wanting a deferral on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:48| It just doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| We take our plan back to MPC for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| We got a 15-0 vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| What's the reason for this delay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| I mean, for one person to say that they don't want it rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| that's going to happen any time you try to rezone 49 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Yes, Mr. Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| Mr. Lord, come back a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| This delay of 30 days, financially, what will that cost you to delay this project 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2366)|
| 0:39:41| Rough estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| Well, if he doesn't have a concept plan, how can he find out what it's going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| It's not a requirement to ask for rezoning to have a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| That's up to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| We have to go back to MPC with a concept plan for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| That's what planned residential is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| You have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| This is not a debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| Well, I tell you what, I was on the winning side of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| and so I think I have the option of bringing it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| So I'd like to bring this back to a vote again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| and I want to ask Mr. Lord, financially, what is this going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| A motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| And I want to ask you, as part of that, what is it going to cost you to delay this for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| Not much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| Not much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| But time, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| Time is running out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| The development period, you know, when the weather is good, you understand the concepts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| But if I heard a reason for the delay, I would say okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| There's nobody here opposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| Everybody in the owner's association approved this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| They had no objection to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| Planning Commission voted 15-zip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| We have a motion on the floor to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| We have a motion to reconsider and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| I just want to hear from our colleagues in the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| I'm kind of following your list as your district, and so that's why I asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| Commissioner Hammond, I've had nobody opposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| This is the first I knew until this letter here was at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| But Mr. Lord is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| Nobody ever brings a concept plan before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| It goes to MPC, and then they present the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| I realize Ms. Davis is new here and doesn't understand the procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| but he used to present it with MPC, what he used to do with this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| and then they either vote to approve it or deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| Is that correct, Buzz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| I took a moment to read the letter, and the last sentence of the second paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:56| the author of the letter is saying they opposed six units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| and what MPC approved was five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| So the person may have been somewhat satisfied with the action of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| I have had the opportunity to speak with people with the South Dole Area Homeowners Association on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:26| and they did say that this is different than the initial parcel that Lord had brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:35| because this, going up to five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| is actually within and congruent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| And the parcel that they brought up before the South Dole Area Homeowners was against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:52| they were wanting commercial development, and it was only zoned for low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| So the only thing that would be concerning would be if having that much acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| would allow him to have a commercial couple of acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| Is that in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| It's not in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| And I repeat, the plan that we would submit, if it showed commercial, could be turned down by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2594)|
| 0:43:22| That's not a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| MPC can give you commercial based upon the number of units, but it's not guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| So, again, you have to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2612)|

| 0:49:18| Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| I think everybody here has had a chance to or at least has been given a copy of, I guess it came from the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:29| It's an amortization schedule paying off the TIF, the $460,120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:41| I do have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| When you do your drawdown of the bank loan and then the money that you're putting up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:56| would you be opposed to any drawdown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| Because I'm not sure how when the TIF portion is pulled as far as a drawdown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3000)|
| 0:50:09| would you have any opposition to that being last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| Because the interest doesn't accrue until you draw that part of your loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| So by it being the last part of your loan that you pull, then that would be less interest on that part of the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3018)|
| 0:50:30| So would you be opposed to doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| Because that's the motion I'm getting ready to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| Well, when you do a construction loan, you start a drawdown, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| You start drawing out on your line of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| And they don't start charging you interest as you draw that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| So if the last part of the loan that you pull out is the TIF, the $460,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| then the interest doesn't start to accrue until you start pulling that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| And the difference being it could be several months of interest on whether it's the first part that you draw out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| or the last part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| And it could be many thousands of dollars of interest if you were to agree to pull this out last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| It doesn't change as far as you getting the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3078)|
| 0:51:26| But it does save Knox County money because this is the part that the taxpayers are going to pay off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3086)|

| 0:51:40| Mr. Luthold, I think, as I understand it, first and foremost, this is a bank loan that we get from the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3100)|
| 0:51:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| And then you know how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| But the important point is when the tax assessor places the project in service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| So one of the things that can happen is we have to coordinate that with them as to when we take out our TIF loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| or else, you know, on the front end, we would have to pay that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| We would have to pay that year's debt service and then try and collect that at the end of the amortization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| It adds a complicated measure to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| I'm not sure that what you're proposing actually saves the taxpayers any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| The actual increase in the valuation saves the taxpayers the most because we pay off the TIF much earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| And that would be our intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| I understand that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| As the taxes go up, then that's more going towards the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| But as you start your project and you start, you have two loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| Basically, there's two loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| You have your bank loan and then you have the TIF part of it, which is another bank loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| but it's like having a second mortgage if you want to think of it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| As you draw down, as you need money to do your project, you can either draw money from the TIF part of it, the loan, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3178)|
| 0:53:09| to poor foundations or grade work or whatever, or you can do your bank loan, the other part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| which is the bulk of where you're getting your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| Like I said, because of when it's placed in service, I think it behooves us to borrow the TIF loan last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| That's what I'm requesting is that you borrow the TIF loan last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| Because if you take a look at the first line there in the first year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3212)|
| 0:53:40| I guess the assumption is that the principal and then the interest out of the $48,000, you have $28,757.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:51| If you were to take the assumption you're going to borrow the $460,000 for an entire year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| that's the amount of interest you would pay, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| But if you were to borrow this, say, six years down or six months down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| instead of you would only have that loan out for maybe six months versus 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| saving us maybe $14,000 in interest compared to what this is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| It's my understanding we have to go into contract with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| The agreement doesn't allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| Commissioner Don Peterson, KCDC, 901 Broadway, when he goes into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| when he sets up this project, he will go into a developer's agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| At that time, his clock starts ticking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| So he is on the hook from that point on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| And we've had this discussion with Commissioner Pinkson to make sure that these developers are on the clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3280)|
| 0:54:47| and they are the guarantors of these loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| So he needs to get that loan as soon as possible and start making his payments back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| Well, he's going to make one payment a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| Mr. Lutho, let me explain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Mr. Peterson, what he's trying to say, Mr. Petrie, is use your money first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| It's that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| Use your money and use the bank's money on the first construction loan first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| and then use the TIF last so that the time that you're talking about ticking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3315)|
| 0:55:22| until he actually makes a withdrawal from the bank for that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| You understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| It starts when he signs the developer's agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| No, the interest will start as he draws out that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| Because it's a bank, it's still a bank loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| and the bank won't start charging interest until he pulls it out and uses it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| Just because you have a line of credit out there, they don't start charging interest until you start pulling it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| So I'll make a motion to approve this with stipulation that the TIF loan not be drawn out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| until after the other bank loan and the developer's money has been used first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3354)|
| 0:56:04| Commissioner Lutho, we already have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| Well, I withdraw that and I make that as a substitute motion because I made the original substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| Mr. Lutho, can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| Do you agree to that, Commissioner Smith, to withdraw the original substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| To defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| That was the original substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| We're going to withdraw that and I'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| You agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| That's fine, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Mr. Lutho, let me say something first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| Let's get this clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| There may not be two loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| This loan may be all tied up together in one loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| Even though he is borrowing so much himself and the TIF is so much, the bank may just have it all lumped up together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| That way you can't tell what's TIF money and what's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| It would be our intention to draw that money last, like Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| Like you said, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| But I'm not sure the bank will allow us to draw the first loan fully before we start our TIF loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| I would prefer to start the TIF loan as late as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| That's my intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| My guess is the bank will want you to have that money with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| What's your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Well, how can you not have two loans and then hope to pay one of it off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3431)|
| 0:57:19| I mean, if it's all in one loan, how do you pay one off earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| You have to have two loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| We will have two loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| That's why I'm saying borrow the second loan to start withdrawing that line of credit after you have gone through the first loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3451)|
| 0:57:41| I think the bank may require the security of the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| Well, the TIF will be there, the opportunity to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| but you will exhaust the first loan line of credit before you get into this part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| And I think we need to start making that as part of every TIF that comes here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| because we shouldn't be forking over the interest as a project goes along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| We should be the last money to go in so that we incur the least amount of interest as far as the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3484)|
| 0:58:11| I agree with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| You ought to put that in the form of a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| I'll bring that next month, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| I just want to, Mr. Law Department, are we setting a precedent here against the other TIFs that we've done, done, done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:25| You will if you pass a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| But right now this one applies to this TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| I'm for the TIF, but I'm against the pulling this guy through the stringers out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| Mr. Petra, I think that the banks, you'll find that they're very creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| I think that they'll do that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| I did something similar to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| We have the two commitments already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| You know, there's lots of banks out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| KCDC, do you all do anything outside the city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Who would do something like this for someone out in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| The IDB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| IDB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| But the city has a city IDB board and then it's KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| Do you all have dual authority or is this through the city IDB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| This is just our authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| This has nothing to do with the city's IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| This is in our redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| John, doing what Commissioner Luthold said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| is that something that makes sense for the county to do, to respond to these folks, to do it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3572)|
| 0:59:41| Because I want to make sure people at home understand that we're not writing them a check for $460,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| No, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| Yeah, it would be real great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| So, really, there's no money exchanging hands with a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| It's just a guarantee of the note, which then he becomes a guarantor of it personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| We actually guarantee that the taxpayers are paying the debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| In 15 years, if you haven't paid it off, then you're on the hook for the balance personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:19| And, you know, I'm going to support a TIF one more time in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3619)|
| 1:00:27| But until we have some cooperation from not KCDC, since you're not, can't do it in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| but from other folks that need help in the county, it will be my last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3633)|
| 1:00:40| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| Mr. Petrie, I've thought an awful lot about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| And if I weigh your project on its own merits, I believe it's absolutely deserving of a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3646)|
| 1:00:53| And I don't believe that you've done anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| I'm going to vote for this, but I just want you to know that I do not want to see you coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| asking for a TIF on property that's been taken by eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| And I'd like to let our friends with the city and our friends with KCDC know that I'm going to throw up a huge fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3669)|
| 1:01:18| when you bring properties here that have been taken through eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| And this one was very sensitive because it's right next to one where the property owner claims that he's been threatened by developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:31| that they will use their political clout to force the sale of his property by eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| And I hope that the people that made those threats certainly don't have the power to carry them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3697)|
| 1:01:45| And I just want you all to be on notice that at least on the county side of this courthouse, we don't approve of eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3705)|
| 1:01:53| Commissioner Lambert, why don't you just bring a resolution forward that says we can't grant a TIF if eminent domain is used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| Sounds good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| Will you co-sponsor that with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| Be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| Anybody else want to get in on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| Mr. Petey, I just want to make sure, this financing plan, you're okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| Do you see any issues with your project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| It's a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| I want to see it get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| Is this going to be a snag in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| Can you live with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| I think I can live with it, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| The bank has given us two commitment letters, one for the primary construction loan, one for the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| I think they see the TIF as part of the equity portion that would support the construction loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:43| I don't see that that would be a problem, but I can't speak for the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| I sure hope it wouldn't be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| Commissioner Luther, could you say your resolution one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| That we're going to approve the TIF, but that he is to draw out his line of credit on his construction loan first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3778)|
| 1:03:09| before he draws out on the TIF loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| In other words, he's not using he will exhaust the funds that's in the construction side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:21| How much is that loan for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| Commissioner, can I make just one comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| I just want to direct this toward the law director, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| You want to be careful about adding amendments to this particular one since it's already been approved by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:40| Are we promoting having to go back before city council because of a change to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:48| He'd just be talking about the county's money, wouldn't he, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| If you're talking about a change to the agreement, then you can ask the city law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| but I would imagine that it would have to go back before the city right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| Well, it would save the city money, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| I would suggest they pick up the same resolution and save them some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| I don't advise the city, but this commission may make its motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| and it may cause you to go back before the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| It may very well do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| Mister, is it Petrie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| How long will it take you to build out this or get this construction done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3864)|
| 1:04:32| We've been told anywhere from nine to 14 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| We think more on the nine side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| We'd like to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| So if you didn't get to save this part of the funds that you need to finish out your project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| until at least six months in, instead of $28,000 of interest, we'll have about $14,000 of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3884)|
| 1:04:52| Mister Luthold, I would give you my word that I would attempt to do what you're asking me to do if that would suffice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:59| I'm a person of my word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| I'll keep my word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| But if I have to go back to city council, then I'm delayed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| I'm spending big architectural fees right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| And so if this doesn't work, we're out that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| We can't do that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| So I don't mean to complicate your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| I don't know when city council meets again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| And I'm not here to tell city council what to do or not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| But it's my job to make sure that I save as much money and taxpayer money as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| And I think it's a prudent thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| So I'm going to stick with my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| And I hope that it doesn't put you in a quandary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| A couple of questions that's been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| One was what's the amount of his construction loan, $625,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| No, that's actually the cost of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| My construction loan is $4.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| Then why is it saved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| That's the total cost of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| Total cost of the project is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| I'm reading the financing part of the KCDC letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| It's building loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| It's what the building is called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| But the TIF part of it is $460,000, Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| It looks like there's just going to be one loan guaranteed by the city and the county then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| It is two loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| I assure you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| There's a construction loan, which is the larger loan, and then there will be one TIF loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3991)|
| 1:06:39| which I guess is guaranteed by both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| That's what I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Yeah, but there's two loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| There's not three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| There's just two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| You don't have a city, a county, and then a construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| You just have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| So I would think this is maybe a little bit over tying of his hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| and that we probably just need to take the thing as it's given to us and either approve it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| Well, that's my substitute motion so people can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| Yeah, I was just wanting to make sure that was a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| You know, I think I'm going to vote against substitute motion, try to get back, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| I think going forward if we want to change things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| But since he's already been to city council, I hate to delay him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| How many yeses do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| Are you a yes, Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| One yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Now we go back to the original motion, which was to approve as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4062)|
| 1:07:49| Approve as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| I want to apologize for taking all evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| But you said that you will try to do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| I'm supposed to meet my kids at the beach, so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| Have fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| 920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| It's on page 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| This is a resolution requesting revenue review reports on a quarterly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| from the Knox County Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| What number are we on now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| 920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| Intergovernmental voted 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| 9-0 to approve, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| Just to see if this covers what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| John, you know, every month, like, the fee officers send the mayor a report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| the revenue, what the employees have made during that month, what's been paid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| And I don't know what you call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| They call it a Mike Ragsdale report, but I don't know the name of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| It's a financial recap, and they do, and it's in a different form for each office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| But, yeah, we do receive those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| The mayor's office does receive those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| Yeah, I was shown one this morning by the Registrar D's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| So could you make sure, could you send a copy to the commission office of everyone every month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4160)|
| 1:09:26| from the fee offices so we can see what fees they've generated for that month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| and what they've spent their money on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| If that's what the commission would like to see, then we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| Well, I'd like to see that on top of whatever else Commissioner Davis is requesting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| One of these we've done approved 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| Yes, I would like to make a friendly amendment to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| if this is agreeable to Commissioner Davis, is that there's several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| One, I'd like to see it to be a monthly report rather than a quarterly report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| Also, I would like to have our reports come with accrual accounting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| rather than the cash basis that we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| And then, thirdly, I would like to come up with a form on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| that is either a single sheet or maybe two sheets at the most that are very readable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4209)|
| 1:10:17| so we can follow the trends on this and we can set down sometime offline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| and try to come up with a form that's easier for us to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| I'd like to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| Do you agree to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| Just in case for people watching, we do provide a monthly report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| Commissioner Briggs and I have talked about some changes to that to improve that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| Commissioner Davis and I have talked about some of the things that she would like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| and we're happy to mold this because it's for the benefit of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| and so we want to make this a valuable report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| And I think rather than specifying this, I think what I'd rather do is just let this evolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| and what we can do is each month we'll try to make something that is going to be helpful to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| and then if you want to add, change, and delete, we can keep going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| and maybe over the course of three or four months we'll have just what you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| I think the monthly budget report is very helpful to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| but it's more as a reference than trying to thumb through the whole thing and see what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| But if we can just get some basic things so we can follow the trends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| especially over the concerns we talked about during the budget meeting on the trends of the revenue stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4285)|
| 1:11:32| in particular with the options tax, but we can look at that and the wills tax also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| I think the property taxes are a little bit more predictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| I'll accept his amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| I'll accept his friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| Yes, Commissioner Pinkston, you made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| Do you accept the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| Well, I was just going to say that I think from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| Hold on a second, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| Second, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| Yeah, I accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| For Dr. Briggs, I think that before we would make a commitment to accrual accounting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| I think I'd like to experiment on a few things before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| and let the commission see this and evaluate it without it being part of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4336)|
| 1:12:23| I think that's okay, and we'll see how we're going with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| but I just think it's awful hard if you don't take your expenses out of it until the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| You don't really have a good idea where you stand sometimes on the cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| But I'm willing to look at that, and I'll remove that portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| Yeah, just I guess I don't know who made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| John, I'd like to make this as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| What I just talked about a minute ago, whatever the fee office is saying, you just send it to us without change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| I mean, you can add it in your report, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| because it was just a two-page sheet that the register of deeds office had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| Just send it to us exactly how they send it to you, because it was very easy to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| Each office does their own report, and we can send that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| or we can ask the fee offices to send it to you direct and cut out the middleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4392)|
| 1:13:18| Either way, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| I just want to make sure that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| Yeah, just attach it and send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| Everyone clear on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| Well, I guess Commissioner Briggs had said that he would withdraw the changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| That one portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| That one portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| And I guess Commissioner Pinkston needs to agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| And I agree to it as a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| Everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| Resolution 923,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| the finance director to create a contingency accounting unit within the general budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| I would like to withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| Since we didn't accept that at the budget meeting, it really has no relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| So I think we might as well withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4446)|
| 1:14:15| Accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| Resolution 924 is requesting the Knox County Law Director to hire outside legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| pursuant to his authority as provided in Section 3.08 of the Knox County Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| to assist and advise the Knox County Commission in matters regarding the Knox County Auditor's Review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| of Mayor's Hospitality Account and Review of Community Grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| Resolution 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| Our budget, as I recall, Law Director, for next year for outside counsel is $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| Or $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| Or $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| If we hire outside legal counsel, what is the going rate per hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| Two and a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| So $225 per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| We don't really know how many hours we would be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| Really, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| We can just maybe estimate, but it's $225 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| Since we don't have the audit in hand and we have our law director and our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| do you feel we need outside counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| Would you want to write a check for outside counsel out of your account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| Not for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| You know, I'm willing to do whatever this body wishes, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| I was asked to draft the resolution to provide for this, and you all can explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4540)|
| 1:15:46| You all can talk about pros and cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| Would I stand in the way of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| Is it something that my office provides already as part of our service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4552)|
| 1:16:02| The answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| I drafted it basically to provide that if you voted for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4567)|
| 1:16:14| that the law director would select your counsel under the law director's authority in the statute in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4574)|
| 1:16:24| We could put certain parameters on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| We certainly don't wish to duplicate the efforts of an attorney that would review the audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4586)|
| 1:16:35| So, you know, we could put in, I could certainly build some restrictions within my retention of an attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4595)|
| 1:16:43| to make sure that doesn't occur so we're not duplicating services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| But it's whatever the will of this body is, you know, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| If you wish to have your own attorney for this purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| what I'll say publicly is that certainly that I will not stand in the way of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4619)|
| 1:17:06| Is it something that I would provide ordinarily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| That is part of the service of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| Being relatively new here on this body, Mr. Law Director, who represents the city council members legally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4642)|
| 1:17:38| They have somewhat a different arrangement than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| The city mayor is represented by the city law director, who is selected, I believe, by the city mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4664)|
| 1:17:57| The city council, as a result of that, has its own council to represent them at least during the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4677)|
| 1:18:09| As far as who would represent them in a lawsuit, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4689)|
| 1:18:15| It may be that they would be comfortable with the city law director's office representing their interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| because it would most of the time be one and the same as that along with the city mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4701)|
| 1:18:31| If a situation like this arose in the city council, who would the city council members ask represent them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4711)|
| 1:18:44| I can tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| That would be Charles Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| Well, they have retained the services of council to represent them at the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4728)|
| 1:18:54| and that would include advising them on matters that would come before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| It's a little different setup than counties usually have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| In Knox County, per your charter, per our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| the Knox County Law Director's Office represents all of the legal affairs of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| That includes this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| That includes the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| That includes the other officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| That includes the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| That includes all of the employees of Knox County in their official capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4766)|
| 1:19:33| It is only where we have certain divisions of our government that may disagree to where they wish to sue each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4773)|
| 1:19:46| for instance, school board or the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| where the law director's office obviously has a conflict and backs away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| The county commission would hire its own attorney and the school board would hire its.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| That's an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| That's occurred a couple of times over the past 18 years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| But typically we do not run into those conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| We are, I think, a very economical representative, legal representative for Knox County government, and it works very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4806)|
| 1:20:22| We have, there's been a lot of discussion over many years about counsel and who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4822)|
| 1:20:33| and, you know, doesn't the law director have a conflict whenever you have different officials, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4833)|
| 1:20:40| disagreeing about a certain matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| And the answer to that is no, not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| We certainly have legal opinions from the Board of Professional Responsibility that provides that county officials may disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4846)|
| 1:20:54| But the Knox County Law Director represents the legal interest of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| You are a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| You may disagree as to certain positions, but the Knox County Law Director's office represents Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4864)|
| 1:21:16| So in that way, I advise the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| I don't advise him personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| I don't advise him regarding matters that affects private life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| I don't give political advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| I give legal advice as to the legal affairs of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| And that's what I do here, and that's what I do virtually all day long and have for 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4897)|
| 1:21:44| Commissioner, new commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| I want to make one final comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| I won't be here sitting on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| but I think one day this commission is going to have to take a long, long, hard look about having their own legal council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4914)|
| 1:22:02| much like the city council has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| I don't know when that might be, but I see that there, in my opinion, there have been conflicts, especially regarding schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4926)|
| 1:22:17| And for you longer tenured people and the newly elected people that will sit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4937)|
| 1:22:23| I think one day you may need to seriously discuss this more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| That was going to be my question to the maker of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| What was expected by the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| Well, really what I was interested in seeing was I did feel that the public could construe this as a conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4960)|
| 1:22:48| since Mr. Owings does represent the mayor and us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| And this is a very serious matter, and we need to make sure that we're doing everything possible to assure the voters that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4972)|
| 1:23:02| conscientious and concerned and that all appearances of impropriety have been diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| I understand, you know, there isn't a cost associated with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| but I think that that cost is well worth it when you're putting the public's interest first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| And the law director does an excellent job, and I'm not trying to diminish his abilities whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| I think it's just very important that when we go through these audits that we're doing them as professionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5003)|
| 1:23:30| and as conscientious as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| And, you know, I may be interested in seeing the actual attorney asking some of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| so that we can remove some of the personality conflicts during the audit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| I was rather disappointed between the exchange last time that got personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| I think it detracted from actually talking about the issue at hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| and made it more about personalities, and that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| I'm going to support the resolution that Commissioner Davis has brought forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| and I agree with a lot of the comments of Commissioner Roundtree here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| I guess one of the things that I found disappointing about the hearings that we had over the PCARD audits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5055)|
| 1:24:22| and the travel audit is that the questioning we had seemed to be very disjointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5062)|
| 1:24:28| and we would start down one line and then someone's five minutes was up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| and then we went down another line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| And the truth of the matter is we're not very good at asking questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| in a logical and proceeding perhaps in the way that we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| There doesn't have to be an adversarial relationship between the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| and the mayor or whoever's representing him at the time of those hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| But if we do have someone who knows how to ask the questions where we can listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| we would have the opportunity to ask the questions also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| It's really where we have an advocate for the commission in asking those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| It might save a lot of time, and then we'll get all the questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| I have a substitute motion if it's legal to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| What I would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| We don't have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| Well, I want to make the motion that instead of hiring outside legal counsel to sit in the law director's chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5125)|
| 1:25:32| during this meeting, that we set up an independent counsel to hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| There are those of us on this commission that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| whenever there's an audit into things in the mayor's office that aggressively go after him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5142)|
| 1:25:49| And I think that the press has misconstrued that as a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| And then I think there's some folks on this commission that tend to be more defensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| They're more friendly toward the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| Now, I'm trying to be as neutral as possible in this, but I'll tell you, I'm just getting weary of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5161)|
| 1:26:08| One audit after another, and I think that no matter how we feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5168)|
| 1:26:16| that the perception is going to be that there's people going after the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| and the perception is going to be that there are people protecting the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| So I'd like to make the substitute motion that we hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| It's an original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| Well, I'd like to make the motion that we hire independent counsel to hear this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| and hear this completely and let them make the decision rather than us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| because I'm just, I don't know that I want to go through another audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| I don't want to go through the bickering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| I don't want to go through the fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| I think if we hire someone fresh and independent that it will be well worth the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| to let someone hear this case based on its merits and look into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| and let them make the decision if any laws have been broken rather than us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| So that's my motion, and I hope someone will second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| Hearing none, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| Well, I'd like to make a motion that we approve of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| And with a lot of the comments, it's already been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| And also, nothing against John Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| John Owens has been a great law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| and I've enjoyed working with him and taking his advice most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| Boy, some of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| Just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| But I think it is important, in eight weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| there will be a changing in the law director's office somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| like ten weeks or whatever it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| And we've seen in other audits that whoever it is requests more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| or we've got something else we want to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| And it would be nice if we had someone that's going to be sitting with us all the way through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| so we don't have Mr. Owens getting us part of the way through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| and then Mr. Lockett come in and then have to take up getting us through the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| So it would be nice to have someone that's with us the whole way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| And also, like Commissioner Briggs said, someone who knows how to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| because just as a police officer, an investigator knows the questions that ask a suspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| or when he's interviewing someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| And we don't know how to ask the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| We waste a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| And then the media outlets like to play it up real big that it's somebody against somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| I've got friends who support the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| I've got people who don't support the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| One thing about me, I support my friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| We already have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| I just want to make sure I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| Sometimes facts can be stubborn things, and I want to make sure I've got the facts correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| Mr. Law Director, when we had our meeting last time, that was not a formal 202H investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| As I recall, that was a meeting for us to have a meeting, to gather information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| and then determine what action we wanted to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| So the action that we took was to force the mayor to pay back any monies that were not properly documented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| and also there was a formal censor action, which was unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| So this body did take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| Now, if we are going to do a formal 202H investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| then I think the idea of an independent counsel or a lawyer is very appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5366)|
| 1:29:33| because if we do a formal 202H, it won't be anything like what we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| What you're talking about is everybody is going to bring in their lawyers, and it's going to get lawyered up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| and it's going to be a formal investigation where we're not going to, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| we may not be able to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| It's going to be turned over to the lawyer, and it's going to be more of a courtroom type environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| According to the procedure that we've adopted, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| So I just wanted to make sure, again, facts are stubborn things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| but I want to make sure we get all the facts on the table that if we're going to pursue the 202H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5403)|
| 1:30:09| then I think this is a very, very appropriate thing to do is to have a lawyer to assist us in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5409)|
| 1:30:14| But I think we need to make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| Just to bring in a lawyer and pay him $225 an hour just to kind of be here with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| if we haven't decided what action we're going to take, I don't really know that I can support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5421)|
| 1:30:27| But I can support the notion of, if we're going to go into this formal prospect, which, by the way, I think is a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| and I agree with my colleagues here that if we're going to go into this when the hospitality fund comes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| if there's a need for it, I think it needs to be more formal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| I think it needs to have more decorum than perhaps what was administered last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| So I'm ready to vote, but I just want to make sure I had that correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| Mr. Chairman, I just want to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| I don't think this resolution says we're doing a formal investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| This is just hiring outside counsel to be here with us and someone, and not saying this could happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5455)|
| 1:31:01| but you could see that there could be some questions that need to be asked of someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| But the law director represents both the administration as well as he does us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| And, you know, it puts somebody in a strange position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| And, you know, during the last audit, we put Mr. Walls, I think, in a strange position because he is more of an auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5476)|
| 1:31:23| The numbers are the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| It is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| And then we come back with a reasonable man standard, and we're asking this man to go back here and decide what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5486)|
| 1:31:32| And it makes it very difficult after we spent money after money going to the state comptroller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| and everybody else to get the numbers exactly right, what was missing, who was not following the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| And then we come back and once the audit was done, we changed it completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| I mean, we could have saved our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| So, I mean, I just think it's good to have someone that's going to be with us from start to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| I really agree with just about everything that everyone has said on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| But after going through the law, I would like it to have a little more structure when we do it this next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5521)|
| 1:32:08| To be perfectly frank, I think it was unfair to the mayor, particularly in the PCART audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5528)|
| 1:32:15| is where we may have gotten off track, and this is why having an advocate there would have helped the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5535)|
| 1:32:22| is that Mr. Walls made his presentation, then we started asking questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| and then we started passing resolutions to make him pay back things or to take certain actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| without the mayor really ever having an opportunity to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| And I think if we followed more of a structure where Mr. Walls presents, we have the opportunity to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5555)|
| 1:32:43| The mayor or his representative has the opportunity to make their case, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5563)|
| 1:32:50| and then there can be the rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| Then we have the opportunity to hear both sides of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| and then decide which way we want to go and to see if there's additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| And the reason I will support Commissioner Davis's resolution is because I think having someone there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| who can ask the questions in a stream where we don't go off track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| and don't go off on a tangent would make the whole process work, make it work more smoothly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| but also in the end it would be a more fair process to all parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5595)|
| 1:33:21| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| Thanks, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| Mr. Davis, this is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| Reading this, it says to assist and advise the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| in matters regarding the Knox County Auditor's Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| I take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| If we were to hire this guy, then he'll tell us whether we need a 202H thing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| He's going to advise us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| It would never matter, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| That's what I had hoped as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| See if we needed to go that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| He's going to advise us and tell us what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| I'm with you 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| I don't see any more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5643)|

| 1:34:08| We'll take a roll call vote in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| Please restate the motion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| Approve the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5658)|

| 1:34:31| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5671)|

| 1:34:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| 10-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| 10-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| Motion passes 10-8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| Motion passes 10-8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5700)|
| 1:35:07| 9-25 is the sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5707)|
| 1:35:15| This is a resolution amending the fiscal year 2008-2009 Knox County budget to provide $200,000 in funding for Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5715)|
| 1:35:27| Yes, this was the resolution that I asked for, and I guess first I would ask an opinion of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:35| Since we just approved the budget five days ago or so, do we need to wait to do this, or can we go ahead and act on this now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5735)|
| 1:35:44| Hold on a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5744)|
| 1:35:52| So you want to add another $200,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| Because we approved $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| Restore it to the $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| Restore it to the $400,000 that was originally requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| Is anybody here from ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| I don't know if Mike Edwards is here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| He left after the board vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| I'll tell you what let's do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| Let's defer this 30 days because I think we need Mike Edwards here, and it would also give the rest of us a chance to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5773)|
| 1:36:21| Well, now, I don't recall this coming up in the meeting, so I think we can hear this if you wanted to go through with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| We can hear it, but he wants to defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| Let's go ahead and defer it because I think he can make his argument about whether we need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5791)|
| 1:36:38| So granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| Mark Harmon's resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5801)|
| 1:36:54| You want to take each one individually, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| Resolution one is Knox County shall, on replacement of any vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| replace it with a small, compact, fuel‑efficient car, a vehicle in the top third of fuel economy ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| This provision shall not apply to patrol cars or CAC buses or vans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5829)|
| 1:37:16| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| How does this affect, like, the public works engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| I don't see where it would exclude their trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5847)|
| 1:37:32| Public works engineering has a number of very large vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| so if they were to replace some of them as they were out with some small ones, it won't be a problem, I would imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5855)|
| 1:37:44| The number of places where they have to go four wheeling into the woods is rather limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| It's not necessarily the four wheeling in the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| A lot of our equipment we do pothole repairs, so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| We have to have toolbox on our trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| We utilize a large number of pickup trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| On the building inspection side and probably certainly on the fire inspection side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| what you're talking about probably wouldn't be a problem, but certainly in the highway maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5886)|
| 1:38:11| just by virtue of the work we do, we've got to carry tools, a lot of tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| So you would like to exempt highway maintenance vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| Yes, sir, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| I would consider that a friendly and beneficial amendment and will be happy to alter my resolution such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5899)|
| 1:38:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| Did the second agree to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| You know, to do something like this without having all the players at the table, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5910)|
| 1:38:39| I think some of the office holders already buy hybrid cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| I know the sheriff's office has some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| I know the mayor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| Somewhere in general government we have some hybrid cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| Don't we, Mr. Arms, or do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| So I think our departments are trying to do what they can to make their fleet smaller and make it fuel efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5932)|
| 1:39:00| I don't know that we say in the top third that they've got to start reducing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5940)|
| 1:39:07| I think we need to leave that up to the people in charge in doing the day-to-day operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| So I'm going to make a substitute motion that we withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| We have a substitute motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| Oh, you have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| My question is, what about a safety issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| I mean, I know small vehicles go farther, but if you get hit in the side or something, it can kill somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5968)|
| 1:39:34| What a parliamentary procedure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| Isn't a withdraw the privilege of the person who makes the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| Isn't the proper motion to table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| No, any commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| Allow my director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| I think it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5987)|
| 1:39:57| Your question again, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| It's a parliamentary procedure question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| Isn't a withdraw the privilege of the maker of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| If you want to get rid of something, you have to table it or some other motion like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| What his motion really is is a motion to postpone, I guess, indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6006)|
| 1:40:12| That's probably what it sounds like to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| That's what a table would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| Other than a withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| Well, table it, postpone, whatever you want me to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| A table is often misused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| Basically what you're looking at is a motion to postpone indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| My motion is to postpone indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| Second agrees to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| Second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| I just want to say, as a car dealer, I feel like I know about as much about this as anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6043)|
| 1:40:54| You've got that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| Top third of fuel economy ratings, by whose scale, where, you know, that's very subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6056)|
| 1:41:04| No, it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| There's an EPA list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| Another thing, if you take that only into consideration, some of the more fuel, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6068)|
| 1:41:15| the cars with a higher fuel economy, the hybrids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| they have a very expensive replacement cost for the batteries that have to take place from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6079)|
| 1:41:25| and some of them are considerably more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| If you spend more for the car, it's the same effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| You spend more for the car, so you save a little on gas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| but you spent more for the car, so anything you saved, you wasted when you spent more on the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6095)|
| 1:41:42| Not really have a more valuable vehicle unless you have less pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| Commissioner Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| We don't need any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| I was going to say hybrids with bad batteries don't bring very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| Commissioner Davis, are we on the postponement indefinitely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6114)|
| 1:42:00| Can I ask a question with regard to the vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| I just wanted to ask, Mr. Harmon, would, you know, the library in between branches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6125)|
| 1:42:12| they have vans, book vans and bookmobiles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| and then I don't know if the health department has a vision van or a hearing van that they travel around to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6136)|
| 1:42:22| Would you be willing to accept those as exclusionary items as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| Because there are specific vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| I would think those vans are totally appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| But, you know, because my concern is any vehicle, and that's my issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| But otherwise, I like your idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| Commissioner, I like your idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| And after last meeting, I met with Mr. Walls and asked him if he would do an analysis of our fleet countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6164)|
| 1:42:50| He has agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| Part of what I have asked him to do is to do an analysis of the vehicles in each department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| to come back to us and report on what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| look at things like fuel efficiency, the age of the fleet, the makes of the automobiles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| are we buying automobiles that are the creme de la creme, the deluxe with the leather seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| and the heated, you know, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| He has agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| So we might be able to address a lot of these when that comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| But he has assured me he is going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| and I've asked him to get it to us as quickly as possible with an eye toward reducing the fleet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| and also making it more fuel efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| And so I don't know what his timetable would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| but I wanted you to know that I have requested that he has agreed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| Commissioner Harmon, is where you're going with this, is this with regards to the SUVs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6214)|
| 1:43:41| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| I mean, it's any very large fuel inefficient vehicle where a smaller, more fuel efficient vehicle will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6222)|
| 1:43:50| I think there's an answer for that with the Explorers or the Expeditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| and that would be an issue that I can take up at a later time for the sake of saving time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6235)|
| 1:44:04| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| And I agree with Mr. Hammond in terms of maybe he's alluding to something that's here in the near future consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6247)|
| 1:44:17| at least for fleets in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| And I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| Is there some way that, and this may be to Mr. Troyer, how it would affect our budget this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6260)|
| 1:44:27| replacements of existing vehicles at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| Are we going to be actively purchasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| I mean, what's the fleet look like in the near term as far as purchasing replacements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6276)|
| 1:44:43| I think what was approved in the budget is 44 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| Those 44 would be subject to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| So is there any way that we could, I mean, how would we go about emphasizing the need for economy in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6290)|
| 1:44:58| Is there anything that this body could do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6298)|
| 1:45:04| Well, you can pass a resolution and express the commission's intent for fuel efficiency as a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6304)|
| 1:45:17| 44 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| Commissioner Haven-Harmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| Yeah, this animal control, you know, we've got big trucks that have to go out and pick up animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| We've got a spay mobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| I mean, we've got to be real careful what we do to the county government as far as vehicles, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6326)|
| 1:45:32| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| I agree with Commissioner Harmon that we do need to, that's Mark Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| we do need to look at fuel efficiency and trying to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| Commissioner Harmon, I know I told you I'd like to see something, but hearing the debate tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6345)|
| 1:45:51| I agree with Commissioner Hammond, and I was wondering if you couldn't postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| until we hear back from the auditor and that we have a way to take a look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6356)|
| 1:46:03| since we keep hearing more and more exceptions that we would probably need to do with your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6363)|
| 1:46:13| I would be willing to withdraw if we could get some assurance that the auditor would present this at our next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| and deal specifically with the 44 vehicles that have been identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| That might be the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| Can you get it by next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| Can you do it that quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| I haven't actually started on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| Actually, I'm in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| No, I doubt I could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| I'm still in the middle of the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| You're looking at 1,500 vehicles that we already have, so I don't know that he could do that in 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| I'm just asking him to look at the 44 replacements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| If he could, you know, maybe if he could look at the ones that are on the table for this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| and try to figure out which ones could, or I don't know if that really needs to be him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| or if it should be purchasing, we could have a resolution possibly asking purchasing to make fuel economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6414)|
| 1:47:01| When they do their grading on which vehicles to purchase, they can make that a higher priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6421)|
| 1:47:08| I have a substitute motion that we pass a non-binding resolution telling our purchasing folks to strongly consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6428)|
| 1:47:18| fuel economy when purchasing these cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| The thing I want to, that I'm most concerned about, I appreciate what Mr. Harmon is trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6442)|
| 1:47:28| is I don't want us to buy a fleet of hybrids with very expensive batteries if we only consider fuel economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6448)|
| 1:47:36| and we buy a bunch of hybrids that have batteries that are very expensive to replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| when maybe an E85 rated vehicle or a biodiesel vehicle might have been a better choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6461)|
| 1:47:48| I think we need to look at fuel economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| I just don't believe that that needs to be the only consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| But if we made a non-binding resolution saying to consider fuel economy very important when replacing vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6475)|
| 1:48:03| yet still leave it up to Hugh and purchasing to make the final decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| I think that he would know our intent without us setting specific guidelines that have to be followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6488)|
| 1:48:16| whether it's a good idea or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| Thank you, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| Getting back to, I've heard, I've seen studies where hybrids are actually worse on the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6502)|
| 1:48:29| By the time you mine the materials it takes to make the batteries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| and by the time you dispose of the batteries, the savings in fuel, it doesn't outweigh it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6513)|
| 1:48:41| Now, I don't know if that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| The word hybrid does not appear in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| And I understand, but it could when you say top third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| They're the ones that are in the top third, the Priuses and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| There's not that many brands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| I mean, there's plenty of non-hybrid vans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| And I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| I just don't want to get maybe pegged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| But if we could maybe come back next month and see if we can't work out something, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6537)|
| 1:49:07| I'd be willing to pass sort of a resolution asking that purchasing take into account fuel efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6547)|
| 1:49:16| in purchasing these new 44 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| I'd be willing to make that motion tonight if we could get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| But I think we already have a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| Yeah, we already have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| Did you say you wanted to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| I offered to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| I think that probably should take precedence over any substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| Well, the substitute motion was to send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| To postpone it indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| Oh, that's the one on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| That's the one on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| I offered to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| If it gets back to me and you're going to withdraw, then I guess we can start taking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| Well, you had the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| Do you want to withdraw yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| If he's going to take it off, I'll withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| But I just want to remind everyone, most of these vehicles come with a job that someone has to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6594)|
| 1:50:00| I mean, there are probably a few out there that could be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| But, I mean, Bruce, you've got people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| I guess, do you have, like, supervisors that may drive a pickup truck home in case they're called out during the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6604)|
| 1:50:09| or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| Essentially, they're three-quarter ton trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| They basically look like south central belt trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| Stop right there for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| And I believe IRS guidelines probably, because we were running this somewhere a couple years ago talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6619)|
| 1:50:25| that say if it's with their jobs to have this truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6625)|
| 1:50:30| and they're doing something in a different car that they needed a truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| then they're going to be charged by IRS differently because if you've got a job, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6635)|
| 1:50:41| they were talking about it like trucks have got to have, like, a toolbox or different things on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| or they have to pay like it's something on their payroll, like it's a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| It works out to be about $3 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| And that was our interpretation of the IRS rules also is that they're exempt from having to pay this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| because they essentially have their work truck is a tool for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| Without it, they can't do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| So if you had supervisors that need truck and we put them in a Ford Focus, a ladder tied to the top of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| that probably doesn't meet the IRS guidelines for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| Actually, some of my supervisors couldn't fit in a Ford Focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6673)|
| 1:51:19| Now, Bruce, I fit in a Ford Focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6679)|
| 1:51:23| I withdraw my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| Ivan Harmon, you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| Commissioner, back to the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| You want to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| I'd be willing to withdraw with the expectation that we get a report and discussion next meeting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6693)|
| 1:51:40| Well, I'm going to go ahead and make a motion that we have purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6700)|
| 1:51:47| but high priority on fuel efficiency and purchasing these vehicles because they may be purchasing before we come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6707)|
| 1:51:54| next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| Let me get a second, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| I wouldn't have withdrawn if I knew something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| Well, it's just asking them to take that into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| Hold up, hold up, hold up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| It's not a mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| Do you second the withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| Both of them did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| Okay, Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| Just making a motion, a resolution, asking purchasing to take into fuel economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6735)|
| 1:52:26| when making their decisions to purchase a vehicle when applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6746)|
| 1:52:33| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| You have something, Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| I want to thank Mr. Harmon for bringing this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| Of course, I'm going to have to agree more with Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| What we should be looking at, some of these people have to have these four-wheel drive vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6764)|
| 1:52:49| but instead of driving expeditions and things like that, let's go down to escapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| They'll probably be cheaper, better fuel economy and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| So I'm going to go along with Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| We definitely need to look at our fleet and see where we can save the people money that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6780)|
| 1:53:05| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| Commissioner Lutho made it to ask the purchasing department, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6788)|
| 1:53:16| Asking the purchasing department to take into account fuel economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| when making decisions on the purchase of a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6800)|
| 1:53:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6807)|
| 1:53:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6808)|
| 1:53:29| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| Resolution two is that no individual assigned a Knox County vehicle should be able to charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6815)|
| 1:53:41| or acquire in any month more than $500 in gasoline paid by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6821)|
| 1:53:48| Mr. Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| Well, I see Commissioner Moore's light lit up, so if we're just going to pick these things apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| I can save all of us time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| Is that the preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| Then let's press forward and see if we can't get one or more of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6841)|
| 1:54:07| So you're making that as a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| We're making a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| A motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| You know, I spent 14 years in the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| and I can tell you back when gas was $2 a gallon, not $4 a gallon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| that patrol officers on the most time are going to run a tank full of gas out every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6860)|
| 1:54:27| that they're patrolling Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6867)|
| 1:54:31| It was a dollar when you were on patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| Well, whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| So if you think, you know, to fill up a tank full of gas, it's probably going to be $85 or $90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6875)|
| 1:54:40| And if you think that they can run all month on $500, I think they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| but we're going to see them parked instead of patrolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| And I think that, I mean, this is just in, you know, as the sheriff said the other day, this is insane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6887)|
| 1:54:53| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6893)|
| 1:54:56| Three words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6896)|
| 1:54:57| I hope I can make a friendly amendment that we exempt patrol cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| and we exempt, I'm trying to think of how to put this, working cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| cars that are being used for Knox County business versus cars that, well, you've got a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6906)|
| 1:55:13| All of them are supposed to be work cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| You know, people just drive here to the building and drive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| No, I'm saying that if a person, service vehicles, service vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6918)|
| 1:55:23| I mean, there's a difference in, say, Mr. Vandivate driving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| and I'll pick on him because we pass each other on their way home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| driving his car back and forth to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| and one of Mr. Weitrich's service vehicles, that if it's out burning gas, it's actually out working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6932)|
| 1:55:39| It's not a part of the pay package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| It's doing official county business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| So will you accept that as a friendly amendment that we exempt service vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6944)|
| 1:55:53| Commissioner Harman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| It's a friendly amendment for you to exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6959)|

| 1:56:15| Let's hear from Mark, too, from the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| If you're exempting service vehicles, I would take that as highway maintenance vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| and that's fine because, quite frankly, if my people aren't in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| they're sitting, they're not doing their job, then it's not getting done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=6986)|

| 2:03:03| Well, I'd like to beat you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| In light of what Mike Hammond says, that seems to be a more comprehensive report and we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7385)|
| 2:03:16| not substitute that for your resolution here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| I'm not sure the details of Hammond's report and how these two ideas compare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7399)|
| 2:03:24| Why aren't they complementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| We'll just have them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| Commissioner Harmon, could you wait until we receive that fleet information and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| have if there were reductions that were needed and necessary that you could ask that of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7415)|
| 2:03:41| departments and then they could compile that report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7421)|
| 2:03:44| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| I think she's asking you to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| I think she's asking me to delay this to three months from receipt of the report that Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| Hammond wants, which is fine by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7434)|
| 2:03:58| So you want to defer it three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7438)|
| 2:04:01| Let me start by just deferring it one month and see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7441)|
| 2:04:04| Yeah, let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7444)|
| 2:04:07| The second isn't willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:10| Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| Why don't you just withdraw and then you can bring it back at any time you wish and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| don't have to bring it back on a certain month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| If that's the case with withdrawals, I will withdraw it and bring it back at my leisure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7459)|
| 2:04:23| when I hope to see an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| Does that hurt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7466)|

| 2:05:19| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| I'm going to vote in favor of this to get it on the table for discussion on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7520)|
| 2:05:29| because it has to come back for second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| Is this also a charter change, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| Will this go on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7533)|
| 2:05:38| Bringing the fee offices under the control of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7538)|
| 2:05:44| Yeah, we've been looking at this and quite frankly, I'm going to need a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7544)|
| 2:05:52| time with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| At first blush, I think it probably is a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| You certainly have state law issues to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| You also have the Jordan decision by the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7562)|
| 2:06:08| You see virtually this very same thing in the NOX 1 petition groups, petitions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7568)|
| 2:06:17| they're going to be passing around basically to have the mayor be responsible for overseeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7577)|
| 2:06:29| all of these offices, to have directors for all of these offices, as well as there's language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| within those charter amendments to bring those offices fully within the commission budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7595)|
| 2:06:45| As I understand it, we still receive the budget information from those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7605)|
| 2:06:54| This commission has already voted to approve of their budgets, but if they wish to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7614)|
| 2:06:59| additional employees and salaries that are in addition to what this body has already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7619)|
| 2:07:09| approved, then they bring a salary suit and that suit goes to one of the courts of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7629)|
| 2:07:19| State law allows them to do that, so you pretty much have a conflict between state law and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| what our charter may ultimately provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| I'd like to have another month, really, to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| I do think that it may require a charter amendment, which is exactly what the Charter 1 group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7651)|
| 2:07:39| is attempting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7659)|
| 2:07:40| Do you want me to make a motion to defer it for 30 days then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7660)|
| 2:07:45| I would appreciate that, and we can bring it back whichever way we believe that it ought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7665)|
| 2:07:55| to be done, but it's most likely through a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7678)|
| 2:07:59| But, John, based upon the schedule, that would not make the August ballot, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7679)|
| 2:08:06| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| We're way beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7687)|
| 2:08:08| We would be in November, no matter what we do today or next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7688)|
| 2:08:14| Do we have a motion to defer for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7694)|

| 2:10:13| In paragraph E, it provides that the Knox County Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7813)|
| 2:10:20| shall be submitted charter amendments at least 60 days prior to a general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| Can we change that phrase, at least 60 days prior to a general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| to in accordance with state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7829)|
| 2:10:33| I think that's what we did with Commissioner Luthold's resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| and well with his ordinance and for a charter change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7837)|
| 2:10:41| and I think it makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| We both agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7845)|
| 2:10:46| Are you okay with that, Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7848)|

| 2:10:51| Whoever seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7853)|
| 2:10:54| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7854)|
| 2:10:58| Right now state law does provide it 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| And so if we leave it in accordance with state law and the state statute changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7862)|
| 2:11:06| then we don't have to go forth with another charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| and we won't have a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7871)|

| 2:12:15| Commissioner Lucco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| Yeah, John, will this interfere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7937)|
| 2:12:21| We're getting ready to have a meeting with the procurement on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7941)|
| 2:12:26| Does this affect what we're getting ready to do with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7946)|
| 2:12:30| No, this is independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7950)|
| 2:12:31| This is more on the numbering scheme, so this is all fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7960)|
| 2:12:41| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7961)|
| 2:12:42| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| In about a month we'll have an updated charter and code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7964)|
| 2:12:50| and it will be on the MuniCode site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7970)|
| 2:12:53| So we've been waiting on the approval of this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7973)|
| 2:12:58| And so it will be sent off tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| so we will have an updated code for the first time in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7980)|
| 2:13:10| Okay, we're on page 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7990)|
| 2:13:11| Ordinance 102 is adopting an epitome policy for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=7991)|

| 2:13:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8010)|
| 2:13:31| Probably moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8014)|
| 2:13:35| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8015)|
| 2:13:41| Yes, Mr. Chairman, before we get to public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| I'd ask earlier that the law director brief us on Chancellor Fantzler's hearing this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8023)|
| 2:13:47| with regards to our sunshine suit, if we could hear that now, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8027)|
| 2:13:51| The Chancellor did make a clarification this morning in the hearing, and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8031)|
| 2:13:59| and we can construe this narrowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8039)|
| 2:14:06| We've taken a very conservative approach to the Chancellor's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8046)|
| 2:14:11| but this morning he stated that he does not believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8051)|
| 2:14:16| and we're preparing an order for his signature for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8056)|
| 2:14:22| but he does not believe that two commissioners requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8062)|
| 2:14:29| or talking to each other about the scheduling of a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| not about the pros and cons of a matter that's going to be brought before the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8073)|
| 2:14:39| not about the particular matter itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8079)|
| 2:14:42| but about scheduling a meeting would not be a violation of the open meetings law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8082)|
| 2:14:51| So Commissioner DeFries and Commissioner Pinkston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8091)|
| 2:14:55| when you talk to ask each other are you available on a certain date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8095)|
| 2:15:01| the Chancellor does not believe that that is a violation of the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8101)|
| 2:15:06| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| However, his order to us seemed to be unclear, and now it has been clarified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8109)|
| 2:15:17| and we're preparing an order for him to sign related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| As far as the new law to allow us to, for you to freely exchange your thoughts and ideas online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8120)|
| 2:15:37| that the Chancellor said he had no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8137)|
| 2:15:44| We wanted to make certain that he didn't, and he doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| So we've had some conversations with Mr. Moran, who now that he still has a vehicle to drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8148)|
| 2:15:55| he's probably okay with working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8155)|
| 2:16:01| Dick, do you want to address it for just a second to tell them kind of what we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8161)|
| 2:16:08| You have a July 1st as the earliest start date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| but it's going to take a little while for IT to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8172)|
| 2:16:17| And we want to make sure that it's done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| This is a pilot program, so actually everyone in the state will be looking to see how we address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8180)|
| 2:16:26| how we develop it, and how well it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8186)|
| 2:16:30| Dick Moran, Director of IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8190)|
| 2:16:32| At the request of Mr. Owens and Ms. Stackhouse, we attended the hearing this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8192)|
| 2:16:37| and the judge gave us some direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8197)|
| 2:16:40| So we have looked preliminary at some of the solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8200)|
| 2:16:44| There are various ways to skin this cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8204)|
| 2:16:48| It's not rocket science, but there are some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| Obviously, there are three elements, I think, of the bill that have to be accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8212)|
| 2:16:57| One, we have to be able to provide a communication form for the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| We have to make it accessible to the public for viewing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8220)|
| 2:17:04| and we have to archive the data for a period of up to one year, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8224)|
| 2:17:11| And I certainly want to make sure that whatever we put out there is secure, it's fully tested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8231)|
| 2:17:16| it's user-friendly, and most important, it's probably cheap or free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8236)|
| 2:17:23| Economical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8243)|
| 2:17:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8244)|
| 2:17:25| Economical to make sure that it's something that we want to use before we invest anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8245)|
| 2:17:30| We will be looking at this heavily over the next few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| and I certainly welcome any ideas and thoughts that you all may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8254)|
| 2:17:40| I mean, we're looking at e-mail solutions versus non-e-mail solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| listservs versus bulletin boards and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| And we'll bring something back, maybe as a workshop or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| fairly soon to see how you like it and what you think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8270)|
| 2:17:56| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| Mr. Owens, if you could just give me some clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| and maybe I'm thinking too much into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8282)|
| 2:18:04| You probably are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8284)|
| 2:18:05| You're saying that two commissioners could discuss meeting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8285)|
| 2:18:09| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8289)|
| 2:18:10| And that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8290)|
| 2:18:11| Unless you notice your meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8295)|
| 2:18:16| But getting back to the special call meeting where none of us talked to anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| except the office staff to sign on for a special call meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| we didn't discuss what's going to be at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| and they ruled that was a violation of Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8308)|
| 2:18:32| And the judge today clarified that, and so this is a clarification by the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8312)|
| 2:18:38| That's one of the reasons why we took it back to the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| was the very conversation that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| But the judge doesn't have a lot of heartburn with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8324)|
| 2:18:47| and we're going to put it in the form of an order for the judge to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| So if you wish to call another commissioner to schedule a meeting, you may do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8331)|
| 2:18:56| Just don't talk about the pros and cons of whatever matter it may be prior to your meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8336)|
| 2:19:03| And that doesn't mean that just because you call another commissioner to see when they're available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8343)|
| 2:19:09| that doesn't mean that that is public notice or even when we get the website up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8349)|
| 2:19:15| if that's what we do, or the Internet access site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8355)|
| 2:19:19| whatever it is that IT comes up with for our use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8359)|
| 2:19:24| By you making a post to that site, that isn't sufficient notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8364)|
| 2:19:30| You still need Jolie to send out a public notice for whatever meeting it is that you wish to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8370)|
| 2:19:36| But if you just want to call and find out what Tank's schedule is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| or some other commissioner for the purpose of thinking about a certain date for a meeting, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8379)|
| 2:19:46| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8386)|
| 2:19:47| Just don't talk about the pros and cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| I want to have a meeting to discuss a certain budgetary item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8392)|
| 2:19:53| Just don't talk about the issues related to that budget item in your telephone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8393)|
| 2:19:58| That needs to be made in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8398)|
| 2:19:59| Well, I'm glad that finally we're getting some common sense, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8399)|
| 2:20:03| back to what people in a new school made such a big to-do over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8403)|
| 2:20:07| Aha, they signed on to a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| So hopefully we can all the year and a half of people talking about how wrong that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8410)|
| 2:20:19| maybe we'll finally get back to using common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| Well, I mentioned to Mary Ann, I said, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| if you have a telephone conversation with one commissioner to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8425)|
| 2:20:29| and that telephone conversation takes five minutes, then I told her, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:37| well, you've obviously talked about more during that conversation than just the scheduling of a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8437)|
| 2:20:43| And she said, well, no, if she and Susan Crabtree were to schedule a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| it might take ten minutes to decide, you know, when they were available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| But certainly your telephone records are susceptible to being subpoenaed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8451)|
| 2:20:58| I would keep most of my conversations very brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8458)|
| 2:21:02| and only discuss matters when they've been publicly noticed in a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8462)|
| 2:21:08| So in this case, Jody can make calls to commissioners to schedule a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8468)|
| 2:21:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| Scheduling a meeting is A-OK, says Chancellor Fensler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8477)|
| 2:21:22| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8482)|
| 2:21:28| I don't know if this is the proper time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| I'll sort of change the subject a little bit here before we get into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8489)|
| 2:21:35| Commissioner Hammond understands it's going to be bringing forth a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8495)|
| 2:21:42| to possibly deal with an increase in the sales tax next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8502)|
| 2:21:48| And since we're in a meeting now, just a suggestion, so if they're going to bring it forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8508)|
| 2:21:54| they can go ahead and start working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8514)|
| 2:21:58| I think it would be a wise idea to decide how much of those funds would be dedicated to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8518)|
| 2:22:07| and to ask the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut to join in those discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8527)|
| 2:22:15| so that we have a dedicated stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8535)|
| 2:22:18| Because if we don't have a dedicated stream, the city and the town of Farragut, by state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8538)|
| 2:22:24| only have to give half of that money to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8544)|
| 2:22:30| Right now, the city of Knoxville provides 72%, and I would hope that they would continue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8550)|
| 2:22:39| if there was more funds coming in through sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| because 80% of all sales tax is collected inside the city limits of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8564)|
| 2:22:50| And if we don't have that agreement, then we're not adding a whole lot to the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8570)|
| 2:22:56| but we are adding a whole lot to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8576)|
| 2:22:59| So just something to consider before that were to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8579)|
| 2:23:04| and maybe that's something that Mayor Ragsdale, maybe yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8584)|
| 2:23:10| could maybe try to negotiate some type of agreement with the city and the town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8590)|
| 2:23:16| before we get too far into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8596)|
| 2:23:19| Before I bring it before this body, I intend to have all of those questions answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8599)|
| 2:23:23| and, yes, I've got a lot of meetings set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| So I hope to bring it in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| It may be that I'm not ready in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| But before I do bring it forward, I want to have all those questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| You're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| I can't have this conversation with you outside of this meeting, so I wanted to have it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8613)|
| 2:23:39| Mr. Owens, in case I die, could I vote on that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8619)|
| 2:23:46| I'm not saying if I'm going to vote for it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| I'm just saying that that would be a very important question to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| Do you need some insurance for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| I didn't say that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8632)|
| 2:23:55| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8635)|
| 2:23:56| I've got a question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| John, is that, I thought the agreement between the city and us for the sales tax collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8639)|
| 2:24:04| it was a deal that was worked out for the county to take over the schools at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8644)|
| 2:24:11| because they were in such disrepair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8651)|
| 2:24:16| Well, it was part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8656)|
| 2:24:17| The city surrendered their school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8657)|
| 2:24:19| But agreed to pay the 72 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| And by virtue of the operation of law, Knox County received the city school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8661)|
| 2:24:28| with many of their buildings in need of vast repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| Actually, Commissioner Moore, when the last sales tax increase was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8673)|
| 2:24:39| the city had agreed to dedicate funds to the city school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8679)|
| 2:24:44| and we agreed to dedicate funds to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8684)|
| 2:24:49| But when the city went out of business, the school business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8689)|
| 2:24:53| then the courts ruled that the city's portion that they said was going to be dedicated to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8693)|
| 2:24:59| had to go convert not from the city schools but to the county schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8699)|
| 2:25:03| So they had agreed to up front to dedicate those to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8703)|
| 2:25:08| But at the time it was city schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8708)|
| 2:25:10| And then the courts ruled that they had to also send that money to the county schools when it combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8710)|
| 2:25:18| Well, we're now in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| We have four people that have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8720)|
| 2:25:28| Antonio Hinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8728)|
| 2:25:32| Chairman, did he find you, Chairman Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| I talked to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8735)|
| 2:25:36| He said that he didn't think he would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8739)|
| 2:25:40| He told me he had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8740)|
| 2:25:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8741)|
| 2:25:42| I wanted to make sure he didn't come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8742)|
| 2:25:45| The second person, Carol Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8745)|
| 2:25:53| The third person, Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8753)|
| 2:25:57| You have five minutes, Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| I'm going to let Mr. Len Mays speak before I speak, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8759)|
| 2:26:03| Len Mays can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8763)|
| 2:26:06| My name is Len Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8766)|
| 2:26:07| I reside at 10,017 West Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8767)|
| 2:26:11| I'm here about Natural Resources Recovery, Knox County Green Waste Facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8771)|
| 2:26:16| I've been before this commission body for the past three years and four months trying to eliminate an odor problem in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8776)|
| 2:26:25| When this odor first occurred back in February of 2005, the Director of Solid Waste, the Mayor's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8785)|
| 2:26:32| nobody would admit there was a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8792)|
| 2:26:35| March of 2005, a group of our neighborhood met with the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8795)|
| 2:26:40| The problem was, yeah, we've got a problem with odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8800)|
| 2:26:43| The Mayor said at that time, we're not extending past December 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8803)|
| 2:26:49| November 2005, another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| We can't correct the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| It's going to take us another two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| The community says we'll give you three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| March 2006, still a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8818)|
| 2:27:02| But nobody says they've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| It's cured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8825)|
| 2:27:06| We don't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8826)|
| 2:27:07| But we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8827)|
