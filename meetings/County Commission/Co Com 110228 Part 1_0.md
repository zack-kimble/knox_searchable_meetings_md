| 0:00:48| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=48)|
| 0:00:49| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=49)|
| 0:00:50| We do have a quorum present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=50)|
| 0:00:51| Commissioners, as I mentioned before, we have two resolutions and I believe that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=51)|
| 0:00:52| need to go ahead and take formal action that they be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=52)|
| 0:00:55| So let's take resolutions 101 and 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=55)|
| 0:00:58| Is there a motion that they be added to our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=58)|
| 0:01:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=60)|
| 0:01:01| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=62)|
| 0:01:03| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=63)|
| 0:01:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| The resolution with regards to Trevor Bain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| The mayor has that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| He'll be presenting it to Mr. Bain personally as they have the ceremony over at the Civic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=68)|
| 0:01:13| Coliseum shortly after 3 o'clock today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=73)|
| 0:01:16| With regards to the Bearden Middle School Boys basketball team, Commissioner Shouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| They're in school and we did not want to be accused of taking them away from their school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| duties obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| And so they will be here a little later and when they are here we will be happy to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| them at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| If that's okay with Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Thank you for the consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| This is a time we have set aside for non-agenda items with regards to public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| So is there anyone who would like to address us on anything that is not on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=104)|
| 0:01:52| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| While people jump up and rush to the forefront with their issues of public forum, let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=116)|
| 0:02:04| kill the dead time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| I can take up a moment or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| Earlier today we had the Commissioner's luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| Something was discussed about, and I'm going to go ahead and steal Commissioner Shouse's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| The Audit Committee meets tomorrow in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| One of the things that I'd like to say something about is that I receive from the University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| of Tennessee College of Business Administration a rather slick publication called Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=152)|
| 0:02:40| Archways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| This is their December, or excuse me, winter 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| And I wish that everyone at home could see what I'm doing as I'm turning past the inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| front page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| The contents, the first then full page, is a message from the Dean, but immediately facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| that in an article called Faculty Focus, there is a full page, nice picture of the Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=182)|
| 0:03:12| of the Audit Committee, Dr. Joe Carcello, and it's titled Testifying to the Truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=192)|
| 0:03:20| I'm not going to read out of this, but it's a full page dedicated to this individual who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=200)|
| 0:03:29| is serving Knox County by assisting us with our Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| And for anyone that would like to see it, I have it here available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| But for the members of commission, I really want to comment to the fact that we have excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| leadership on the Audit Committee, and I just can't let it slide by that I've received this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=226)|
| 0:03:54| publication and find a person that's helping us here in Knox County being so recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| And I'm glad that we came up with this idle air for me to say something about Dr. Carcello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=240)|
| 0:04:08| If you would give that to Jolie and let her make copies for all the commissioners, I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| We're very fortunate that he is willing to serve us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| And as Mr. Jarrett said, when you talk about a guy who wrote the book, he did write the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| And so we're very fortunate that he is willing to give of his time and service to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| He's a very valuable asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| Commissioner Shouse, did you want to weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| I was just going to add that there are five of us on the Audit Committee, Dr. Carcello,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=266)|
| 0:04:35| Mary, Commissioner Brawls, Commissioner Wright, and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| And we will have an in-depth discussion tomorrow about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| Commissioner Norman always comes to a lot of our meetings and invites any of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| commissioners in the public, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Our actuaries will be visiting our meeting tomorrow, and the chair or the executive director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| of our pension board, and we will be discussing some of the future liabilities, current and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| future liabilities of the Knox County Pension Plan, especially the so-called UOP, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| the Uniformed Officers Pension Plan, and what the future holds for that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| The city, as you may have heard, has a committee established to look at their pension funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| issues and how much that's going to grow, and the county may be on the same path to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| But anyway, it will be a very important and pertinent discussion tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| We also have some rather mundane things we go through, auditing school activity funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| and things like that, but it will be, I think, a very informative meeting tomorrow at 1 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| in this room, focusing on our pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| I hope some other commissioners can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| No one has asked to address us on public forum, so we are adjourned until 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=344)|
| 0:05:57| So, on Resolutions 101 and 102, is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=357)|
| 0:06:05| There is a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Thank you, Ms. Angie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| We need her, so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=371)|

| 0:15:22| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Our devotional today is from Commissioner Sam McKenzie, and after that, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Shouse will lead us in the Pledge of the Flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=924)|

| 0:15:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| I'd just like to ask the county to be in prayer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| Dear friend of mine, former colleague, used to be a former city council member, Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=934)|
| 0:15:41| Mark Brown, and the Brown and Stewart family, as they lost sisters, fairly young sisters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| within a week of each other, and they were both funeralized on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| So if you'd just kind of keep them in your prayers as you go along your way, I'd appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| Let's bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, thou who has brought us thus far on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| our way, thou who has by thy might led us into the light, keep us forever in our path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=971)|
| 0:16:19| we pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| Dear Father, we'd just like to thank you, Lord, for all that you've done for us, all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| that you're going to do, not because of anything that we've done, but because of your grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| I'd like to ask you to add a special blessing on this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| We may disagree with each other, Lord, but keep us from being disagreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| I'd like to ask you just to govern over us and our affairs, ask you to just keep us shadowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=998)|
| 0:16:46| beneath your mighty hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| And just ask you in closing, just, Lord, to keep three simple rules on our hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1008)|
| 0:16:55| Lord, first, Lord, to do no harm, to do good, and to love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| These things we ask in your name, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| Mr. Chaucey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Would everyone stand and face the flag, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1034)|
| 0:17:25| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| They have asked that we defer the approval of the minutes of the previous meeting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| Kim will be here with those at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| Do we have any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| I know this is not supposed to come up until the 6 o'clock meeting, but the Hillside plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| has created a tremendous amount of controversy over the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1071)|
| 0:17:59| This is typical whenever you have a committee working that nobody gets involved or most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| people don't get involved until you get down to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| But we haven't seen and either side has seen, I don't think right now, the details in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1087)|
| 0:18:14| I feel like it would be premature for us to further any further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| We spent three hours on it on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| I think the best thing for us to do, and I'd like to make a motion that we postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| for 60 days and that you or somebody appoints a committee to sit down with both sides, look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| at this, and try to come back with a compromise that we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Is that on the zoning agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| Can we hear it, especially since it's a different meeting, can we hear that amendment change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| Well, if you were attempting to shorten the time, thereby depriving people of due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1131)|
| 0:18:59| to appear, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| If you're going to just consider it merely to discuss whether or not you want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| it a more appropriate time, you can do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| What you can't do is, at this juncture, pass it or deny it, or in the alternative, modify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1148)|
| 0:19:17| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| If it's just merely to debate whether or not you want to discuss it at a later date, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| can do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Is there a second to Commissioner Brown's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Okay, the motion is made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| Okay, this obviously, and I can see some of the benefit of postponing this from our perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1176)|
| 0:19:46| and of course, we've gotten into a little bit more of a campaign than I realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:55| I guess the worst mistake I ever made last week was saying, well, this is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| over last Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| What a gross underestimation that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| But, I mean, I have, I hope that, you know, I'd hope tonight that we, and we have planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1209)|
| 0:20:18| you know, we had planned a, some more of a presentation on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| We have people that are some very influential people we think that are, had planned to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| but, in favor of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| But, if we postpone it now, then that gives them word that they don't have to come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1234)|
| 0:20:41| here in this thunderstorm and risk their lives to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| So, I guess that, from that point, I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| I don't know about the other side of that, Mr. Brown, as far as appointing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1251)|
| 0:20:58| to evaluate the, I mean, I don't know where that's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| I mean, I would be just fine with just an outright 60-day postponement without any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| stipulation as to what is going to be done next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1270)|
| 0:21:18| The cooling off period is a good concept, but I don't know, I mean, I can't evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1278)|
| 0:21:27| what else that we could do that would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| I mean, we're going to, maybe we have another workshop, because the previous workshop was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1291)|
| 0:21:39| kind of not a workshop, it was a public hearing, and so we could set up another workshop that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1299)|
| 0:21:48| really focused on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| I think it's going to take more than one, Commissioner Norman, and my vision would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| possibly a couple of commissioners, a couple of city council people, you know, experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| in different fields who deal with these type issues all the time, getting, setting down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| putting their heads together, coming up with some suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| You know, I'm a firm believer in planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| I've been working for 38 years on zoning matters, and I believe in planning, and I believe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| good planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| But there's just too much controversy right now, too much negative stuff that this just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| needs to be re-looked at, re-vetted, some detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| You've heard the expression, the devil's in the details, and we did not get those details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| on Tuesday, and I feel like that probably 75 percent of the antis at this point don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| know the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| And that's, now that we've got everybody awake, maybe they will come to these workshops so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| they can get these details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| That's my point right there, is getting the details out to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| And, I mean, I agree with you about details, and there was, we definitely needed to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1376)|
| 0:23:04| some, or provide part of the presentation for more, one or two more aspects of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:14| and indeed, details is, God's in the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| I like God being in the details more than the devil, but he will have that opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| and I can go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| I can go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| Commissioners, if we could, I know a lot of you want to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| Our mayor has asked a special privilege that we go ahead and address the police vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| He does need to leave and be at the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| If it's okay, I'd like to suspend for a moment the discussion on this motion, if that's okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:47| with everybody, because I want to give everybody a chance to speak, but I want to be respectful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| to the mayor in his time, because this is an important matter as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| Is that okay with commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| We are coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Are we going to set the agenda first, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| So are there any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| We will add this as an amendment to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| So can I have a motion that we add what needs to be added, and delete what needs to be deleted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| The motion has been made in second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| I want to move item number 905 and hear that now, which has to do with the appropriation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| of monies from the general fund for the purchase of members of the sheriff's fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1464)|
| 0:24:31| It's on page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| So clerk, would you read that item, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| Resolution 905, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| regarding the Knox County Sheriff's Vehicle Fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| The motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Mayor Burchett, you're asked to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| And if you'd come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, Tim Burchett, 6401 Ayrtree Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1494)|
| 0:25:06| I've come for a lot of reasons, but I oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1506)|
| 0:25:13| My first question I have is the wording of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| I was going to ask the law director about how open-ended is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| Is there specifics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| I know we've talked about 100 vehicles, but I wanted to make sure that that's where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1525)|
| 0:25:33| numbers were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, Mr. Mayor, the information in the resolution is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| the only information that was provided, so I don't actually have a dollar figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| Or a number of vehicle figure, I guess, is what I was concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| It was my understanding it was 100 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Isn't that specified in the resolution, Joe, 100 vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| I heard the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| I don't recall if we actually put in the exact number of the vehicles, because I wasn't sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| if we actually had a definitive figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| What we've been discussing is 100 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| That's what we discussed at the work session, and that's what we are appropriating for is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| 100 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| That would be the, you know, the Commission, certainly, if that's the intent of the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| 100 vehicles, is what the Commission is looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| It's not written in the resolution, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| That was my first concern, and I was wondering if that was normal procedure, or did we put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| some specifics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| Not that I don't infinitely trust our Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| No, it needs to be specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| If that could be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| As the maker of the motion to approve, I'll address it as, be specific in the, or amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:52| it to no more than 100 police vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| With the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| And what is the dollar figure we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| I think the preliminary was no more than 3.1 or 3.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| What was the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| I just passed out information to all, or Jolie just passed out for me information to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| the Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| It's 100 Foreign Crown Victorias plus the emergency equipment at the cost of $3,437,849| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1637)|
| 0:27:28| for the total appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| That's $22,229 for each vehicle, plus $12,149.49 for the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1652)|
| 0:27:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Let me, before I get more specific with the dollar amount, can I, Sheriff, can I ask your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| or Allison, either one, a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| Mr. Chairman, you did have a motion and a second to orally amend the resolution so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| reflects 100 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| You may want to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Well, let me, there wasn't a dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Allison, when we first discussed this, the equipment amount was $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| Why has it gone up $2,000 a car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| When we went back and totaled everything that we used for the vehicles, which include the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| digital cameras and the laptops and the stands, it came right at $12,149.49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| That includes everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| And all of that information was provided to each Commissioner before Tuesday's work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| When we met on Friday, we just gave an estimate, but when we went back and totaled everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| that's what it came to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| The amendment should read 100 vehicles at $3.4 million, 3.437849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1719)|
| 0:28:48| No more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| And so that's what the, that's what the resolution will read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| So that's your, you've amended your motion to include the figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Mayor Burchett, you had said that, I'm going to ask you this, you said you were opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Can you tell us more of the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| I think financially, first of all, it sends the wrong message to the rating agencies and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| to others that we take money from reserves for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| We're in the middle of a budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| Last year, I believe, it was asked for 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| We're going to actually to Nashville for this, which I think in the past, we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| these things by, we found, well, you all have found in prior times that actually it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1770)|
| 0:29:38| it was actually, we came out cheaper under bids and I realized the situation with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| Crown VIX and that they're going to discontinue them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| I read one thing that they were discontinuing in 2000, November 11th, 2009 was the first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| the earliest I found that they were talking about, they were going to discontinue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| So, I think midterm in a financial year is a bad, I think it sets a bad precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1795)|
| 0:30:03| We have these budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| We go through this process and I just don't think it's the right way to go about our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1805)|
| 0:30:12| It's not a, our reserves are just that, reserves, and we need to make sure that when we set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:20| this precedent that it should be for emergency type situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| I know the argument can be made that these are emergencies for emergency vehicles, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| but I just think it sets the wrong tone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| I think that's what you're seeing across the country right now as folks are angry with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| expenditures and that I think that if we just put this through the normal budgetary process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| that I think that we'd probably come out with a better result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| I realize, you know, I spent 16 years in Nashville and I realize where I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| vote's going to be, but I just think it's important to me that I am the chief financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| officer of this 600 some odd million dollar corporation that we all take a part in running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| that I have to firmly oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| You know, I'm just, John Troyer, I may have a question for you, and my question as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| come is how does our cash reserves affect our bond rating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1883)|
| 0:31:31| I know we've had like two bump ups in our bond rating since I've been on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| so since 2008 we've had two improved ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| How would, in general, because we don't know what you're going to be asking for from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| cash reserves, how does that rainy day fund or cash reserve, general fund, whatever you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| want to call it, how does that affect the bond rating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Could I address part of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| Please, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| That is part of what they look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| They look at our fiscal responsibility for like, I'm sure there's a more technical term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| but they look at that as it's not a wish list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| It is what we truly treat it as is for emergency type situations, in my opinion, and so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| that they will, granted, a lot of folks don't pay much attention to what bonding ratings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| do in the general public, but in the real nuts and bolts of running county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| that is, I think, very important to our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| And Troyer, you want to, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| And, you know, I guess along those same lines, the biggest reason I'm not comfortable at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:45| is I don't know where you guys are going to go from a, you know, budgetary standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:52| So that's why I kind of mentioned to Dean I would like to get a flavor of where the, I know we're early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1972)|
| 0:33:00| in the process, but I'd like to get a flavor of where this year's budget is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| You know, I'd hate to make a blind vote and we'll end up, because a lot of people don't want to dip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1986)|
| 0:33:14| into the cash reserve, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| I'm one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| But there's some programs that I want to see the county continue with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| So it's a blend from, you know, public safety to health to parks and rec to the whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| that we have to consider, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| Commissioner McKenzie, we're just starting the budgetary process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| Of course, we'll present our budget, I guess, May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| So to answer your question, we are just starting that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| And then I guess in terms of a question, I don't know if it will go to JJ or maybe the maker of the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| the creator of the motion, the maker of the motion, and that is why 100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| We didn't, in my opinion, we didn't, and this is messy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| I understand that our fleet isn't what we'd like it to be, isn't what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| and will only deteriorate in time, but why such a big number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| A hundred is a huge number in terms of vehicle turnover in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| And, you know, 100 at, no, it's $3.4 million at one time, a one-time hit to our general fund for what's 3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:36| That's basically $3.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| And why such a large number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| And can we look at a phased approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| Like I said, we didn't dig ourselves in this hole in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| Why dig ourselves back out in one year at such a huge cost to potentially other areas of the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2088)|
| 0:34:56| I think you hit the nail on the head, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| The reason we're in this hole is in the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| we've got 74 cars comparable to the city who has 279 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| Some people don't like to compare to the city, but they're our sister agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| and the same demographics apply to the city as apply to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| So the comparison, I think, is fair, which shows that we're 205 cars down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| With 100 in cars this year, no cars budgeted for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| then after that the next three years at 45 vehicles a year will put us back on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| in the rotation that we should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| We've asked for over $304 million worth of cars in the last three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| and have received less than 900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| That's the reason we're in the position we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| We've cut for the last three years and we can't cut anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| There's no more dire need for these vehicles at any time ever besides now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| This is an emergency plus an opportunity, an opportunity to get these cars that won't be made anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2157)|
| 0:36:05| for a $4,000 a year cheaper price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| This is a well-thought-out plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| It cannot do anything but save Knox County taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| I have a question and it would really go to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| I don't know who's answering those questions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:30| If the mayor or the finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| Yeah, what my question is, is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| I agree with a lot of the points you made about we need to save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| It's a tough year, but we also have to have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| I think everyone would agree at some point we've got to replace the cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| They just don't go indefinitely and there's expenses that go along with maintaining cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| This is just like a family that has an old car and times are tough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| and we're trying to decide do we send it out for more repairs or is it time to get a new one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| But even as a bigger issue than that is what is the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| You know, what is the plan that the administration has over the next several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| for replacing the vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| I mean, we all agree they're going to wear out at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| and we all agree that it costs a lot to maintain them, but what is the rotation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| or what do you propose is the rotation plan to buy the cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| And like I said, I want to ask J.J. the same thing in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| And, you know, it's got to be something we can afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| We don't want to waste money on repairs, but we also have to have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| We can't say that, well, we need 100 cars and then we don't have a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| or we can't say we're going to deny 100 cars and not have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| We're going to need new cars, but what's the plan over the next several years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| This is like planning a capital expense to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2264)|
| 0:37:51| Well, last year they asked for 45 and I believe they were, this is all from prior administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| they were given 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| So by my calculations, 26 cars, more cars would have fully funded their request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2281)|
| 0:38:11| So, you know, as I've stated before, we have to take these suggestions from these departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| and it's obviously Sheriff Jones, it's his job to get the best he can for his people and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2298)|
| 0:38:27| What is the size of the total fleet of patrol, of these type of vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| You're talking about marked patrol vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| Yeah, that's because of what we're talking about buying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| Yeah, there are 278 marked vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| I'm not real good, like Dr. McIntyre, I'm not real good at public math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| but if you take 20 into 200 on the schedule we're doing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| that means these vehicles have to last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| Yeah, it's about 278 right now, 125 of them have over 100,000 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| So that's roughly, you know, you're talking about 45, 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| Well, even if you don't take those over, let's say they were all brand new vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| and we've got just a tad less than 300, you know, you divide, I'll let somebody do it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:19| you divide 20 into, well, you divide 20 into 200, that's ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| You divide 20 into 300, that's going to be a lot more than that that you need every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| The way we figured it out, if you stay on that 45, 55 rotation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| which is 100 cars every two years, then you're able to maintain and trade out vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| I guess what I'm asking the administration, what do you propose doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| I mean, because the cars are going to wear out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Well, we're going to have to take their suggestions, but like I stated before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| they asked for 45 last year and were given 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| So 26 cars at this point would totally fulfill that wish list from the way I figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| Well, from last year, but this year they have another 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| If you do that rotation that the sheriff was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| Well, that's obviously what the budget process is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| I guess what I'm saying, though, is that what that means is that we're up in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| even if we just keep on that rotation from last year, not giving them what they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| we're still looking at about 50 or 60 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| I mean, it's going to be a constant thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| It's not like somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| This is like a rotating capital expense that we know we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| And as I stated, that's what we have the budgetary process for, not midstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| That's why the process comes up a yearly thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| If we don't, then we can just say we've got this amount of money, and then when something comes along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| we just vote it in at the will of six commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| If I could, could I ask J.J. now just for the fairness of picking on somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| But anyway, J.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| That's part of our jobs, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| We get picked on a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| My question to you, then, is if you think we need about 45 cars, you got shorted, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2466)|
| 0:41:13| 26 last year, and you're going to need 45 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| Plus the ones we got shorted the year before, plus the ones we got shorted the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| This is a three-year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| I think one of the most important things that we're not missing is these vehicles are not going to go into production| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| until September, the new vehicles, which puts it out of about a delivery date of 120 days out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| So what we're talking about is if we don't buy these Crown Vics today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| we're not going to be able to get new vehicles until sometime this month next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| which takes the vehicles and adds another 28,000 or 30,000 miles to the vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| which now put vehicles up over 120,000 and 150,000 miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| takes the vehicles now that are 75,000 and puts them up over 100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| to where this time next year about 64% of our fleet will have over 100,000 miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2519)|
| 0:42:07| and of that 64%, 47% of them will have over 125,000 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:14| The maintenance for those types of high mileage vehicles doing police work is astronomical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| The maintenance budget will go through the roof, and some of them won't be able to be fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| because there's no use to spend $4,000 or $5,000 on a $1,000 car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| I think that's the key point that we need to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| If those cars were available in June, it may be something a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| We also have to remember they're $4,000 a piece more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| But we're talking about 12 to 14 months away before any vehicles could be readied and delivered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| which takes an already overburdened high mileage fleet into numbers that are beginning to be not safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:54| for our men and women who drive these vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| And I certainly don't want to be put in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| You know, I guess what the point I'm trying to make, you know, for both sides here is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| you say we need 45 new vehicles a year, 50 new vehicles a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| I believe you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| You got shorted last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| I believe you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| We're going to need this many next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| I believe you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| And it's the same way with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| I mean, what's going to be there looking at, let's say, a five-year budget to buy cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| What is their plan over five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| I mean, how many do you think we're going to buy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| They just say we can't buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| I'm not talking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| I mean, I'm not asking you because I know you don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| But I want to know what their plan is, is if we don't get some of these vehicles now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| I don't know if we need 100, but I just want to know what is the plan and is there any merit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| And I'm asking this as someone who hasn't made up their mind about this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Is there any merit to try to save $4,000 a vehicle if we're buying them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| Well, we're not even six months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| We're four months until the new fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| And then even if we get them now and then taking that off of some of the vehicles that we normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| would plan next year because we could get them cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| I think we're talking on the $4,000 difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| So that's not the crown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| That's the new vehicle with the Vortex 6 Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| It's the new crown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| The new crown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Are you talking about the new crown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Well, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| It actually proves my point about the hearings that we're conducting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| I mean, that's the process that we are going through, and that's what we're asking you to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| is allow us to go through these procedures so that we can make some sort of decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:29| Making a decision, a budgetary decision, like this in the middle of the term, it's just a bad precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| You know, to be honest with you, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| But, you know, there's so many uncertainties here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| And what I'm trying to come up with a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| I mean, 100 may be too many, but maybe we need 50 or 60 to let that cover what you got shorted last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2683)|
| 0:44:50| and let, and if you need, I know you need more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| I know you need more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| I see back there shaking your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| I know you need more, but that would cover the 50 for next year until we can come up with a five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| And that's what I, you know, that's what I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| I just told the sheriff if he needed 100, he should ask for 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| I mean, I understand how the game is played, Doctor, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| But see, what I'm saying is that I think he probably, if you really look at the schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| the rotation schedule where you need vehicles, you take some of those out of fleet services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| you've got to put new vehicles in, probably 40 or 50 vehicles a year is not unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| And you didn't get short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| If that was a substitute motion, I would second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| I think the reason that we're talking about 100 vehicles is we were lucky to find a dealership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| that still had 100 vehicles left and with the ability to buy those 100 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| If we do 50, then, of course, we're going to need 50 more next year at the higher price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| an untested model of vehicle and those type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| So I think that's the number 100 is we were lucky to find that 100 plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| Next year we wouldn't need anything on untested vehicles that we didn't know anything about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| plus that were $4,000 more a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| I'm going to stop now because I know there's other people that want to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| but that was just the point I wanted to make on this is that, you know, if this is really a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| you know, we ought to consider it or consider part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| And even if we're pushing some of the budget over to next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| I'm not going to make any substitute motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| I'll let somebody else look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| But, you know, I appreciate both of your positions, but I do agree we need to have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| I don't like doing things in the middle of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| But on the other hand, you know, I don't think an absolute no is a good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| I don't know how many we need, and that's what we have to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| Every commissioner, except for Commissioner Owen, if I'm correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| voted for this budget that had this number of vehicles in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| So it's not a ñ it shouldn't come as any surprise, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| But that's up to commission to decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| We keep going back to we voted this in to our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| But this is kind of a perfect storm in the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| I hate taking money out of the unfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| You know, you guys know that when I talk about budgets and I ask John Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| how much is in undesignated, how much debt did we pay off, and where are we going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| That's how I kind of put my determination on how I'm going to vote for the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| That's the preliminary part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| What you have is Ford is, for the public's information, most of you guys know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| Ford is going to stop making that vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| And if you're going to test or if you're going to buy, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| Chevrolet is going to build a new car, Ford is going to build a new car, and Dodge has redesigned their car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| All those cars are probably going to cost your fleet $3,000 to $4,000 a piece more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| And so even if you just did nothing today and bought 100 or 50, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| if you bought 100 of them in the next budget year, you're looking at 400 more thousand dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| plus the $200,000 we're spending on, I say unnecessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| when you take the maintenance of a car and you take away the batteries, the tires, the brakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| and the oil changes, you take all that away, and when you're replacing suspensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| and you're replacing the things that go wrong on police cars that are detrimental to a police car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| when you start replacing those, it's not cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| Anything that's unordinary is the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| We spent, I think, $170,000 last year, Allison, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| in things other than normal maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| And so, and in my opinion, I mean, the city did this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| The city bought 120, 19, 17 cars this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| And what they did was they said Ford's not going to make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| We don't want a first-year production car because all three of them are brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| And so they're untested on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| And so this gives the opportunity for other agencies that are not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| that don't have money in the bank, really, to go and buy these first-year cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| and give us a prognosis on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| And Michigan State Police will take them for a year and beat them down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| and see how good of a car they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| And so I don't like taking money out of the undesignated fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| It's important to me that we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| But I think that this is an opportunity to catch the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| I mean, a police car is not a luxury item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| I don't know where this came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| I mean, if we hire somebody, we give them a gun and a bulletproof vest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| because we expect them to face danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| We've got to give them a way to get to the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| And we've got to give them a reliable way to get to the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| It's not going to cost the county a lot of money over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| And, Sheriff, can I ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Can I ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| Will you assure everybody that these will be marked cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| and none will be assigned to the detective bureau and such?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Yeah, my assurance is that they will be marked patrol vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| They will be on rotations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| I think this, going back to what Dr. Briggs says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| this sets up the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| This year it's 100, next year it's zero, and then we go to 45 to 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| That gets us back where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| It's embarrassing to see an old, old car in a county that's as nice as Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| We're the third largest in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| We have these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| We need to have a premier sheriff's department, and we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| But we need to outfit these ladies and gentlemen and make them proud to wear that uniform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| and also guarantee their safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| And this is a good – if I owned a business and this proposal came to me, it's a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| It's a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| You can replace a 30-year fleet and you've got the money in the bank to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| or you've even had to borrow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| It's a savings over the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| That's just my opinion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| I'd like to add just a couple of things to what Commissioner Andrews just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| You know, if we take all these things and put them down one, two, three, four, five, six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| you've got two other things to consider in there that we've kind of alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| Number one, once these cars get past 100,000 miles, they're worth X amount of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| Once they get past 125,000 miles, he's going to be lucky to get $500 out of a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| I mean, you know, if we put them out for sale, that's about – am I correct, JJ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| Is that pretty close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| Pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| So, in effect, we can save some money there by taking some of these high ones off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| Then you look at the maintenance on it, the 400,000 we can save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| When you add all these things together, it would be great if these were going to be available July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:22| But they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Today is the last day that we've got to look at this proposal and get these at this figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| I'm like Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| I would not – if I was a deputy or a city policeman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| I would not want to be out here running 90, 100 miles an hour chasing somebody in a car with 125,000 miles on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3093)|
| 0:51:41| You know, I'd rather have a bicycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| So, anyway, I think this is a good deal for the county all the way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| It's an investment in our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| I want to apologize to you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| I've been on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| Fountain City is in a flood zone right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| My building is going underwater as we speak, so I may have to leave the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| The question that I've got, and I'm sort of like you, Dr. Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| I'm sort of between a rock and a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| J.J., we're changing these from a Crown Vic to a Crown Vic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| Can we not use anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| Can you not use that police light on top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Can they not interchange out and save some money there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| Well, you can use some of that stuff, but a lot of times if it's on the vehicle that's got over 125,000 miles on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| it's been on that vehicle, it's wore out too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| There are some items that we can change, cages, but the configuration of the vehicles will be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| When you go from a Crown Vic to a Taurus or to a Chevrolet Caprice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| there are different body styles and the back seats that are arranged where the cages go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| and the light bars fit on the roof, those are all different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| So you have to buy specific pieces for specific vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| But what you're wanting to buy, can anything be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| I'm just trying to, you know, we're at 3 million, now we're at 3.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| It's almost like we're looking at LN station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| J.J., can I make one comment that I failed to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| Larry, if it's okay with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| We're going from videotapes at $2 a piece per day to digital that requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| that we already have the infrastructure in place to upload the digital and store it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| So you're also saving money on buying and storing videotapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| I'm just looking at the lights on top of the cruisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| Can you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| The technology has gotten so much better and better for OSHA standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| There's different OSHA standards, there's different traffic control standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| I mean, you'd be more cost in replacing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| I'm sure you probably thought that, J.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| And plus, if we sell those vehicles, the agencies that buy them would rather have them equipped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3219)|
| 0:53:46| already ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| The ones we auction, if they're equipped and ready to go, then they bring more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| I don't want to repeat statements and questions that have already been discussed or covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| I'm very reluctant to take money out of the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| I think it is poor financial policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| I don't know how many times we hear, if we'll spend X, we'll save Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| Usually Y is less than X and probably is in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| But I can support this because conversations I've had with the sheriff and Chief Deputy Trammell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:26| and some others, some other just officers out on the street, that we run the risk of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| what really scares me is encroaching on our response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| I think this government, we do a thousand different things, but the two most important things, I feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| are educating children and protecting people and property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| And if our response time starts increasing, then we're really, nobody's doing their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| I mean, we're not doing our job here and the sheriff's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| I feel that this, if we go to these cars 140,000, 50,000 miles, that that response time might start to drop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3295)|
| 0:55:02| particularly if we were to put two, having to put two officers in one car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| So I think we can support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| I really think we can support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| And you look into the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| I mean, we were, for my first budget, we were short 20 or something last year, 26, 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3315)|
| 0:55:22| This year, gosh, we're already at 100 there or 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| I mean, so we get some cars a few months early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| But I can support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| And a lot of money, but I think it's a good way to spend our reserve funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| I want to just mention something Commissioner Smith has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| A number of our citizens are facing some serious water problems right now because of these heavy rains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| So let's make sure we're remembering all of these folks as they're dealing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| Is there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| I'd like to let Dave speak next, and I'll wrap up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| Sure, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| Thank you, Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Also, Dr. Briggs has also got his light on, if you're wishing to speak last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| One of the things that kind of makes me pause for concern for just a moment would be that this is unrelated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3365)|
| 0:56:15| But later on today, we're going to have a question about a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| And we're probably going to do something different today than we might do in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| but we're going to mark that or punctuate that with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| this is the last time that I expect to ever hear a request like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:36| Sheriff Jones, I'm just not asking a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| I'm just putting this in the context of you said if we don't buy these crown vix today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3399)|
| 0:56:46| and then I've got three or four periods, you know, on up, down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| You know, I'm just using that as a lead in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| The thing that really we should be looking at today, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| also comes from a little bit of organizational knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| Chairman Hammond, Commissioner Norman, and my associate here beside me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:11| Commissioner Smith have been here longer than Dr. Briggs and Commissioner McKenzie and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3431)|
| 0:57:18| But whenever I hear the words that we've dug ourselves into a hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| and that we've lost out for the last two or three years in these monies that we should have received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3444)|
| 0:57:33| I'm distinctly reminded of the former mayor standing before commission saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:41| you will love our budget when it's presented tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| And that was because there was a significant amount of grilling coming from commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3465)|
| 0:57:52| about how we were going to be inside the budget and what was going to be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| So I think our conversation at that time was cut short because of that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| It's a statement like if we don't buy these Crown Vics today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| it's a statement like you will be happy with the budget when it's presented tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| And I don't think I was happy with the budget when it was presented then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| because we didn't buy 30 patrol cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| I thought we were going to get some other present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| I thought we were going to realize the physical responsibility that was facing us as Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3504)|
| 0:58:31| and those cuts might have come from some other location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3511)|
| 0:58:42| Next year's budget, we're just a few months away from next year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| and I'll ask like two or three questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| How does this expenditure right now, if we make this expenditure right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| how does it affect the upcoming budget as will the budget remain the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| or will the budget go up some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| And that's a rhetorical question, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| We don't know what the budget's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| We can say, well, let's pull three million back from next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| but we don't know what the budget's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| So that's just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| And there was another question that was asked a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| and this is brought to mind by Commissioner South's response about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3561)|
| 0:59:29| we can't have a reduced response time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| which I tied to Dr. Briggs' question of how many cars are we talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| I don't want to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| I don't want to ask the question, and I don't need a specific answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| but how many patrolmen are there in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| How many people get out and respond to calls from the citizenry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3588)|
| 0:59:55| Twenty-eight to 30 on every given shift with an overlap of a couple hours on each shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| So sometimes there might be as many as 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| Well, the question is, in total, how many patrolmen are there in Knox County in a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| Twenty-eight to 30 on each shift, five shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| I'm bad at public math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| Do the math for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| I'm asking you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| How many people have patrol cars that are marked that are responding to citizens' requests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| Two hundred and seventy-eight marked vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3625)|
| 1:00:31| How many patrolmen are there that are responding to 911 or customer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| These are customer requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| How many patrolmen are there on the payroll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| Those are 278, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| Two hundred and seventy-eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| So are we talking about 300 cars that we've got in rotation that relates to Dr. Briggs' question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3646)|
| 1:00:53| Two hundred and seventy-eight or 300 or what's the count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| Now, I'm not asking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3656)|
| 1:01:03| No, I guess I am because a couple years ago I was dissatisfied when we didn't recognize our financial responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:12| and we just cut out cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| We cut out cars again last year, and now today we're here with a situation that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| if we don't buy these Crown Vics today, I am disappointed to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3680)|
| 1:01:28| But that doesn't mean you don't get new cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| I just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Now then, I go back to my first sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| Later on today, we're going to discuss TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| Next year, we're going to discuss the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| Please, commissioners will all still be here, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| We need to do better about what it is we promise we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| and then what we end up having to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Thank you, J.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| I like your uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| So does Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| A couple of questions were raised, concerns that I want to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| and then I want to kind of quickly try to wrap this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| The questions about, it seems like the amount we're asking for is going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| Nobody's sure about how many cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| And actually, all this information was provided to every single commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| before our work session last Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| This piece of paper right here was given to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| before last Tuesday's work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| It was put at everybody's place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| Not before the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| It was provided at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| Yeah, at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| Well, before we, I think before the meeting got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| And right here, it has the total cost at $3.47 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| So that's not a surprise today that information was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| I also want to make the point that our fiscal responsibility is part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| of what is looked at when we talk about our bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:12| This is the most fiscally responsible step that we can take at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| in terms of this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| I think we have a lot of questions about what the budget is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| I think that the administration has been very clear about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| cut, cut, cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| It's, I think, very obvious that the sheriff does have a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| to get us back on track in the next four to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| It's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| It's a solid plan if we can stick to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| Unfortunately, we did cut cars the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| And that's what has got us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| I want to mention that over the past two years, we actually saved 2.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| by not buying the cars that we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| So that was a savings we generated over two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| I think JJ's made the point that over 47 percent of our marked patrol cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| have over 100,000 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| At that mileage, we need increased maintenance and major repairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| which jack the cost up for our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| We can take care of that by purchasing these cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| High mileage cars are more likely to malfunction when stressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| and that can be dangerous for our patrol officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| Best practices for law enforcement agencies are to replace marked patrol cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| between 80 and 100,000 miles or 25 percent of the fleet each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| So what we're doing here is trying to get reestablished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| with best practices for our sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| When our used patrol cars go to auction, those over 100,000 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| routinely bring in less than $1,000 apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| When we auction them between 80 and 100,000 miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| the return is significantly higher, up to $3,000 or $4,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| and that helps cover that cost, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| When our patrol cars are not replaced in a timely manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| neither is the added equipment that keeps our officers safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| This is, my feeling, doing a disservice to our patrol officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| And this past year, the number of service calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| made by the Knox County Sheriff's Department increased by 30,000 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| They had 30,000 more calls this past year than normally for service calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| So it is important that we are able to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| a quick response time for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| I think the biggest thing, though, and I like Brad's term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| about a perfect storm, and JJ mentioned this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| the new cars coming out, we can buy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| we can pass up this opportunity, work on our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| and even if we buy 100 new cars on July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| we're not going to receive them here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| until a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| It takes three to six months to roll out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| 100 new patrol vehicles onto the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| So it will be 18 months from today before we would get them all out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| if we waited until July 1st to purchase them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| Also, we're going to be paying about 4,000 more per car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| than we would right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| In the meantime, we're going to be paying increased maintenance costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| on the high mileage cars that we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| and getting less for them when we send them to auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| And I think those are all very important points to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| why this is a good, fiscally sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| fiscally responsible thing to do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| I think it also is worth it to point out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| by making this purchase now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| we take this issue off the budget table for the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| We don't have to worry about finding money for new cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| in next year's budget or the year after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| because we've taken care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| And while, like Brad says, after we can watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| how these other departments react to these new designs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| and make a very good, educated decision the year after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| about which way we want to go with which new car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| And this is a very significant investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| However, it is a one-time expenditure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| and it will benefit our citizens and our law enforcement officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| and it's going to result in tremendous savings for the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| in both the short term and the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| So that is why I brought this forward, why I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| And I'm going to let J.J. make any closing remarks he would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| I just want to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| Commissioner Wright brought up a great point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| that hasn't been talked about yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| If we get these hundred cars this year and zero next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| that's a savings of $1.7 million out of the budget next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| when we would ask for no vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| So next year's budget would be $1.7 million less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| than it would normally be if we asked for vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| So that's a great point, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| I'd like to ask a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| and I want to recognize Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| John Troyer, if I might ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| what is our fund balance right now where we would be taking this money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| General fund, I'm designated as $42 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| finished out last year at $42 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| What are your budget plans to draw from that $3 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| The budget we're in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| So you're saying that would take us down to $39 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| So basically we have $39 million that we're working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| in terms of our rainy day fund, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| The savings that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| is this money that can be put back into the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| like the $1.7 million we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| the $500 to save on auction or $1,000 for police cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| is that money that could be put back into the rainy day fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| Where would that money go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| In other words, if we sell 100 police cars or 50 or 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| whatever it is, does that money go back into the general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| Yes, it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| And so most certainly if purchasing were to conduct a sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:26| and we sell those cars, they can go back into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| Now we talked about $1.7 million next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| and that that would be a savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| Are we saying that the budget is going to be reduced by $1.7 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| Is that going to be a savings that can go back into the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| or is this $1.7 million that we just won't see next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| It's a $1.7 million request that won't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| So we're not talking about a reduction of $1.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| in the budget next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| It would be a $1.7 million request for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| What will this do to our bond rating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| If we're down to 39 and we take another 3.4, that gets us down to 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4201)|
| 1:10:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| I think I don't want to speak for the bond rating agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| but through my conversations with the rating agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| yes, they are very much interested in the amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| but they're also interested in the discipline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| and the fiscal discipline is once you pass a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| do you stick with the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| And there will be conversations about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| But if this is a one-time request that's coming from the Rainy Day Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| it's not actually coming out of the, quote, operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| It's coming out of the Rainy Day Fund, but they still, you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| would look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| Yes, they would look at that and they would look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| especially if it started to become what they would be fearful of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| and bond rating agent, bond raters are a normal fearful bunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| would be concerned that this could become a pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| Thank you, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| Where I'm coming down on this is, I believe, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| I drove a vehicle today to the city county building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| that had 118,000 miles on it, but I don't have to chase people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| and I hopefully don't have to run away from anybody being chased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| And it's a whole different deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| I mean, the vehicle that I have buses a marked police car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| it's just two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| So in looking at the high mileage, I understand, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| where the sheriff's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| I guess I'm coming down on the notion of what is the best for our citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| What is the best for us to see that they are protected properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| And that's become a bit more sensitive to me now that I've moved across the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| and I'm in a more rural area because it, all of a sudden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| becomes a little bit more important to me, response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| How important was it, for example, to have the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| and this was a city, arrive within minutes of the church shooting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| How important was it to have the police arrive within minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| of the Central High School shooting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| I realize those are tragic events and those are things that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| but to me that points out why it is important that our police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| provide the protection that we need on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| So I'm willing to go along with a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| I don't know that I'm at $100,000, but I'm wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| could you make it with $70,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| You said you had, we had $19,000 and you were asking another $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| If we were to go with $70,000, that saves us a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| and I think I could go with $70,000 a lot more than I could go with $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| because that would kind of get you up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| The only thing about that is that we would still need some more next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| if we go with $70,000, and that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| Even though that $1.7 million request wouldn't be on the budget next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| it would certainly be realized in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| If we don't request $1.7 million in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| you're going to see a $1.7 million savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| With $70,000, then we'd still need $30,000 more next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| to make the $100,000 that we need to get back on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| so we can go $45,000 each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| Plus, remember, if we get $30,000 next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| then there are going to be new vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| they're going to be more expensive, and they're going to be untested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| You spoke to a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| I had a slightly different number, but it was the same thing that I was going to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| about how many we can get by with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| You know, part of what we have, it's not a matter of if you can save money or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| It's sort of like what my wife does when she goes to shop on sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| She comes home, and I see a credit card bill of a couple hundred dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| and she tells me how much money I saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| I have to say, I have some questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4422)|
| 1:13:48| And I have to say, I look at it here, it doesn't matter how much money you can save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| If you don't have the money to buy it, you can't, you know, you shouldn't be buying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| The other point that I wanted to make on this is that we can't take these cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4435)|
| 1:14:02| and this part of the budget by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| We have to look at the whole budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| And we may very well be running shortages on the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4446)|
| 1:14:12| And it may be the same type of thing is that it may be an issue of let's buy 100 cars this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| or let's spread it out over a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| Even though it costs a little bit more, we may not have to lay off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| Last year, I think it was either $1.2 or $1.6 million shortage was going to cause us to lay off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:28| 26 school teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| If we have a $3 million shortage, does that mean we lay off 50 school teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| And I don't know the answer to that question because I don't know what the budget is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| But it's the same thing that Commissioner Hammond spoke of is that it may be a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| And the one that I came up with was 60 new cars right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| That would cover roughly the 20 cars we got shorted next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| plus would partially make up for, you know, for next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| And the question I was going to ask is, do we have a motion on the floor now for 100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| We have a motion for 100 at $3.4 million approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| It's a little more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| But whatever those figures were, it's up to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| And, you know, we can vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| And I don't know what the right number is, but I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| I was going to pick, I was going to take a number of 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| Commissioner Hammond picked 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| I'd like to make a substitute motion to purchase right now 65 cars and then have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4520)|
| 1:15:28| now you understand that it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| we're still going to need the cars and both the mayor and the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| The one thing that makes me think this may be a good motion is because no one's going to be happy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| And sometimes that's a good sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| But that's something that allows our patrol office just to get rid of the 65 worst cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4540)|
| 1:15:46| I'm very concerned about this delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| And I really, I don't know how long it's going to take to get those cars into production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| But it's not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| It's not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| But I have just as much a problem buying the old model car as I do buying the new model car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| because the new model a lot of times is a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| But we've got to stay within our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| We don't know what's going to happen to the school teachers this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| We may have to dip into the rainy day fund for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| But I do know that we can't be letting these cars go, you know, ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| They just won't hold up under the type of beating that they take being a patrol car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| So I'd like to make a substitute motion of 65 vehicles now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| I understand we'll have to buy some more next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| But it will partially take care of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| And we can probably get these vehicles delivered immediately and get them out on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| There is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| And I want to be clearly understood that it's not the issue of cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| It's the issue of how we're going about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| So your motion would be 65 cars at $34,378.49 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4612)|
| 1:16:58| So whatever that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| I'm not good at public math either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| I think it's about 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| I looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| Yeah, it's about roughly 2.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| But basically 65 cars at that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| And I just want to say again, I don't like this, but I don't know what else to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| It is an unusual circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| I don't like coming in the middle of a budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| It may mean laying off teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| And that's a Hobson's choice that we may have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| And I want to also make the request that this is bringing into whatever the reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4647)|
| 1:17:36| I believe we were saying the reduction would be $1.7 million in next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| Whatever this prorates down to on vehicle requests next year, this is a reduction in that budget also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4661)|
| 1:17:49| Mr. Smith, do you have something you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| J.J. wanted to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Go ahead, J.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| We would need 35 more vehicles next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| So take whatever 1.7 minus whatever 35 vehicles would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| It would be agreeable with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| For the mayor, I guess, or John, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| They talked about that we wouldn't get these until how many months, 12, 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| When do we pay for these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| We would get these right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| Is that what I understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| I think we have to get the order in today, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| Yeah, there's some sitting on the ground somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4700)|
| 1:18:27| Commissioner Perales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| I do want to respond to some of the concerns and questions that have been brought up since the last time I spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:39| Mr. Troyer spoke about that the people who do these bond ratings are concerned about a pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4719)|
| 1:18:47| A one-time expenditure is not a pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| This is not something that's going to be coming up again next year or the year after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| This is a one-time thing, and Knox County does not go mid-budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| This is, in my opinion or my understanding, this is the first time we've ever done something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| And I don't think we can be afraid to take an opportunity that's going to benefit our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4749)|
| 1:19:16| and our patrol officers as much as this will and generate this kind of savings that it's going to generate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| just because we're afraid that the bond people might consider this a pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| No one is going to consider a one-time expenditure a pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| Also, it's not just that the money recouped from auction of these vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| It's not that it can go into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| It does go into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| That's what happens now when these vehicles are auctioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| The money doesn't go into the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| The money goes back into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| The idea that we can get by with less than 100 is what landed us in this position today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4796)|
| 1:20:04| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| We thought we could get by with less than 45 last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| or we could get by with less than 45 or 50 the two years prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| And that's what landed us where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| I don't want to make the same mistake again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| Also, I'm just going to mention this because it was brought up already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| I was at the church shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| My family was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| And I have never been so grateful to see law enforcement officers in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| And I do not want anyone else to be shorted a quick response time because we're afraid to take a risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:42| a very calculated and, in my opinion, a risk with a large payoff for our taxpayers and our uniformed officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4842)|
| 1:20:53| This argument about the school budget and laying off teachers, we don't make that call, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4853)|
| 1:21:01| The school board decides what the school budget is and if teachers will be laid off or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| And I'm not going to hold our patrol officers hostage because we're afraid that teachers might get laid off in a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4866)|
| 1:21:17| I don't think that's a valid argument for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| I will be voting down the substitute motion and returning to we need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4881)|
| 1:21:28| This is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| And we need to buy these 100 cars for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| It's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| Real quick, I just did some math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| If we bought 65 and then bought 35 more, we're still looking at $3.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| We're just separating the two payments between two budget years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| And so it really, you're saving zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| Also, and we will be paying, if we buy 35 cars next year, to reiterate what Sheriff Jones said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4910)|
| 1:21:57| we'll be paying $4,000 more per car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| And they will be an untested car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| I don't have a problem buying a car in its last year of production, especially something like the Crown Vic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| I have a huge problem buying a car in its first year of production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| So I don't think delaying the purchase of 35 cars until next year is going to reap any financial benefit whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:22| And it actually may end up causing more problems because we will have increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| we will still have those increased maintenance costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| Subject to a motion on the floor is to purchase 65 vehicles at a cost of $34,378.49 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| Roll call, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| Mr. Chairman, what was that math?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| Brad, what was that math again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| Give us that math you used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| If we purchased, you would ask me to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| If we purchased, we got 2.2 for 65, right, Jeff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| Is that what you figured out, 2.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| And then if you go with, you add $4,000, which is the approximate Ford's increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| and you brought the other 35, it would be $1.33 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| And so you can buy them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| He's still going to ask for $1.3 million if we only buy 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| That's basically what it is because they buy his 35 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=4990)|

| 1:23:28| Commissioner Anders votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| Commissioner Smith votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| Commissioner Wright votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5015)|

| 1:23:38| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| Commissioner Hammond votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| Commissioner Shouse votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| Commissioner Shouse votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5024)|
| 1:23:55| Vote is seven in favor, four against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| We've got to go back to where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| And that is to talk about your motion, which is to delay for 60 days the Hillside vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| I want a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| If I think I heard the law director right, and please correct me, that we cannot delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5054)|
| 1:24:21| today's agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| So I guess my question is, we cannot delay the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| There's nothing else to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| He said we couldn't pass yes or no early, but we could delay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| He said we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| Well, no, I thought he also said that we could not take that agenda item off of today's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| You can table or defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| What you can't do is take any kind of affirmative vote that's going to deprive people of a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| right or due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| If you're merely continuing it, those rights continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| It's if you decided you were going to vote now when people presumed they were going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| be able to come at 6 to talk on the issue, that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| But if you feel it's for extenuating circumstance, it needs to be tabled for further research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| or in clemency of whether you can table it or continue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| And then my second point of clarification, can we do that in commission when there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| zonings that we're discussing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| So the law director has opined that you have a proper motion and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| I just wanted to ask the maker of the motion, I guess Mr. Brown, you did not mention MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| Is there an MPC component involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| I didn't give the total number and scope of who would be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| But I see it would be commission, city council, MPC, developers, anybody who has expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5141)|
| 1:25:48| in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| And the meeting is going to be sunshine and open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| But, you know, this needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| I just felt, you know, we heard all the debate for three hours the other night and somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| had a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| He said, I hope there's professionals involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| And, of course, the MPC is professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| Whether many people agree with their opinion or not, they're professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| I just wanted them to have some involvement in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| And would it be the same task force or is that for someone else to decide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| What, 23 people, a couple of guys resigned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| I don't think it needs to go back to the same task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| I think that this needs to be a committee possibly put together by commission chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5183)|
| 1:26:30| and council chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| And I've heard the 15% number is the big stumbling block I've heard from most people on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| at church, at Kroger and everywhere, the 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| So that's, I hope we can define that and embellish that somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| This is for benefit of my staff at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| Still getting lots of calls on this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| But that's not what I'm asking right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| I'm asking, although his light is on, Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| I need to know how you feel about this as we continue this discussion for the next few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5227)|
| 1:27:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| Mr. Chairman, I'm fine with the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| Now, I think the postponement, there's some allusion possibly to something being like a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5239)|
| 1:27:28| or a mediation or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| No, I'm not about that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| We are very confident in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| We want to, at best, have time to express more about the details of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5257)|
| 1:27:48| With this monumental misinformation campaign that's taking place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5268)|
| 1:27:55| it's probably to our benefit to postpone and confront that misinformation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5275)|
| 1:28:02| and have plenty of time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| And so this will be the postponement, will be about additional workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:12| additional time for both sides to present their issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5292)|
| 1:28:18| I really don't think it's beneficial what we did the other night in terms of public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5298)|
| 1:28:27| But as long as the opponents have a presentation and they stick with the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| they stick with the discussion of what the plan actually is, we're fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| We've spent three years on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| We'll keep going, keep trying to get this across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| We're very confident in the credibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| and the ultimate benefit of this plan for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5334)|
| 1:29:00| I want to support Tony's position on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:06| This task force has worked on this for three years, as he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| I've been to some of the task force meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| not the presentations they did out in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| but the actual meetings where the work was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| I know how hard they've worked on this, how much time they've put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| I agree with Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| There is no need for any other committee to come in and muck around with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| It's a solid, good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| All the screaming about the 15 percent slope issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| there's already policy in place that deals with 15 percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| And actually what this plan does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| it actually goes in and refines those regulations for 15 percent slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| or that policy, excuse me, for 15 percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| Point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| I didn't open this up for a discussion on this item in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| I opened it up for a discussion and a vote on a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| I'm sorry, but Commissioner Brown, I believe you said as part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| you wanted to put this committee together to take another look at the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| Is that not part of your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| Yes, it is, but that doesn't mean discussing it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| You gave me three hours Tuesday night and got nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| Well, what I'm discussing has to do with whether or not it's prudent to throw this to another committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5418)|
| 1:30:25| I don't think that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| But you're going on and talking about all of the details and the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| and that's not part of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| Well, what I'm addressing is why I don't think it needs to go back to a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| but I think that people do need to look at the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| Well, it's because there is misinformation, particularly about this 15 percent slope issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| I'm going to give Commissioner Burroughs a little leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| Are you finished or do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| Well, my point that I was making, and I was almost done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| just need a couple more sentences, is that the 15 percent slope policy is already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| What this does is refine it using more current technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| It doesn't dramatically change the 15 percent policy that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| What it does is it refines it and makes it more accurate and more fairly applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| I'm not really going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| I don't want to chime in on the motion or the debate that's going on right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| But there may be people that come down here this evening that pay their $8 to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| And I've had this happen to me when I've come down to city council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| is that the place will be packed and then they'll decide to defer something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| and then all these people that came down here didn't have an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| What I might suggest is that this evening, and by the way, I agree a lot with what you say, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| Well, that was my reason for trying to put it on at 2 o'clock so that we could get the notification out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| to these people where they wouldn't come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| Well, my problem is I don't know who's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| I don't know who to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| And, I mean, I doubt if they're going to be checking the news when they get off at, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| hardly going to have to leave at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| I mean, all I don't want to do is have a bunch of people show up down here that want to have a say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| and we just tell them to pay their parking ticket and go home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| is that we don't have to vote on it tonight if that's what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| I really want to defer to Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| But if they do come down here expecting to want to tell us something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| I want to give them the opportunity to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| You know, we can ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| We don't have to vote on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| I really agree with what you're saying about we need to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| if we want to get this out just as an informational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| and I think that's what Tony said also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| to get it out as an informational issue more to the public since it now has everyone's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| But I would like, if people come down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| to give them the opportunity to have their say about this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| We also may want to limit the discussion on it because it could go on all night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| but maybe talk about it an hour, let everyone down here be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| let them know that we will have an opportunity again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| But I just think it's wrong for citizens to come down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| they fill the place up, and we just tell them to go home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| that we're not going to listen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| I think, yeah, I think that's a good idea that Dr. Briggs has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| I'd be disappointed too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| And there's just no way to reach everybody probably in this short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| and certainly some will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| And I don't know how this, I suppose the session then would be just a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5594)|
| 1:33:27| I mean, we could still go ahead with our presentation that we had planned, MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| and we could still have people come to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| I mean, the ones that show up, I mean, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| And since they're here and they're prepared and we're prepared, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| But then we're going to make the decision not to vote tonight, and that's fine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5630)|
| 1:34:00| I mean, I'll acknowledge the motion to defer the vote, postpone the vote for two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:08| You want to wait until tonight to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| You want to wait until tonight to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5651)|
| 1:34:12| No, we can do it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| Yeah, we can do it right now and then save some people the opportunity of coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5654)|
| 1:34:19| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| So that's reasonable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| I believe that if we're going to postpone for 60 days, part of your motion was to have this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5664)|
| 1:34:34| We should have some kind of plan before we leave here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| Are we going to have additional sessions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| How are they going to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| In other words, if we could have this discussion later, if we're going to postpone, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| But I think we should maybe have a discussion of what kind of framework are we looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| Are we looking at four more hearings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| We're looking at a 60-day delay was his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| So I guess I would be looking to you to be thinking about that, not necessarily to comment now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| I would like to say a couple of things in those regards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| I could see the benefit of having a joint workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| Again, city council, county commission workshop, having the same people come, MPC staffers are on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:20| I mean, they're guiding this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| And so MPC is kind of out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| You know, they've already approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| Some of them are trying to chime back in that we're on the side that lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| But I see the whatever we do next just being another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5733)|
| 1:35:43| And it truly being a workshop rather than somewhat of the grouch session, which it deteriorated into the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:53| And that's not to say that we can't have, I just want more structure, more structure in terms of, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5753)|
| 1:36:01| if we're going to have a public hearing, this is what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| This is how many people, if we're going to have everybody speak that wants to speak, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| But this is the public hearing session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| This is the public hearing part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| But we're going to have an informational session also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| And so workshop's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| I'm not for like bring this back to a committee and some committees make decisions or tell us which way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:29| Let's just stay with this workshop session and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| Let me just ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| Do you feel that you all would be amenable to any type of compromise on any points in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| Or is the position basically this is the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| You know, a lot of times, as Mr. Shouse mentioned there, there's the issue of 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5805)|
| 1:36:52| And Amy mentioned 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| We consider that a non-issue because of what we have employed heretofore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5814)|
| 1:37:01| We have a model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| The model is based on historical data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| We think it's solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| We want to keep presenting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| We think this is good policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| We understand this is three years of study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| This is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| You know, this is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| What this is, this is bad government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| This is an example of bad government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| A task force comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| You tell them to go do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| They spend three years doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| And they come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| And then a group of people can spend one month and shoot it to pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| I mean, that's just horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| It's just horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5859)|
| 1:37:40| But now that's beside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| You know, I'm getting going here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| Now I'm going to settle back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| Now, so if we would just keep going with this workshop process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5866)|
| 1:37:55| I think we can work through it and we'll cut through some of the smoke that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| Mr. Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| What exactly is the motion on the floor right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| The motion is to delay for 60 days with a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| And create the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| There's nothing yet that designates the committee makeup or who's on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we simply delay for 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| that we try to schedule a joint workshop, informational session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| not a public hearing with the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| And then if necessary, if we feel it's necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| to set another workshop for just county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| Can I ask you to clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| You're saying workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| Is that no public participation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| If the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| But you said that you said the words of command and respectfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| because I want to get this right when I'm voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| Commissioner Norman said that the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| the public hearing we had, your correct words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| was not beneficial and it was unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| You want to have workshop with no public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| You said it would turn into a gripe session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| There is parts of that that just turned into something that was totally nonproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| Well, if the public has an opinion, it needs to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| And we can hear them in a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| I'm not advocating that we can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| that we eliminate a public hearing from some part of the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:23| I'm not advocating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| That was my impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| I will just say that, yes, I welcome public participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| I think that, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| what happened Tuesday night was that the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| for lack of not wanting to drag this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| the commissioners themselves did not really have an opportunity to ask many questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| It was a lot of people getting up and speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| And quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| several of those people did not stick to the issue of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| but made personal remarks against the people who worked on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=5993)|
| 1:40:00| And I felt like that was inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| I would not be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| I would ask that anyone from the public who does participate can find their comments to the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:12| and not to the people who worked on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| So that's my substitute motion, that we delay for 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| we try to create a joint workshop with city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| and then, if necessary, we have one more workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| Is there a second to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| Can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| I can't second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| Can I second that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| I second the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| And this might be turned into a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| what did Lambert always call it, a friendly amendment or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| And so, Mr. Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| would you be in favor of adopting this and modifying your motion to Ms. Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6057)|
| 1:41:05| If you would, then I'll remove, you know, I'll endorse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| Does that include a joint commission, council, MPC workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| I think that's what I said, although I didn't include MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| But MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| A lot of stuff has been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:23| I said a joint city council, county commission workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| MPC has already dealt with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| They vetted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| They voted on it already with only two voting against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| So this isn't before MPC anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| It's now before us in council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| But we have professionals on the MPC who can answer all the questions that will be brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| Well, we have those same professionals on this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| Mr. Chairman, I mean, I would be fine with MPC coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| They were invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| We had a joint MPC city council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| And city council couldn't get a word in edgewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| That's my problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| There's a certain person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6134)|
| 1:42:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| There's a certain person that is absolutely committed to defeating this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6142)|
| 1:42:29| And he came before us at our workshop, even though I thought that's rather strange and maybe, well, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6149)|
| 1:42:41| So there is some concern about saying I'd like to have it just city council, county commission workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6161)|
| 1:42:49| We're the two bodies that are left for the approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| They've already done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| The staff's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| I don't understand why we need them to invite the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| But, Mr. Brown, I would appreciate your comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| The only thing I want to be sure is that we've got somebody there at that workshop that can answer the questions of us 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:14| and that nine that are sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| I think what we're seeing is we're seeing just how emotional this issue has become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| Perhaps a 60-day delay might be good, or perhaps it would be good to just vote it up or down today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| But I want to get everybody's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| We already have people here in the audience for and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| And we're at 3.30, and we probably need to take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| And this is on public notice for weeks and days of occurring at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6223)|
| 1:43:50| Maybe we need to look at some of our other business and take this up again at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6230)|
| 1:43:56| Well, we have a substitute motion on the floor in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| So unless you all want to withdraw, we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| Withdraw your motion, and let's put all this off until 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| Roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| I don't hear anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| We need to get the last two lights and then we'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| You know, and I will say, you know, today we got over 60 emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| I think, you know, guys, whether you're going to vote up or down today is your material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| But we've got to, I'm anticipating a lot of people going to be here at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| A lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| I've gotten four phone calls sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| So, and I think it's a disservice to the public if we postpone it to Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| But we need to do what we said when we were going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| And let's get on to the other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6282)|

| 1:54:48| it's creating quite a situation out in our community. We just noticed on Facebook that Holston Middle School students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=6888)|

| 2:08:14| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7694)|
| 2:08:15| The developer of the Wal-Mart and TIF has been gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| So how did the commission at the time vote on the IDB proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7699)|
| 2:08:30| On that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| Well, how did the IDB, I'm sorry, how did the IDB vote on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| Did you all vote to bring that one forward to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| Now, are you getting confused with the Lowe's project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| The Hall's project that came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| It was a project in Hall's off of Maynardville Highway that came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7726)|
| 2:08:51| That was a Lowe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| Okay, that Lowe's project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7733)|
| 2:08:54| Also, there was an application on a Wal-Mart as well, but I don't think that was actually heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7734)|
| 2:08:59| So how did the Lowe's project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7739)|
| 2:09:02| So what happened with that one was the IDB application review committee voted not to recommend approval of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7742)|
| 2:09:09| to the full board, and it never came to the full board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| It was withdrawn by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7755)|
| 2:09:16| So, you know, I talked a lot about my concerns with it in that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7756)|
| 2:09:24| and several people approached me and tried to convince me how great of a project it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7764)|
| 2:09:29| And it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| It's a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7770)|
| 2:09:31| I just don't think it meets the standard of what a TIF is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7771)|
| 2:09:37| And I ask you all to strongly consider not perpetuating a sin of the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7777)|
| 2:09:44| And that's what it was for this project X number of years ago to be passed then was a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7784)|
| 2:09:53| And as Commissioner Wright I think alluded to, I don't want to put words in his mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| is we're on the verge of passing through a sin of the past, correcting something that we won't do again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7797)|
| 2:10:06| And I asked for a statement about what the law says about when to give a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7806)|
| 2:10:14| And the statement in that says that they may acquire property for redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7814)|
| 2:10:22| if they are blighted areas in order to remove, prevent, or reduce blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7822)|
| 2:10:32| The main factors are the causes of blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7832)|
| 2:10:37| And then if you continue to pull that string and talk about, well, what is blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7837)|
| 2:10:46| it's deterioration, dilapidation, decay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7846)|
| 2:10:50| And then if you really want to get into it, you get to talking about urban decay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7850)|
| 2:10:55| which is, again, linked in with this term blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7855)|
| 2:11:00| And if you continue to talk about what is urban decay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| it's a part of a city that falls into disrepair, decrepitude, abandoned buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7864)|
| 2:11:12| fragmented families, political disenfranchisement, desolate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7872)|
| 2:11:19| These are the terms that are associated with blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| And blight is what the requirement of a TIF is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7883)|
| 2:11:29| There's no dancing around that by saying this is a great project and we need the traffic taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7889)|
| 2:11:37| Better flowing traffic in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| Don't disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| This area is going to boom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7903)|
| 2:11:44| I think everyone knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| It's going to get even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| My point exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7907)|
| 2:11:50| It's going to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7910)|
| 2:11:52| If it's not the most affluent area in Knox County, it's in the top three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7912)|
| 2:11:59| You can't call a three-year-old really nice facility blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7919)|
| 2:12:05| The guy got in for whatever reason, got over his head or his company got in, got over his head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7925)|
| 2:12:10| probably made some bad decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| The per capita income in that area is still good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7935)|
| 2:12:20| The number of parks in that area is still extremely high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| The number of greenways in that sector still probably outshines a lot of our other sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7943)|
| 2:12:33| So, you know, let's, as we go through this process, as we become more accountable to our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7953)|
| 2:12:43| let's not continue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7963)|
| 2:12:46| This is where we say this was a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7966)|
| 2:12:49| X number of years ago, it's a mistake today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| Blight and being associated with that area of southwest Knox County is a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7973)|
| 2:12:59| I guess southwest Knoxville with the finger annexation is a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7979)|
| 2:13:06| So I ask you all to strongly consider the facts of when these things should apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7986)|
| 2:13:15| TIFs should apply, when TIFs should not apply, and consider that in your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=7995)|
| 2:13:21| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8001)|
| 2:13:26| I guess, first of all, I'd like for somebody to respond to what Mr. McKenzie just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8006)|
| 2:13:32| Bud, would you respond to some of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| Commissioner's Bud Cullum, 6312 Kingston Pike, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8015)|
| 2:13:42| Commissioner McKenzie, to all the commission, I think the first thing we need to realize is we got involved in this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8022)|
| 2:13:50| and the TIF had been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| I think that I would definitely agree that this area as a whole does have a very high per capita income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8032)|
| 2:14:01| It historically has experienced a very high growth rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8041)|
| 2:14:06| I think it is also important to say, though, that from the term of blighted as it relates to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8046)|
| 2:14:13| I think some of the definitions you used for blight would qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8053)|
| 2:14:19| This property would qualify for some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| It has sat for the better part of six years in a state where the residents who did purchase dwelling units as a part of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8061)|
| 2:14:34| have not achieved what they thought that they were going to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8074)|
| 2:14:39| The property, the way we even ended up acquiring it was by purchasing a note that was in default at a discount from the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8079)|
| 2:14:50| What we are showing to use this TIF for that was originally approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8090)|
| 2:14:54| we are actually doing more road work than what was in the original approval of this TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8094)|
| 2:15:02| This is road work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8102)|
| 2:15:03| You have a failing intersection and you have a state government, a city government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8103)|
| 2:15:08| and a county government that doesn't currently have the funds to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| We think that this is a classic situation of a TIF being able to ride the shoulders of private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8113)|
| 2:15:20| and get needed infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8120)|
| 2:15:23| These are infrastructure improvements that I believe that the TDOT and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8123)|
| 2:15:28| and the traffic impact analysis would say are warranted if we never asked to build another square foot of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8128)|
| 2:15:36| They're warranted right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| And the money is not there to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8138)|
| 2:15:40| So I say if you look no further than that one issue right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8140)|
| 2:15:45| then this is a situation that's a win-win for the city, county, and the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8145)|
| 2:15:53| I think when you add the fact that the school is locating there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8153)|
| 2:15:57| that just even brings it more into focus on how much those road improvements are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8157)|
| 2:16:05| So I think it's a win-win if that's all you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8165)|
| 2:16:09| But then when you do add in the amount of jobs that we're bringing in a depressed economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8169)|
| 2:16:15| not only construction jobs but just in the first phase of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8175)|
| 2:16:20| we probably have 500 permanent jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| So I think when you look at it under that light and you look at it under the light of this was something that was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8182)|
| 2:16:28| prior to us getting involved in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| and, in fact, was a material consideration of our becoming involved in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8190)|
| 2:16:35| is we knew that there was a TIF associated that allowed that road work to be done at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8195)|
| 2:16:43| Bud, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8203)|
| 2:16:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8204)|
| 2:16:45| And I guess I would like some description of the road improvements on Pellissippi again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8205)|
| 2:16:53| Would you give us a little detail about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8213)|
| 2:16:58| especially as regards the phased aspects of those road improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8218)|
| 2:17:07| Commissioner, I will very briefly verbally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| and then I may turn it over to our traffic engineer to give more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8230)|
| 2:17:14| But essentially it involves building the slip ramp off of Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8234)|
| 2:17:20| In order to do that, you have to then build roads that not only connect to the existing Thunderhead Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8240)|
| 2:17:25| which is the road that the school property fronts on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8245)|
| 2:17:28| but then also another road that connects into North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8248)|
| 2:17:33| In addition to that, there are improvements to be made at the existing exit ramp off of Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8253)|
| 2:17:40| There are improvements to be made both in signalization and in widening at North Shore itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8260)|
| 2:17:47| That was all in the original plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| What we have added to the plan is we are actually going to widen North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8269)|
| 2:17:55| that goes between the two lakes that are controlled by TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8275)|
| 2:18:00| That is part of what we would be using the funds from the TIF for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| And finally, there are improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8284)|
| 2:18:06| Now, this is on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8286)|
| 2:18:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8289)|
| 2:18:10| You're talking about everything you're talking about is on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| That would be in phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| What is shown on this plan, this plan actually shows the final thing I just told you to be in phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8294)|
| 2:18:21| But based on where we stand with our couple issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| where we stand with our main anchor tenant on what they want to be to happen in phase one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8305)|
| 2:18:30| and because of the fact that for us to use the shot rock that we will be creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8310)|
| 2:18:37| as a part of our grading and filling operation, we really need to do that in phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8317)|
| 2:18:43| So even though this plan that you see in front of the podium right now will have that in yellow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8323)|
| 2:18:48| which would be phase two instead of green, we envision that to be in phase one also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8328)|
| 2:18:53| Now, the additional phase two work is on the other side of Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8333)|
| 2:19:00| on the opposite side with some areas on some exit ramps and entrance ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8340)|
| 2:19:06| Beyond that verbal description, I would like to turn it over to Jeff Mize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8346)|
| 2:19:13| He could probably answer some more specific questions if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8353)|
| 2:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| No, that's satisfactory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| I'm really just wanting that detail that you provided about phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8362)|
| 2:19:23| Then I just have one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8363)|
| 2:19:26| In terms of the total county obligation from the TIF, I mean, the TIF is a $9 million TIF, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8366)|
| 2:19:33| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8373)|
| 2:19:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8374)|
| 2:19:35| The city is obligated for $3 million, and the county is obligated for $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8375)|
| 2:19:40| And that, is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| That is true, and that was the way it was before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8382)|
| 2:19:47| However, our attorney who was involved, I believe at the time, Mark Mamentoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8387)|
| 2:19:52| certainly has been involved with the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8392)|
| 2:19:57| may be able to explain why that came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8397)|
| 2:20:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8401)|
| 2:20:02| I'd appreciate that, I guess, if Mark would be able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| or give us some history about how that took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8406)|
| 2:20:11| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8411)|
| 2:20:12| My name is Mark Mamentoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8412)|
| 2:20:16| Commissioner, before I go there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8416)|
| 2:20:17| I was going to try to answer Commissioner McKenzie's points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| This TIF, there's two types of tax increment financing in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8419)|
| 2:20:23| There's tax increment financing through housing authorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8423)|
| 2:20:26| also known as redevelopment authorities, do a lot of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| That's Title 13, Chapter 20 of the Tennessee Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8428)|
| 2:20:31| That requires a finding of blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| This particular tax increment financing is originally approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| through the Industrial Development Board under Title 7, Section 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| There is no requirement of blight whatsoever under this particular chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8440)|
| 2:20:44| in order to do tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| This is purely an economic development TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| It's a decision on behalf of county commission to decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| is this good economic development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| And I'm not trying to argue that point right now or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| But there is no ñ blight is not a factor in this particular type of TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| That's only on a Title 13, Chapter 20 TIF that blight is a factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8460)|
| 2:21:05| Now, you could argue that we should only do TIFs for blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| but state law allows you to do them for both non-blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8467)|
| 2:21:11| and generally to support economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| and greenfield development where there's not blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| There's not been any finding of blight in this particular instance by the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| or at any point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8479)|
| 2:21:23| I don't know if that helps answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| I don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8485)|
| 2:21:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| He has the floor, so I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8489)|
| 2:21:30| And then, Tony, to answer, Commissioner Norman, to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| is that the history of the six million versus three million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8492)|
| 2:21:35| I honestly was not involved, but I obviously watched it carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8495)|
| 2:21:38| because I've been involved in many of the tax increment financings in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8498)|
| 2:21:41| I think the thought was because a larger percentage of the sales tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8501)|
| 2:21:46| goes to the school system instead of to ñ by agreement with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| that they set the figure larger for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8510)|
| 2:21:53| and the county's budget was larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| I honestly don't know the thinking at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| It was an agreement reached between Mayor Agsdell and Mayor Haslam at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| in terms of their comfort levels of where they were comfortable supporting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8520)|
| 2:22:05| and that was what's in the original tax increment economic impact plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8525)|
| 2:22:09| that was approved several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8531)|
| 2:22:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8532)|
| 2:22:13| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8534)|
| 2:22:15| I think I wanted to touch on what Commissioner McKenzie was speaking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8535)|
| 2:22:21| You know, this is a road we're going to have to improve when we build a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8541)|
| 2:22:25| and correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8545)|
| 2:22:30| If they build this, and let's say we TIF this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8550)|
| 2:22:36| You know, they build these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| They're on the hook for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8558)|
| 2:22:39| The county's not on the hook for it, and we own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| We're going to have to make it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| We're bonding this virtually over 16 years, hopefully to pay off earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8563)|
| 2:22:47| based on our discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8567)|
| 2:22:48| Is that right, Bud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| The TIF goes back to ñ go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| I would like to correct you that you're not bonding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8577)|
| 2:22:58| We're bonding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8578)|
| 2:22:59| We're not on the hook for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8579)|
| 2:23:00| We're getting the road, and we're losing future tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8580)|
| 2:23:05| but we're also building a road we're going to have to build with bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| if we don't let them build it, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8588)|
| 2:23:11| And so, you know, the road improvements are going to have to be made for buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8591)|
| 2:23:16| near the lake or near the entrance where the school is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8596)|
| 2:23:20| Pellissippi is at failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| We're allowing a developer at their cost and the banks taking the loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8603)|
| 2:23:29| and, you know, we're losing some future tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| but we're going to lose it anyway because we're going to have to do it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| So, you know, I think TIFs, we ought to be careful with TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| but I think this is a good let the developer pay for our road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| and let the bank get their money back through future tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8623)|
| 2:23:48| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8631)|
| 2:23:53| I believe I spoke to a lot of the things that I was concerned on this particular project before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8633)|
| 2:23:58| and it is being we're re-talking about it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8638)|
| 2:24:07| The Walmart and halls, the developer didn't even think of a TIF on his particular piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8647)|
| 2:24:16| until another developer, I guess, further up Manorville Highway asked for a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8656)|
| 2:24:21| and then this TIF was floating around also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| As an afterthought, they may have written a couple of paragraphs looking for one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| but it was never presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| So TIFs in green space are really going to have to have a lot of payback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8669)|
| 2:24:39| for, I think, this seated commission to even look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8679)|
| 2:24:44| The reason I'm speaking really is because I want to tie together the two things that I've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8684)|
| 2:24:49| This will be two things tied together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:54| When we were talking about purchasing cars a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8694)|
| 2:24:58| we were talking about something in the middle of a budget cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8698)|
| 2:25:02| and we were talking about things that we were going to be happy with years ago, a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8702)|
| 2:25:08| and we're not happy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| This is another thing, as Commissioner McKenzie pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8711)|
| 2:25:16| Maybe this was a sin of the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8716)|
| 2:25:19| It wouldn't be proposed, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8719)|
| 2:25:25| and I know it would not be approved if we were looking at something that was presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8725)|
| 2:25:32| in the circumstance it was presented in the three or four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8732)|
| 2:25:37| The thing that I see important today is the fact that it is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8737)|
| 2:25:42| This is a new and completely different developer, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8742)|
| 2:25:48| The developer before did not make a lot of money on this TIF selling it to the current developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8748)|
| 2:25:56| The previous developer, I think, left his shirt down there somewhere on all of these rocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8756)|
| 2:26:04| Oh, and Commissioner Brown is saying his pants too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| And we have someone that is moving in, trying to pick up the pieces and develop, move this thing along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8769)|
| 2:26:17| With Knox County, the city of Knox, we're receiving more than was in the original deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8777)|
| 2:26:22| but I believe they're staying with the same schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| In other words, TIF is not being extended, picking up the TIF under the original terms and original deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8785)|
| 2:26:33| But to me, the biggest thing that has changed since this came in the four years or so ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8793)|
| 2:26:40| and today is the fact that we, Knox County, we're going to have a school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8800)|
| 2:26:47| And I made my complaint, I voiced my complaint in the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8807)|
| 2:26:53| I don't think the road through there is going to work for school buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8813)|
| 2:27:00| and the transportation needs that are going to be generated by a school being in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8820)|
| 2:27:06| And I am comfortable with the response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8826)|
| 2:27:11| They will work with Doug Dillingham and the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8831)|
| 2:27:15| and their constraints of building and dollars and all that sort of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8835)|
| 2:27:23| to give us a better product than may have been there if there had been no school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8843)|
| 2:27:28| Maybe I'd be on the fence if there's no school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| But the school drags me into it saying that, well, this is probably the best we can be at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8851)|
| 2:27:42| The thing that I need people to hear is that TIFs generally on green space are not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8862)|
| 2:27:50| And bringing things in the middle of the budget cycle in the future is probably not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8870)|
| 2:27:55| At least that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8877)|
| 2:27:58| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8878)|
| 2:28:00| I just don't want to take up a lot more time on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8880)|
| 2:28:03| but I can tell you about 99 percent of my feelings are the same as Sam McKenzie's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8883)|
| 2:28:09| The only thing that I differ on this, and likewise with Dave Wright's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8889)|
| 2:28:15| where I differ on this just a little bit is there was a TIF promised three or four years ago on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8895)|
| 2:28:23| The developer that bought the rights to continue the development understood that the TIF was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8903)|
| 2:28:31| You know, I don't think it's right to go out and shoot somebody's horse out from under them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| when they've got a development going to, quote, correct a wrong that was done at some time in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8916)|
| 2:28:42| I do want to reiterate what Commissioner Wright said about don't take the approval of this TIF as a blanket endorsement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8922)|
| 2:28:53| Future TIFs in non-blighted areas, and this is where I agree with Sam a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8933)|
| 2:28:59| just because we approve this one doesn't mean that we're going to approve TIFs in non-blighted areas in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8939)|
| 2:29:06| But I do think it's essential for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8946)|
| 2:29:09| One, a TIF was promised in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| and I don't think it's right for government to go back on its word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| and undermine a developer that's trying to complete a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8955)|
| 2:29:20| Number two, we're going to have a school there regardless of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8960)|
| 2:29:26| And number three, I think it's in the taxpayer's interest to get as much of this paid for by the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8966)|
| 2:29:32| which ultimately is paid for by the developer as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8972)|
| 2:29:36| And for that reason, I think we need to support the TIF on this particular development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8976)|
| 2:29:41| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8981)|
| 2:29:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| Well, as our mayor says from his 16 years in state legislature, I think I've heard that a few times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8987)|
| 2:29:57| that it's pretty easy to read the room, so let me be the first to congratulate you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=8997)|
| 2:30:08| Law director, correct me if I'm wrong, but a TIF cannot be transferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9008)|
| 2:30:15| Is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| Well, you know, TIF goes with the specific property, so you don't transfer it in perpetuity as a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9017)|
| 2:30:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9023)|
| 2:30:24| So developers say, you know, we bought it because it had a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9024)|
| 2:30:29| That might have been leverage, but it wasn't a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9029)|
| 2:30:34| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| You know, when they bought the property, seemingly the statement was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9036)|
| 2:30:42| hey, we bought it because it had a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| And that was, you know, part of our plan, and that this TIF will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9045)|
| 2:30:49| I think there's a distinction between being eligible for one than one being assured and guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9049)|
| 2:30:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9054)|
| 2:30:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9055)|
| 2:30:56| So it could have given an indication that it was eligible to reapply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9056)|
| 2:31:04| but for it to be somehow a, you know, right at you buying this blighted, distressed property, as you say, probably wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9064)|
| 2:31:14| I have trouble with a six-year-old building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9074)|
| 2:31:18| Drove by there this past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9078)|
| 2:31:20| Looks to be in great shape with a cornerstone of it being blight, but first you say that that's where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9080)|
| 2:31:28| But you're not going that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9088)|
| 2:31:29| You're going the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9089)|
| 2:31:30| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9090)|
| 2:31:31| So, Mark, do we generally, well, I know you're primarily with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9091)|
| 2:31:40| How many of these green space TIFs have we doled out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9100)|
| 2:31:44| The only one that we've closed so far is the one for South Grove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| which basically built the road work in front of the $2.5 million tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9106)|
| 2:31:52| That's the only green space TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| And that one's pretty controversial, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9114)|
| 2:31:57| No, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9117)|
| 2:31:59| I'm smiling partially because of your question, but also partially because I remember going out there originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9119)|
| 2:32:04| and there was like one scraggly tree, and they tried to argue to me it was blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| And I said, this is not blighted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| I mean, clearly it was a green space TIF, and it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9129)|
| 2:32:13| But, you know, it was successful in terms of building the road work out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9133)|
| 2:32:17| And there they had a serious safety issue off the, you know, John Sevier Highway connecting to Chapman Highway that it helped address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9137)|
| 2:32:23| I paid off early, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9143)|
| 2:32:24| I drive that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9144)|
| 2:32:29| How many TIFs, green space type TIFs, I know you're pretty intimately involved with those statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9149)|
| 2:32:38| I'd say probably I'd say so far since the statute passed in 2004, I'd say probably 20 have probably closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9158)|
| 2:32:47| Certainly the economy, which has, you know, affected real estate development generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9167)|
| 2:32:52| and not in a positive manner has adversely affected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9172)|
| 2:32:57| Over the last six months I've seen I've closed one and am working on three or four where communities are seeing that they need to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9177)|
| 2:33:05| with the public improvements a little bit and found TIFs as a good way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9185)|
| 2:33:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9188)|
| 2:33:09| And I guess my last question on this is to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9189)|
| 2:33:14| I think you indicated that you're, even though the road, which I think Commissioner Wright is referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9194)|
| 2:33:22| that's going to improve the traffic for the school is in phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9202)|
| 2:33:26| You plan on bringing it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| Is that correct or am I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9208)|
| 2:33:30| I think that road would most likely, well, it's going to depend on exactly when the school is planning their construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9210)|
| 2:33:37| but knowing the time frame that they're going to be in, it's going to be pretty much in phase one also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9217)|
| 2:33:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9223)|
| 2:33:44| I guess I'd like to get some kind of commitment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9224)|
| 2:33:49| Commissioner McKenzie, I think the goal we have is we have two tenants that are pretty well committed to the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9229)|
