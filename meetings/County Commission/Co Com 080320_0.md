| 0:00:30| We're here tonight to discuss the petitions to change the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=30)|
| 0:00:38| First, I'd like to say thank you to Don Larch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=38)|
| 0:00:44| I don't see him. Where is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=44)|
| 0:00:47| He's over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=47)|
| 0:00:50| He's over closing the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=50)|
| 0:00:52| I'd like to thank him and his wife, Pat, for maybe doing a few brownies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=52)|
| 0:00:57| taking care of the coffee, getting things ready for us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=57)|
| 0:01:01| Thanks, Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=61)|
| 0:01:03| President of the Corrington Community Club, Joe Longmire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=63)|
| 0:01:07| thanks for lining us up on the building and the space to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=67)|
| 0:01:11| I'd like for those that are members of Knox County Commission to identify yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=71)|
| 0:01:17| Scott Moore from the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=77)|
| 0:01:21| Larry Smith, 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| Rick Briggs, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| Are there other elected officers here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| Anyone campaigning for an office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| I'm not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=92)|
| 0:01:36| Members of the committee are campaigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| What about people who want to give up their office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=99)|
| 0:01:48| We can't lose control of this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| We have law enforcement here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=111)|
| 0:01:58| On the agenda tonight is a discussion of one of the handouts that's over on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| It lists those petition items, and that's what we're here to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=124)|
| 0:02:13| And Mr. Hill here is going to help us work through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| Are you going to give us any background, or what do we want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| I will give you as much background as anyone would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| What I don't want to do, you know, if you've stayed in touch with the newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| and multiple newspapers and television and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| the last thing I want to do is take up too much time just reading a bunch of this timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| That's why we have the handouts for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| I'll be glad to, of course, go as far back as you would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| to answer questions about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| But again, I'm not going to read to you when you have the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| that just wouldn't be necessary when you have the handout there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| The charter amendments, of course, are in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| The one handout that headlines NoxCharterPetition.com history and current timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| that's what I'm referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| There's three or four pages there of timeline and events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| and then you get to the proposed charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| And, of course, those are in bullet point form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| They're not – there's some description underneath each boldface amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| That's pretty self-explanatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| This is not the verbiage, of course, on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| We have a website where you can see the exact verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| And, as a matter of fact, I do have the exact verbiage in my book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| if anyone will look like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| We're trying to keep this to where it's timely, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| and not going to keep folks here until too late and get all questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| I'm Brad Hill, by the way, from District 7 in Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=226)|
| 0:03:53| One of the things that I've noticed over the last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| as we've gone through heading these meetings is that it seems like every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| something has rearranged what may be taking place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| a request that there be a committee to study this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| A charter review committee is formed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| Also today on the headline of the second part of the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| there's the discussion from the law director saying that whatever is presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| has got to be on the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| That's a little bit of a change from where we were two or three days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| thinking it could be later in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| So really, as this moves through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| everything seems to have a little bit of fluidity to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| So what may be said tonight could turn out to be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| I could say something that could be wrong tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| Another thing that we have to realize tonight is that the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| is committed somewhere else, and whoever his backups are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| there's no one here representing the law director of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| So we have to take everything that way with a grain of salt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| The real thing is to get your items or issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| or whatever it is you think to be a question out to be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| to help you clarify where you, citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| think the charter petition review should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| So having said that, if everyone has a handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| the things are kind of lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| That might be what we need to use as sort of our agenda to look at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| that will help us move through the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| and if we do that, we should do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=337)|
| 0:05:45| Let me bring you up to date just a little bit on where we are with this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| Is that at last month's commission meeting, this is the general commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| the charter petition group brought their nine amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| that they wanted to be put on the ballot in August to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| One of the ways these can be put on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| and anyone, just like Dave just mentioned, we don't have any lawyers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| If I say something wrong, stop me, because things always change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| as they delve deeper into how the process goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| But one of the ways that amendments can be put on the ballot for the citizens to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| is that the commission can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| It's called the first reading, and we voted to place seven of those on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| That's the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| You have to have a second reading, and that second reading would be coming up this Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| I think there were some of us, there were two of those amendments that failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| One of those was what's called the consistency amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| and the charter petition group has looked at that, and they've asked that one to be dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| And the other one dealt with the restructuring of the executive branch of the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| We'll talk about that just a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| But then there were seven that went ahead and passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| If at the upcoming general commission meeting on the 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| if we had a second reading and those passed, those would go on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| They would be on the ballot the way they were written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| There were some of us that had some concerns, maybe not about what the amendments were about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| but the wording of the amendments, that there was confusion in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| there was too much covered in some of them, and really the process was moving too fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| We really didn't have a chance to analyze this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| We didn't have a chance to have community discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| And really some of the wording, I think, could be left open for lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| There were some ambiguities there that we needed to clear up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| And that was the reason at the intergovernmental committee last Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| I proposed that we have the mayor appoint a charter review committee to look at all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| and try to clean up some of the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| And the way that works, according to our county charter, is that the mayor appoints nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| There's one out of each of the nine commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| And then he can appoint up to two citizens from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| And he can appoint less than that, but there has to be at least one citizen there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| and there has to be a total of 19 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| So if you vote on something, you can, I guess, break the tie was what the reasoning behind that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| But he can appoint up to two citizens from each district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| which would make 18 citizens and nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| So he can appoint up to 27 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| And then that committee, in the open, this would fall under the Sunshine Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| would have discussions on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| They can review the whole charter and make changes, make other suggestions for amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| But what the real purpose of this is is to look at those nine amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| give us a chance to discuss them further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| clean up the language that was ambiguous or could cause confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| or could cause what we call unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| And then if the majority of the committee that the mayor had appointed felt that these were good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=542)|
| 0:09:10| and we wanted to move those on, we would tell the mayor we think these are good, we move them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| Now they, again, this is one of those things that sort of changed as we delved into this more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| Then that goes directly to the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| I think the other night some of us said that it goes back to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| to vote on and to make amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| But that's really not the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| For those that pass, it goes directly on to the election commission to be placed on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| The other issue that came up that was in the newspaper today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| and John Owings, who is the county law director, called me about this, I think it was two days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| And his, no, no, originally our intention was to try to put this on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=586)|
| 0:09:54| That would give us longer to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| We also felt that it would be more citizens would vote in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| because that is going to be a contested presidential election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| But when we read this further in the county charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| and even in the county charter the terms are a little vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| It says the next general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| It doesn't say if it's a county general election or a state general election or a national general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| It says the next general election after the mayor appoints the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| They have to return their recommendations no less than 60 days before the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=621)|
| 0:10:31| or no less than 45, between 60 and 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| They've got to make their announcement on what their recommendations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| And I guess that would give them time to put that on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| Is that your interpretation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| And so if after the mayor appoints these people, let me back up just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| then it comes back to the commission, the people that the mayor has appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| The list will come back, and the commission will either have to agree to all of them or reject all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=654)|
| 0:11:04| They can't go through and say, I like this one, I like this one, I don't like this one, I like this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| I don't like this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| It has to be an all or none vote on the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| And once that vote has successfully passed, then that committee, the Charter Review Committee, exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=673)|
| 0:11:21| and then they can start the deliberations on these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| And again, this is all in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| The public's invited to come and discuss these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| We get public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| We can look at the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| We'll have attorneys from both sides to really get these things cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| And let me just give you, I'll give you an example if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| Now some of this has already been done by the charter petition group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| There was a word in there, and this had to do with whether county employees can serve, not run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=704)|
| 0:11:51| but can serve on the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| And that was the definition of a county employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| I'm going to paraphrase part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| It was required compensation directly or indirectly by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| And I was wondering, what is required indirect compensation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| Well, they looked at that, and they said, well, we'll take this word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| You see, indirect compensation, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| And I think that could lead to lawsuits, confusion, and who knows what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| But they've taken that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| And I think that is an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| We took it out because it came from our attorney, who that was his wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| And when this issue came up, Mr. McAdams said it was our attorney that put the wording in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=754)|
| 0:12:42| and our attorney who decided, based on feedback, that I guess that's really not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| You know, again, this is fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| Again, the spirit of these amendments is what's most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| And I've said this over and over again and been to many of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| and I hope this is beneficial for you, as I hope it's been for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| But the spirit of these amendments, as far as checks and balances go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| cannot create greater problems for this county down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| We all agree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| We can't have lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| We can't have legal battles over something that we're trying to make better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| as in more accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| So that's the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| I gave that as an example, not really as criticism, but just as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| When you have people sit down, you can clean up the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| and then the amendment is very clear what it means, and people know what they're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| And I think that's what we have the opportunity to do with the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| and the Tribal Review Committee is look at every one of these amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| and, first of all, be certain that the amendments that are going to be on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| that everyone agrees that they're legally clear, they're legally claimed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| and that just anybody who looks at these can understand what they're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| And we're not arguing about some words, but just as brandish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| and it's what we're really talking about and what we're going to have our debate over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| is really the essence of what they mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| Is this good or bad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| And then people can look at that and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| But because we were moving so quickly, I think we thought we needed to slow the process down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| and then try to really clarify what are in these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| Okay. Does everyone have a handout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| And also, okay, also I would ask that you have a feedback sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| so you can mark a feedback sheet for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| Feedback sheets are confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| You don't put your name on it, in other words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| The reason that I ask that you have one now, because you can make your notes as we go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| it doesn't take your time when we're through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Also, I'd like to draw your attention to the fact that mark your feedback sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| with which district you reside in, just in case someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| we need to give this information to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| Now, what we're going to do is use the handout and just sort of go through it point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| If you, again, turn to page three or four, I guess three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=909)|
| 0:15:17| not as in front and back copies, but the third sheet of paper, proposed charter amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| the first one being we'll just go by bullet point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| Number one, the ordinance, simply put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| establish a number of signatures required for a citizen-driven charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| Basically, for citizens to be able to place any charter amendment on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| the way it was done before the law changed in Nashville was, to my understanding in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| it was attached to a particular bill that had nothing to do with charter amendments and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| and the law was changed to 15% of the total registered voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| and the former rule was 15% of those who voted in the last gubernatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| So, obviously, that's a smaller number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| and other referendums that have made it through have been under a different set of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=971)|
| 0:16:20| The number of signatures, if I recall correctly, in the last referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| I believe it was 18,000 or 20,000 signatures, something like that, because that was the factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| In this particular case, we would have to have 36,000 valid signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| so we'd have to collect 40,000 just in case 10% are duplicates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| or they don't live where they're supposed to live to be able to sign a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| This change of this amendment would not affect any petition drive this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| It would affect a petition drive down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| Any petition drive we put forward, if there was one this year, which we're hoping there's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| it wouldn't affect it. We'd still have to have 40,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| So this is just to take it back to the old way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Again, you can see some synopsis below it as far as what I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| Any questions about that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| I have a question. I was just curious, what caused the change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| Why was it changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| Well, I don't know for certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| I know what I've heard, and that's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| What I've heard is there was a development-related something in Nashville related to Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1048)|
| 0:17:37| and that this made it in, and it was under a former administration, not even the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1057)|
| 0:17:44| I believe it was a city, a former city administration, that pushed for this with the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| again, this is pure hearsay, of making it more difficult to get things on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| And so we would like to be able to go back to where folks like yourself or anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| they don't have to work so hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| And frankly, 15 percent of those who go out and vote is a pretty good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| Fifteen percent of the total registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| It's just twice as difficult for anyone to get something on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| Anything else about number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| Just to be clear, we've got 400,000 people in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| and even at today's standard, that's only 10 percent of the people in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| who could possibly cause a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| If you include children, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| How many people voted in the last election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| If we're including children, you can't vote or pay taxes, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| Was it about 50,000 or 60,000 people that voted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| 90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| Was it 240,000 registered voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| You know, I've heard several numbers, a couple hundred thousand, 250 registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| I think it's simple arithmetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| 240,000 is based on the number you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| The number that's given here, how many signatures that would be required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| if you do your math on that, it's about 240,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| Our requirement is 36, so we're saying 40 just to pad it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| But that's registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| Those who actually go out and vote, 100,000 voters I believe is a pretty good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| Gubernatorial elections, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| I just know 100,000, 120,000, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| You need 18,000, 20,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| That's the number that stuck in my head from years ago, the last referenda there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| that those folks had to go out and they tried to top 20 just in case they had 10 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| or 15 percent in error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| Any other questions on number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| I do, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Can you tell us which ones of these either passed through the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| without much discussion or, you know, pretty unanimously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| Was there any that were announced unanimously first to get them on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| who could go to the first reading anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| There were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| I will share the mic quietly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| If you just look at the way that this is organized on your sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| all of those that he's going to discuss passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| There were seven that passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| And if you look on the next sheet at the bottom, the consistency amendment did not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| And then the reorganization, what I call the reorganization of the executive branch of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| this is where the mayor appoints some of the constitutional offices, not the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| but some of the other constitutional offices and the dean offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| That one failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| And what they call the consistency amendment failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| But I'd also like to point out that the charter petition group now has withdrawn the consistency amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| so that one will not be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| And I think also that a lot of commissioners just passed it through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| so that there could be a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| And so, you know, I would be interested to know, you know, what commissioners, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| which ones were unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| It seems to me like there were one or two that were unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| There were actually three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| There were actually three that were unanimous and then four that passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| But you could, we're talking 13 votes or 14, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| Seven passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| So which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| There were like three of them that only had one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| And that's the ones I want to know, which ones, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| does there seem to be a general consensus on what the issue is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| Is that on the county website that you actually vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| Yeah, the Knox News actually has a slide about how each commissioner voted on each one of the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1305)|
| 0:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| And, Lisa, I heard commissioners say they, one or two say they voted against all of them and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| and I heard Chairman Strickland say three were unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| So to be honest with you, I didn't keep a vote by vote to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| I was thinking that that might be a key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| But Knox News does have the tally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| I tell you, the red I've got out there is where I'm going to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| There you go, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| To those my recollection, and that may not be very good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| and I see we have Commissioner Moore and Smith and some of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| I'll tell you the ones that I think passed, what I would call passed unanimously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| one of them, we'll come up to it shortly, is the nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| And I believe it passed pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| Do you remember Scott or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| I know I voted, I think, for two of them and voted against the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| Because I know Commissioner Lambert was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| I think you did win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| Commissioner Lambert, I think, he liked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| because he'd gone through this petition process after they did the will tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| and I know he supported that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| And I believe it was pretty strong support, pretty strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| See, actually, I'll be honest with you, this is already in the county charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| and I'd probably have to get a lawyer to explain to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| look, in this county charter that we have here, this amendment's already in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| But then the state passed, and they mentioned this here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| the state enacted a code that changed it, but it's still in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| And I guess by passing this again, we just put back the end that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| But it's been there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| So anybody that voted for them is really voting for the charter we have already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| That's an important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Yeah, and I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| I wish we had a lawyer here because sometimes I say these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| That's the way I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Personally, I'm glad we don't have a lawyer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| I needed a break from lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| Number two, restructuring county commission to elect one representative per district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| and two at large with staggered terms in nonpartisan elections, it says, nonpartisan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| with unified commission and school board districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| Now, since this was printed, we have reconsidered the third line there, more or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1446)|
| 0:24:14| eliminating that third line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| This particular amendment would not be submitted as nonpartisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| And the school board district redistricting or paralleling school board districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| created a variety of opinions that might not have been a consensus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1469)|
| 0:24:36| but I think there was an overall consensus that this complicated things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| and allowed for school, those districts that could possibly not have a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| or at least a high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| It just threw a complication into it that we didn't feel like was worth struggling with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1488)|
| 0:24:56| because people didn't like it for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| People weren't crazy about that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| And Dr. Briggs had something good to say about that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| I didn't mean to rush you, but now it looks like it comes down to it's just a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| of whether or not county commission remains at the current number level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| or has changed to a different number level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| And if there's something about that that you don't understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| then you need to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| And the question is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| No, the question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Come on, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Just for the people here that haven't been to any other forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| the Baker Center study that they went by, a county our size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| the normal county commission is 17 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| We have 19, so we're basically two older than normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| And I've tried to ask them where they came up with 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| and I guess not putting words in Brad's mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| but they said that they thought 17 was too many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| so somehow we just came up with 11 because 11 is smaller than 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| But you do see the point that I'm trying to make right now is that this particular amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| boils down to whether the size of commission should change its numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| Now, then, if you understand that's what it's about, what would be the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| I believe that the question now is going to go to the charter review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| and they will then come out with something based on what you're all's responses are to the questionnaire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| which is how do you feel about that, and you think it shouldn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| Well, in serving on county commission since I just started my second term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| and I will be gone in 2010, so it's not going to affect me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| but I can tell you that one person in a district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| it's hard to be really constituent service because there are a lot of people who call us every single day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| and I try to get back to as many people as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| And I can tell you, too, that it's very difficult, and we are the closest to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| Right, and you're singing to the choir because I found out people have my telephone number and they have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| And I don't think, I'm in absolute agreement with you if you're stretched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| I am stretched from Andersonville Pike through Quarrington through Mascot to Carter to Kodak Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1646)|
| 0:27:36| and then back into Ramsey and Forks River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| I understand that, but that's not a question about whether or not you think the number ought to be increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| May I add one more thing about the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| One more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| The state statute, and it's for all 95 counties across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| the minimum county commissioners, and I know we're a charter form of government, is nine members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| You have to have at least nine members in Tennessee and no more than 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| And, you know, there's a lot of counties in Tennessee that probably don't have 30,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| that may have nine or 12 or 15 county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| So the city of Knoxville, let me add one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Yeah, one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| The city of Knoxville only has, they have nine members, but Knox County, you've got to remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| the city doesn't have jails, libraries, schools, health departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| There's so many more issues that we deal with in a budget other than I'm just kind of paving roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| and picking up your leaves and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| And I think there are, not in this meeting because I haven't heard from anyone else yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| but in the last couple of meetings that I've been to last night and the night before last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| I think I see a lot of agreement with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| So that's why I'm saying, do you have a question about what this petition item is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| It's changing the number of people that are on commission from one number to another number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| and that information should be given to the charter review committee as your input through the questionnaire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1737)|
| 0:29:06| Was there a question on this side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| Just a second right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| Yeah, I remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| I would like to know what the committee came up with the advantage for reducing the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| What would be our advantage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| The question is, what would be the advantage to reducing the number of commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1761)|
| 0:29:28| There was some feedback, a great deal of feedback, a theme of feedback about streamlining government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1768)|
| 0:29:36| And whether, I cannot give you a quantified number as to how many people in these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1776)|
| 0:29:45| these five meetings, specified nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| I think I did see it once in one of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| But when we did, Scott is absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| The research from the Baker Center showed 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| In black communities where you have an elected mayor and an elected, there's a second office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| exactly like we have, 17 was the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| In other forms of government, there's 160 black counties out there, nine was the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1810)|
| 0:30:19| So what we did is we looked at going from 19 to 17 and thought that was kind of silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| What districts are you going to have one, or are we going to take one away from West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| where there's a population base that requires three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| Our other option was one per district or zero, and zero is not an option for obvious reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| So one brings it to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Well, one per district, we thought, well, and looking at the city, I mean, look at the city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| They had large seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| The idea came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| It went around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| I do recall vaguely during the whole debate process, the vigorous debate of teens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| where someone would say 12 and someone would say 15, and it went round and round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| And what we brought forward through that Knox County One Question process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| are only recommendations that we were unanimous on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| And we took so many votes over such lengthy days on anyone's proposal of each of these nine, of variations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1868)|
| 0:31:20| And 11 is how we came up with a unanimous vote to streamline the legislative branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| Some in that room said radically, and some said, no, this is totally acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| It ran the gamut, too, the debate in that room last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| But in this particular case, we came up with that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| And so I wish I could give you a scientific method as to how it happened, but I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| I have a bit of a different take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1908)|
| 0:31:55| Even these gentlemen who run for office will tell you that to run in a district costs anywhere from $18,000 to $22,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1915)|
| 0:32:03| To run countywide, it's going to cost a minimum of $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| So, you know, where are the candidates going to come from with that kind of money, and how are they going to be funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1927)|
| 0:32:14| What that means to you folks is you're going to have one commissioner, and Farragut's going to have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| That's as plain and simple as I can cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| Since we're doing Jeopardy here, what is the question today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| What is the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| It ought to be 19 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| I've been in this county all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| I don't know where the metro consolidation people are coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| That's what they are, trying to compare county government to city government and trying to put it all under one umbrella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1960)|
| 0:32:48| And that's ludicrous, and that's my opinion on the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| I've got some more opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Was there another question in this area right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| I have a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| Today I made two phone calls today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| One I made to Metro Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| They have 40 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| I called Blount County, and they have 25 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| I promise I'm not going to ask a question on every one, but my question on this one is, and y'all may not have the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=1992)|
| 0:33:20| is the Charter Committee, as soon as the mayor appoints one, going to consider proposals to have more commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2000)|
| 0:33:29| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| That's not a question I can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| Do you know if all of these amendments are going to be considered, or are there going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| He has not made his charge yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| So what you don't know is what your district is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| Is the committee going to appoint them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| Is this what you all are doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| We won't know until the official word comes down as to who's on this committee and what are they charged to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| I just found out today that this committee, and you reaffirmed it this evening, is under Sunshine Law, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| But that's news to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Every day there seems to be news in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| It hasn't been established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| The committee's not been established yet, and this is a noticed meeting, so this is where we're supposed to talk about it in the sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2058)|
| 0:34:26| Someone used the word preclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| That does not preclude the original committee from going forward with a signature collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2068)|
| 0:34:36| It does not preclude the commission from passing something with two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| And it doesn't preclude the mayor from doing whatever the mayor's going to do, Commissioner Briggs' request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2082)|
| 0:34:50| So we don't know any of those answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| And when the mayor comes forward, if he does, that still the commission has to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| They could turn him down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| So we have no answer to any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| I would much rather have a committee appointed by 19 people instead of one man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| I've got a feeling that this committee is going to be leaning toward the mayor's personal interpretation instead of county commission, who represents the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2107)|
| 0:35:17| Well, that's off the point of the nine things that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| You'll have to get a charter amendment to do it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| So to back up and plow just a little bit of this ground again, we've talked about this issue of reducing county commission from a certain number to a certain number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2125)|
| 0:35:36| Does anyone have another question about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| Mr. Blommeyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Dr. Briggs, a while ago, was talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| This might have been just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| I was talking about the 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| I mean, nine plus two at large meant 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| But you mentioned, it might have just been a discussion that you were talking about, that they could have one elected, but the mayor could appoint two more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2151)|
| 0:36:02| That's not for the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| That's for the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| What he can do, he can appoint one commissioner from each district and then up to two citizens from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2169)|
| 0:36:17| I didn't hear that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| But there has to be a minimum of ten citizens appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| And see, that would make a Charter Review Committee of 19 persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| Or if he appointed two in each district plus the nine, that would be 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| With regard to this amendment, you know, you were talking about that you took off the school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| And that was because Mr. Lithold, I think, frankly, pointed out that, you know, that was a lot more complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2205)|
| 0:36:52| But the problem is, here in the 8th district, it affects us more than anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| Because we have, like, for example, in Gibbs, those people going to that middle school do not, you know, their school board member is in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2216)|
| 0:37:06| And so they don't vote for that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Is there anything that we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| I mean, I understand that there are problems with aligning the school districts with the commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2232)|
| 0:37:19| But do you, and I apologize, I didn't see the whole discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| But is there any remedy to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| Or are we just stuck with school board members that we don't vote for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| Let me address that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| Because I was one of the people that had a lot of concerns over linking the school districts geographically with the commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2256)|
| 0:37:44| It really makes it a lot simpler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| But part of the reason that we can have this Charter Review Committee, we can actually come back and look at that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| But what I prefer, and I sent a letter out to every member of the school board, first of all, notifying them about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| And they didn't, I'll tell you, except for one person, I don't think they even knew that this was coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| This was even after the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| And one person was aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| And I think part of the problem is they've been preoccupied with selecting a new school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| But this does give the school board, who I think should have some input into this, is this practical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| Is it impractical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Is it a good thing or a bad thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| Or do we need to do it a little bit differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| But by slowing the process down, see, we only had until Monday where we were going to vote on this for a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| And then it's going to be on the ballot if it passes its law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| And that's part of the reason for slowing it down, is that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| I mean, the charter petition group has dropped it, but we can bring that back up in the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| We may want to put it back in if we get the input from the school board saying this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| Or maybe they have another suggestion that's even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2328)|
| 0:38:55| We're almost within a minute of being on the next number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| I was just going to say, Lisa, again, the intent, the spirit was, in my interpretation, to keep it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| I mean, it was just to, you know, District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| I mean, you would have one representative of each body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| And then the complications came up about schools, the quantity of schools and overloading here and short there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| And that just kind of spun in a good way, spun to where we were more informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| And I want to back up just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| We put this through the legal mill, and it still obviously didn't – the mill didn't work so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| But I just want to – we didn't just create these without counsel advising heavily, and obviously we're still in this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2378)|
| 0:39:46| Number three, conflict of interest on an administrative matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| Obviously, we can cite specific examples here in the last year of where someone in the administration has a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2391)|
| 0:39:59| It's found out after the fact, after monies have gone here or there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| This is to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| If someone has a conflict of interest, they are to acknowledge it and not be a part of that decision-making process on the administrative side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2405)|
| 0:40:14| This was one that was approved by the county commission on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| With almost unanimous or unanimous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| It was unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| Yeah, Larry, I think that was unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm speaking for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| Any questions on the conflict of interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| At all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| Number – if not – number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| Would be the establishing of an independent office of inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| This is another one that has had some lively debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| We have – right now we have an internal auditor that exists, that performs audits, annual audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2451)|
| 0:41:00| He has a job to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| This is in no way targeted at him necessarily or personally or anything or critiqued on his capabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| The fact of the matter is we felt an independent officer of inspector general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| which Dr. Briggs can speak to the advantage of IG in the military service and other capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| This was an office that – frankly, this is my – the most important to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| simply because if you have an independent auditor who can go anywhere in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| he or she chooses and look at any department, sheriff, school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| which that's the majority of the budget, 80% of the budget probably, 70% to 80% are those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| County commission, which doesn't have a whole lot of budgetary issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| And the administration, obviously, that's the topic of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| As far as the administration in history, it's interesting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| I can get into further explanation justifying something like this, but I'm looking for an independent –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| we are looking for an independent auditor and not someone that's under the guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| and direction of county commission, which it's been said out in the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| that this will be the very same position, and I promise you it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| and not one branch of government's in control of this individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| And this individual will be vetted through a human resources process, yes, nominated by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| but yes, having to be approved by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| So, again, it goes back to checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| This is not the same as the internal auditor we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| And then looking at that, as he has tried to explain it for us to understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| what do you have, questions about this explanation and the questions right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| This independent inspector general, who would he answer to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| Who would be independent and doesn't fall under county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2565)|
| 0:42:52| The mayor appoints him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| It's not – I don't believe he said the mayor appoints him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| That's what this says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| The mayor appoints and the commission approves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| The commission has to approve the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| It's not a direct appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| The commission has to approve all these department heads we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| We've gone through that at 3 o'clock yesterday and the past three times in the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| I'm embarrassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| My family in Memphis calls us the fools of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| I'm embarrassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| All I'm trying to do is get us out by 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| Can we wait comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| No, I prefer that you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| I would prefer that your comments be on these sheets so that they're documented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2616)|
| 0:43:43| and they get to the commission that's going to study these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| What I'd like for you to understand is what you may question about how this is worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| I believe I had a good question about how it was worded and what it meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| Are you still questioning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| She didn't get an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| I've never gotten an answer as to who this person would answer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| Who holds him responsible for what he does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| Is it the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| Let me just take a – try to get an understanding of the person is independent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2651)|
| 0:44:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| So it takes three things to get this person sort of on the payroll or in a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| The position is advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| Lots of people respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| It's sort of like getting appointed to county commission in the last appointment cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| Everyone has to raise all the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| and eventually the mayor selected out of that pool of people that applied a particular name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2688)|
| 0:44:57| for then which county commission is going to have to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| So then the county commission would oversee what he does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| The mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Let me read you verbatim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| So there's no interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| I can read this to you, and this has got to answer your question, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| If this doesn't, I don't know what I'm going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| Office of Inspector General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| Effective September 1, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| Again, past this current – a lot of these are past this current mayor's tenure for reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| There is hereby established an independent office of inspector general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| and the county office of internal audit is hereby abolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| The purpose of the independent office of inspector general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| is to conduct management audits, reviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| and research of all branches of Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| to recommend ways to strengthen management functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| increase cost effectiveness and citizen responsiveness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| improve internal controls, and root out waste, fraud, and abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| Evidence of any discovered incidents of fraud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| shall be forwarded to the Knox County district attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| The inspector general shall be chosen through a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| that commences with the request of qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| issued by the Knox County Purchasing Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| at the direction of the county mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| review of qualifications by the Knox County Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| the ultimate appointment by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| The inspector general shall serve for a term of six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| at which the appointment process will occur again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| staggered for reasons of not paralleling political offices that are responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| However, there are no restrictions on reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| The salary of the said inspector general is hereby fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| at the same salary as the law director and payable in the same manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| The commission shall, using the advice of the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| and review of successful inspector general functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| in the other similar communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| set a budget for said office to pay all reasonable and necessary expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| such as the employment of additional personnel by the inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| The commission shall provide suitable offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| a word I can't pronounce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| and conveniences for the inspector general and his or her personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| The commission shall also furnish the inspector general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| with appropriate equipment, furniture, supplies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| and may be necessary to the performance of his or her duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| Last section, short paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| This ordinance shall take effect upon adoption of affirmative vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| of the members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| That's just about how it goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| That is the ordinance as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2848)|
| 0:47:36| I was just going to say, ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| and I may be off base on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| because a lot of what we've talked about is how they're appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| but as a taxpayer, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| obviously the county commission is going to be overseeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| the management of the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| but ultimately, we're going to get reports as taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| overall about the entire county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| how the mayor's running his office, how the sheriff's running his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| Ultimately, that's the independent part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| is that that person is going to answer to the taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| and also have help from others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| I may be wrong, but that's how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| Not necessarily, if there's controls in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| Let me have your attention for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| There's a question on the floor, Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| Well, I was just going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| this person would act without the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| telling them to do anything or the mayor or anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| They would do a running audit constantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| and if a problem was found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| then that inspector general reports to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| did you say district attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| Yeah, in the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| So, they're not really under anybody's authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| That's the whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| No, the commission appoints them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| What the mayor does, the mayor says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| we need to find, and this is my interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| and again, let me tell you, I'm not a lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| but my interpretation from what it says here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| is that the mayor directs the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| and I'll repeat what Brad just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| the mayor directs the county purchasing department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| to review the qualifications of the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| Then it goes to the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| to see, does this person, does he have a good reputation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| Are there any issues that the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| has concerns about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Then he's appointed by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| I mean, that's what the wording says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| I think that's partially right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| Now, and let me have your attention for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| Let me have your attention for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| This is not saying this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| that should be done or not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| This is a proposition that's going to be given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| to maybe the charter review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| of which then it has to be placed on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| That's a hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| And then it has to get past discerning voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| That's an even larger hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| So we're just discussing the questions and answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| of what it is that's being placed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| or what it is that's on the paper right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| And I want you to express your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| That's why I want these handouts filled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| But you're not, there's no one here to receive it verbally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| Well, you guys can hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| I've heard it last night and the night before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| And I'll hear it Saturday morning again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| Well, they're here to ask questions also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| And maybe they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Maybe they shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3050)|
| 0:50:57| You say that having independence of the inspector general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| at some point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| the legislative body approves the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| unless you're going to give this attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| this inspector general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| the authority of taxing, a taxing authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| So at some point, and I'm not going to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| and I don't know if it's ever been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| but you get somebody and say the county commission says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| it's got its way out of line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| and you cut his budget in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| How can you be independent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| being under the umbrella of the legislative body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| There are lots of things that will make this work and not work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| but I think the issue that's before us is to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| or ask questions about what's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| Actually, it is defined in the amendment what has to be proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| It says how many employees he must have if he needs legal...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| Well, this could end up, I think, with a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| but it says that he has, he shall, he shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| You can take each person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| Okay, I'll change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| I'll read it verbatim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| The commission shall provide suitable offices, appurtenances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| that's a word we had trouble with before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| and conveniences for the inspector general and his or her personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| And that's in here, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| The commission also shall furnish the inspector general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| with appropriate equipment, furniture, supplies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| as may be necessary for the performance of his duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| So I think if he says that they're cutting me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| they're not letting me do my duties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| I think that would be probably a legitimate challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| Okay, we had one right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| Commissioner Briggs, how many employees would he need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| Does he need an attorney? How many days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| I mean, the citizens of Knox County, I'm for smaller government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| Not clean, new departments, big budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| So, I mean, I think it's fair to have those things spelled out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| to the citizen before they go vote and not after they vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| I'm not taking Jay's position on any of these tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| I'm saying, and I had, you know, last, I guess it was two nights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| when these things run together, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| I had mentioned that there were concerns about the cost of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| So the current auditing system that we have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| does it, do they audit the fee offices as well as the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| and the school district and all of those things now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| Do we know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| Yes, they take sampling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| We've only got one man who runs the auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| and we have two employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| And their whole budget is like $180,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| And it's not like line-by-line auditing, it's like sampling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| No, but we hire an auditing firm once a year to audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| And that's the same ones that got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| that didn't get any of the problems that we had already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| No, they caught it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| It was in the report, most of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| But what you have is, we've never had this problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| but when you have people on the very top who oversee all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| who break the rules, and who hold all the branches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| it's very difficult for anybody to actually do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| I think it probably happened before, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Maybe not this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| Thanks, Commissioner Moore, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| I made this point last night, and I know Scott doesn't like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| but I'm going to make the point again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| because, again, we've all seen each other on multiple nights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| and we'll see each other at future meetings, regardless of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| Folks, the fact is, we have an internal auditor that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| has been involved with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| has a draft that's now becoming final, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| $200,000 in misappropriations, innocent mistakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| paying sales tax all the way to charges of fraud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| and all points in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| $200,000 over five years, where I'm just guessing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| the county's reinvested about $3 billion in tax dollars, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| You know, two and a half, three and a half, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| But something about $600 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| It took five years to get to this point on that particular audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| It makes me wonder about the effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| Again, I don't know the man, I've heard nothing but good things about him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| But the bigger issue, Lisa, to me, anyway, as a taxpayer, is the independence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3314)|
| 0:55:21| is the fact that, as Mr. Owens said last night in the open meeting at New Harvest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| he is an employee of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| Now, county commission could have directed him to audit the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| could have directed him to audit the administration, schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| I don't know what commission did over the last five years, as far as audit goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| And all different departments don't even know what the routine is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| But what I know is that $200,000 in one sliver of one part of our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3344)|
| 0:55:51| P-cards, as it pertains, P-cards and other expenses as it pertains to top-level managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| it makes me wonder, was there any innocent mistakes made in the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| any innocent mistakes made in the school system to some other degree of more than innocent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| An independent, it gets back to the issue, do you want independence in an auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| or do you want them directed, and as Mr. Owens put it, which I've never heard this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| an employee of a county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| And I'm just saying that within the sheriff, schools, administration, and county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| there's somebody in the middle that is independent, that can't go anywhere, that is well-funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| And when you spend $600,000, $700,000 a year, I think we can afford a couple hundred thousand dollars for a department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3393)|
| 0:56:40| What was your thinking in not making it an elected position instead of an independent position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| What was the reasoning for doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| If you were going after independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| It wasn't my thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| It wasn't my thinking in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| But what the group came back with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| Trying to understand, you know, why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| What the group came back with was a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| When you say appointment, it sounds really simple, that one guy is putting this guy into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| or this gal, this guy or gal into place when you say appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| And this process is not like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| And what I read to you was a process where candidates apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| Candidates are submitted to the purchasing department, which I thought it was human resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| but it's purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| We're purchasing an inspector general, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| And they go through that vetting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| The mayor makes his choice, sure, or her choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| But then commission has every right to see if this is a crony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| to see if it's a grill, this individual who's been recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| and up or down, appoint them or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| And that's checks and balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| We've got to take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| I mean, not a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| We've got to pause for just a moment because someone has snuck in on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| Commissioner Elaine Davis is here with us now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| so be sure and welcome her when we're through with all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| We're ready for the next point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| Mr. Green, you've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| What's the chain of command going to be over this inspector general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| Or is he going to be a top cop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| I think this will be probably, if not the most important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| one of the top two most important positions in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| And I would say this position actually, to me anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| would trump the mayor, county commission chair, sheriff, and school board chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| I believe this person would be independent and be able to, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| address concerns when whistleblowers come forward, address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| And I think this would, in effect, top cop, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| that's an interesting way of putting it, but top counsel, top inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3532)|
| 0:58:59| If he's not looking back over his shoulder or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| If he's doing it wrong, that's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| He can be fired by county commission by two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| If he is in the wrong and if it isn't proven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| he can be removed from office like any other appointment or department head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| Again, it's a super majority of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| But I imagine the bar would have to be pretty high that he had a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| The next one, number five, I'm being prompted to move on, is restrictions on nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3572)|
| 0:59:39| Again, this one passed unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| Any questions about nepotism is pretty self-explanatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| but if anyone has any specific questions, fire away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3586)|
| 0:59:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| County commissioners cannot be employed by other branches of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3595)|
| 1:00:02| This is another one that had quite a bit of debate last summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| simply because, well, we had retirees from all walks of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| We had former educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| I believe we had a law enforcement official or two there as well, I can't recall, in the final 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3615)|
| 1:00:21| But we had a nice wide variety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| We had cases made for excluding this group or excluding that group as far as county government goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| But an unanimous vote came through that we can't be exclusive of any particular group of Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| That if you want to run for commissioner, you know the rules before you ever consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| Let's put it out there a couple of years in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| And that if you're a teacher or a deputy and you're looking or you're getting closer to retirement or what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3643)|
| 1:00:50| if you're in the school system and you can make this change, then it won't hurt your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| But if you make this choice to go really from any job down in pay to $22,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3655)|
| 1:01:02| our commissioners don't get compensated a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| So that's where this one came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| That you will not be overseeing any budgets or any decisions that you have a direct employment related to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3668)|
| 1:01:18| So that's where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Any questions in that regard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| If you're retired, you can't bill county commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| If you're not taking a county paycheck from another department, then yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| If you're retired from the county, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| My understanding is it is strictly an employment contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| You're employed by the county in another department, not if you're retired from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| Mr. Gillis said indirect compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| That amendment, that ordinance says direct or indirect compensation in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| So you drop the indirect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| It did say that, but it doesn't now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| So what if you're wired for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| Does that make you ineligible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| Number seven here, conflicts of interest on a voted matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| County commission passed a conflict of interest rule through the ethics also established the ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3739)|
| 1:02:29| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| You have to acknowledge it, but there's no refusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| Can we read a little background?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| And what we're saying is to go a step further, two steps further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| Thank you, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| Is there another question on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| Conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| The last two are simple and not so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| The simple one being the consistency amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| Again, we took that as a housecleaning amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| Come to find out after further charter review, there's duplication there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| That is not needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| There's already something in the charter that covers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| And so the consistency amendment has been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| I'm assuming there will be no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| I'm assuming it's not an issue anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| And the last one being another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| This one did not pass the first reading of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| This one being a rather contentious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| Again, there's a lot of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| There are a lot of bullet points there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| The bottom line to this one, as best I can put it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| is the fact that we have a situation where the executive branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3813)|
| 1:03:39| when we restructure, again, after this current mayor's term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3819)|
| 1:03:45| we actually bring the fee offices under the mayor's supervision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| and commission's budgetary supervision, the mayor and commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| These offices would be appointed and not elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| So people who say you're taking away our vote for these particular offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| they're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| This does take away the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| This does put these fee offices, like other department heads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| under the responsibility of the mayor to vet qualified candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| send them to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| and commission to be able to see and grill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| and know exactly who they're approving or declining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| be it cronies, be it whomever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| I know this big conspiracy opportunity has been brought up to me a couple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| Actually, my quote was in the Found City Focus last week about, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| I guess there's a chance for a conspiracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| And there is, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| You could have the sheriff come out of retirement, run for mayor, become mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| and have a lot of friends on commission, bring back people from the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| put them all in offices, whether they're qualified or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| and they all get approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| and they would have to do a great job for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| if that conspiracy could make it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| My guess would be that there would be a few commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| that would know that's going on and probably cause an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| and then you'd probably have 12 different media outlets, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| shining sunshine on that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| But in this particular case, this one, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Do we take these from voting to not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| Bringing them under supervision from a budgetary standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| it's a small number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| It's $9 million in 2006 of $600 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| But it's really a principal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| For this group, it was a principal issue that said there needs to be supervision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| as opposed to these independent political machines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| that we have in Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| and that's how our group viewed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| Now, this one is last, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| But we're going to just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| Let me say something myself because this is the one, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| where the comment and the questions come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| Having said that, you can make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| Let me tell you what I think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| We can look at the appointed school superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| which was the worst thing that has ever happened in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| I'm going to tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| We're taking away the votes of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| The people in this county are pretty smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| They've got sense enough to elect somebody that they know is going to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| So we screw up every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| We get rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| But let's elect these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| Let's don't start appointing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| All that does is start appointing people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| and then you pull together consolidated government and metro government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| So all we're doing is making a bigger bureaucracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| We need to elect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| I'm for voting for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| And Greg, last night, you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| would I be for voting for people in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| Yeah, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| And what I need to make sure of is I see you've got the comment form in your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| I've got my comment form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| I'll do it in big bold print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| The people that are going to receive that comment are probably not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| They're in the committee that's to be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| Well, y'all can hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| Stick it in your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| You mentioned the sheriff could bring this on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| but if Brad's going to be the next mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| which I think the rumor is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| then this certainly would be in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| He'd be filling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| Do you think I have a chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| No, I don't think you've got a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| But the rumor is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| Just answer that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| Because your opinion obviously means a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| Would it be possible to have some kind of oversight if they are still elected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4063)|
| 1:07:49| I mean, the problem is not having some oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| You know, I'll tell you that's been a lot of my concern, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| And I don't want to fall back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| Dave will cut me off here, and he should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| But I'd go back to the inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| And for the sake of time, I'm not going to say anything more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| But if you have a strong inspector general who has the authority to get in their offices, that can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| And I think there are things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| You know, Commissioner Moore ran for an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| and he pointed out some very good ways where he thought, I believe it was a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| he thought you could pull out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| And the point being, there's inefficiencies there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| You have people that really study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| And, you know, that campaign's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| But I think even Commissioner Moore would say that there's a lot of inefficiencies in there that could save the taxpayers some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| And he's very good at pointing those things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| So it is possible to have oversight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| If we had a strong – see, I would – yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| Just, the county commission does have oversight of these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| It's been a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| We approve their budgets every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| I mean, the sheriff's department comes and the mayor recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| But once it gets to the legislative body, the legislative body can do whatever they choose to do with the majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4133)|
| 1:09:00| And Steve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| I want to point out one thing because I think that's a good question, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| Now, the argument for these things is that you have a mayor that appoints you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| and that mayor can get in there and make those people be efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| And, I mean, I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| But, you know, we've heard all of the potential problems that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| Part of what the inspector general does is he not only just looks for fraud, waste, abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| He also looks for efficiencies, makes recommendations for office management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| You can have, for instance, the register of the deans or one of those can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| would you do research for us to see how we can become more efficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| You know, he can see what's going on elsewhere, sort of what the baker said it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| And I really look at the inspector general doing things a lot more than just keeping honest people honest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4178)|
| 1:09:45| and maybe catching people who aren't honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| but trying to put new systems in place that makes things run more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| And I won't say anything more about it, but let's get back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| Your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| I was just going to ask, in that appointment, in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| does the county commission, they have the right to fire, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| For cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| For cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| The mayor is getting relieved for any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| I'll let you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| She was asking on the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| I've never answered a question from the love of my life before, but the question is who can fire who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| In the last ordinance, talking about the appointment, anyone that the mayor appoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| A super majority of commission can relieve anyone of their duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| Again, this is another situation where I don't think we would have been through such torture over the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4235)|
| 1:10:42| about folks that, again, just cause is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| There can't be a knee jerk firing necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| but if commission did their due diligence and found that there was just cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| a super majority could remove any of these mayoral appointments with approval of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| with a super majority vote, and that's a very important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| Yes, I just want to know what the definition of just cause was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| Is that going to be delineated out to where you've got A, B, C, D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| I think you would have to ask Mike Arms about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| I'm not sure exactly how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| That has to be determined what just cause is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| Just cause, any employer has to deal with that, the counties and employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| I'm sure lawyers for the county would, I'm guessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| they would be counseled before that consideration was even put forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| I imagine the law director would have to advise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| but that's not something we would put in the ordinance or the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| I've got one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| I'd like to go back to your opening point when you were talking about this review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4310)|
| 1:11:57| Now, I understood you saying whatever they come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| they go directly to the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| Could you repeat what he said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| We're talking about the charter review committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| That whatever is approved by the charter review committee goes straight to the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| versus going to election commission first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| And frankly, sir, I don't know enough about the charter review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| to be able to comment on it, but maybe Dr. Briggs does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| It don't come back to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| I think the other night there were some people who misspoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| and I can't remember if it was me or someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| but after we looked carefully at this, at what the county charter says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| and I'll pull it out for you here in just a second for me to read it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| If it passes the charter review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| it's sent directly to the election commission to be put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4374)|
| 1:13:01| And that would be true if they get their signatures together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| and go to the election commission and go directly to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| It does not go to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| Just a note on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| Those offices we've gone through the last year talking about term limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| that you didn't want career politicians in the register of deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| in the sheriff's office, in the county clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| in the property assessment's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| And, Brad, would this do away with term limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| Could these folks serve as directors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| Under which folks are you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| The register of deeds, the county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| If they were appointed, could they continue to serve more than eight years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| And if so, what was the thought of the term limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| Was there any discussion at all about the term limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| Let's go to the amendment itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| Do you want to know, or do I want to read it to you verbatim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| I don't want to, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4442)|
| 1:14:09| I'm talking about the exact verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| He understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4453)|
| 1:14:26| You were asking, I was not paying attention to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| but you asked how long or what would they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| Could they be appointed longer than eight years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Could they be in there for life where we have term limits now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| Well, is there a term to their appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| The IG is a six-year appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| But he could be, I think he could be reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| And he can be reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| And he can be reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| But is there a term to the register of deeds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| I have to read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| I have to read this because, again, I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| I'm just a citizen volunteer here just trying to get by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| Beginning on September 1, 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| the following executive branch officers of county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| specifically including, and we dropped one of these, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| county trustee, county clerk, property assessor, we dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| Register of deeds, and that's a whole other issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| shall be appointed by the mayor rather than elected in prior years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| Said appointees shall be considered department directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| with job descriptions proposed by the mayor with the advice of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| Said appointments and job descriptions shall be subject to approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| by resolution of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| The mayor, subject to approval by resolution of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| which approval may not be unreasonably withheld,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| may create or abolish other departments of county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| with each department having a department director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| All department directors of the county appointed by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| shall be subject to dismissal by the mayor without cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| and shall be residents of Knox County at the time they assume duties of their office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| and at all other times while serving the county in such capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| Any department director of the county may be removed for cause by commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| upon an affirmative vote of two-thirds or a supermajority of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| Knox County Charter hereby amended to delete the words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| including constitutional officers effective September 1, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| Knox County Charter is hereby amended to delete the phrase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| all constitutional officers and to substitute in lieu thereof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| the phrase all department directors effective September 1, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| Again, beyond this mayor's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| The Knox County Charter is hereby amended to repeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| the section numbers that don't mean anything to this group necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| Oh, but here is the section that is meant to repeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| The law director shall be appointed by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| subject to the advice and approval of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| which approval may not be unreasonably withheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| The law director can be removed by the mayor without cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| and can be removed by commission for fraud or other malfeasance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| upon an affirmative vote of two-thirds of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| It gives a bunch of sections and department titles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4633)|
| 1:17:20| shall be amended to repeal such sections in their entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| I'm not sure exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| Section 4.01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| I'm not sure what that's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| I may have misheard what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| Did you say the mayor could remove him without cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| and the county commission can only remove him for fraud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| The law director is for fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| The law director is for fraud and malfeasance upon an affirmative vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| No other cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| But the mayor could fire him for no cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| He says without cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| When it comes to these particular positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| we're talking about the ones I named to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| excluding property assessor, county trustee, county clerk, register of deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| Say Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| Okay, what concerns me about that, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| is that the trustee is in charge of the banking for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| So if the mayor says I want you to bank with this specific bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| and the trustee says no, he can be removed without cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| That's a real concern, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| A very serious concern because then the mayor could direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| who Knox County does banking with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| And that could be one of his buddies, and that's cronyism, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| and that's what you're trying to eliminate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| as I understood from your numerous speeches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| And I don't see how that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| I don't see how that eliminates cronyism from that equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| I think our next mayor is going to be on pretty good behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| but that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| What's the guarantee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| You know, there are no guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| Can I ask why the property assessor was removed from this list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| Was there a reason for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| What's the logic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| To keep Steve Hunt like from Rat and Bat about you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| Steve what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| To keep Steve Hunt like from Rat and Bat about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| No, I don't think that's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| But Commissioner Ballard made a pretty good case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| obviously with a conflict of interest, made a pretty good case for why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4770)|
| 1:19:36| As I recall, one of his points was something to the effect of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| we need more money in here, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| Why don't you go see what you can do about tweaking the property tax rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| or what have you, or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| And there was a determination, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| this group's been accused of total inflexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| and there was enough folks that came up to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| you might want to reconsider one or more of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| That went with Mr. Ballard's, even with his blatant conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| We decided that he had a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| As far as the person that raises roughly, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| half of the county's budget, something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| frankly needed to be independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| Elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| And one moment here before we, I do have three other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| Commissioner Ballard is in Nashville today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| He's on a mediation in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| He thought he would return in time, but he called a couple hours ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| saying he's going to have to spend the night in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| His mediation was continuing on in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| So he's at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| That leads me into another point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| He said he would be at the Saturday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| Do we have other reviews of this that are taking place Saturday morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4859)|
| 1:21:05| Saturday morning is at the Powell Library across from the Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4865)|
| 1:21:12| Oh, it's 1 to 3 across from the United Methodist Church at Powell Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4872)|
| 1:21:19| Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| And then Monday evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4883)|
| 1:21:29| April 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| So there are at least two of these on the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| And I'm sure there will be others to come as we become more firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| in what's going to take place as far as the Petition Review Committee goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| if that's the avenue that's taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4910)|
| 1:21:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| I want to take at least a couple more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| because I really wanted just to close the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| but I do want to recognize any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| Did I miss it, or did you ever answer if the offices are appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| will they have term limits on them as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| Did I miss the answer to that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| No, they're not specified in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| The person they can serve right now when they're elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| they have, say, two terms they can serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| If they're appointed, they can serve as long as they want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| No, they can serve as long as the mayor wants them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| So as long as they're in good graces, they can serve five or six terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| Well, the mayor can't, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| The mayor's term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| But, I mean, that's the term as long as he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| If they were doing a good job and the new mayor liked them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| they probably could be then reaffirmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| But I need that comment on the sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| You understand how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| My question was going to be if Commissioner Ballard was able to make a good stance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| or a reason for him not being involved in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| will Commissioner, I'm sorry, Commissioner back here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| will her issues, will that be good enough to make the trustee be removed from it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| I don't think that's one we can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| But you see what has happened is that looking at it from Commissioner Ballard's point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5004)|
| 1:23:32| his campaigning for whatever he's, it doesn't matter what he's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5012)|
| 1:23:39| what I was going to say, it does not matter which office he's campaigning for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| He had an idea about that, and he presented his idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| and he has got some acquiescence to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| Just hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| Another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| I'm looking for questions right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| I'm looking for questions right now, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| Brad, has your group talked to the current registered needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| or the county clerk or the county trustee to see if they could give you their idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| of why they should be removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| I'm slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| The answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| I'm going to answer for him and say it's no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| But see, that's the reason, that's the reason I suggested that we have a charter review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5065)|
| 1:24:31| because we can ask those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| Talking about the school board districts, we can bring the school board and let them look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| See, we only had until Monday to decide, and that's pretty short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| And what's the timeframe now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| From the time we had, if the appointments are accepted by the county commission on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5084)|
| 1:24:54| we have about 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| And what we can do now, some of these things they've taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| If we want to, we can put the property assessor back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| We can bring the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| We can let the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| We can let each of them come in and make their arguments to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| Just because they've taken something off, and I'll be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| I think most of the revisions are good because we can put all the ambiguous language back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| I mean, they, you know, and I'm not trying to be critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| They're not running it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| It's going to be the charter review committee with everyone's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| And see, that's why we needed to slow this process down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| Otherwise, we had until Monday to get this whole thing done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| But we didn't have to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| No, we don't have to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| But if there's, I mean, there's, I'll tell you, you know, what it is, is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| and this gets back to the first question that was asked, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| which of these were controversial and which aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| I think most of us agree that the nepotism amendment is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| And, you know, the only thing we find are a few of these that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| there's about three or four of them that I think almost everyone would agree are good amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| Those will go through, I mean, I think those should go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| and those should be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| There's not going to be a whole lot of argument over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| And I'm talking about whether they should be on the ballot or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| There'll be people that will vote for them or against them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| but I'm talking about whether they should be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| But that's why I think we needed the charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| That lets all these people come, and they can have their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| They have their day in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| Well, Dr. Briggs, I heard you speak the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| You were a former military, and you praised the inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| And I agree with that theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| It's just that I think that inspector general's hands are going to be tied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| unless we, the voter, elect him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| You know, this committee asked if we're giving him a right to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| let's vote for that man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| You're saying it's going to be the second most important seat in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| Let me just say, I think, see, this, that's to slow the process down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| and we can kind of make that argument about whether we want to vote on him or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| Or her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| Or her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| Let me say one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| And I'm not for or against any of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| but I think that it's nice to hear something from the other side of some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| And I've had one person suggest that the inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5229)|
| 1:27:17| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| No comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| No comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| It is not the most important thing to remember that the review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5242)|
| 1:27:28| It will be on a ballot that the citizens can vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| The committee is not going to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| It will be the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| They're just going to decide the verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| And I don't think we should be afraid to put something on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| I have faith in the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| See, I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| And there seemed to be a rush to get these on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| but I think there were problems in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| and I think some of the revisions that have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| have made the amendments better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| They have made them clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| And I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| It's not an argument about letting them vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| but I think our responsibility is not to let them vote on a flawed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| And make it real clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| And I really, you know, I was in the Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| You know, the Army has this KISS principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| Keep it simple, stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| And if we're going to vote on whether to reduce the commission from 19 members to 11 members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5294)|
| 1:28:20| let's let us vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| And let's not get arguing over whether it should be partisan or nonpartisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| They've already dropped the nonpartisan issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| Let's not throw the school districts in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| Let's decide on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| Let the people decide on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| They're all talking, so I'll recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| I just want to make sure that everybody understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| that there is already one amendment that's going to be on the ballot already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| and that is the recall amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| And that doesn't have anything to do with any of these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| but there's already an amendment on the ballot that I don't work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| that is going to be on the ballot regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| The county commission has to put on the ballot that allows an elected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5338)|
| 1:29:05| to be recalled, you know, by their vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| I'm going to make one statement here real quick on behalf of Dave and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| because we're both running for office in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| is don't confuse the fact that we voted to put these things forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| so that we're for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| And I've tried to be very careful at this point not to say which ones I'm for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| or which ones I'm against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| And if you want me to, I'll give you arguments both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| After those amendments are there, then I'll start the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| But I really want to be an honest person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| I want to be fair to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| And my main concern is that we don't put legally flawed amendments on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5377)|
| 1:29:43| that will cause unintended consequences that will be very difficult to undo later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| And that's what my goal is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5387)|
| 1:29:53| The question that I asked was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| does the inspector general have to be a current resident of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5398)|
| 1:30:07| No, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| I asked that question and I don't want an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5410)|
| 1:30:17| I don't want an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| He doesn't want an answer from that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| No, I don't want an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| But does that let you see what we're dealing with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| It's a lot of what ifs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| And there's no need for the 1% on one side and the 1% on the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| to try to convince each other to change their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| The thing that we're trying to do is to get questions from citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| so that they may be better informed about what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| that the charter petition committee wanted to suggest to the voters of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5448)|
| 1:30:58| And how they get there, whether they come through commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| or whether they go directly to the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| or whether it's through a charter review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| doesn't really make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| I think he said the last word that will be had on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| is going to be at the ballot box by the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| I mean, that's the last word on any of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| is that it's what 90,000 people want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| whether they want this particular thing changed or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| and these four or five or these none at all, none at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| And then we don't know whether they even get to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| You know, you have to push them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| Commission has to take them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| The committee has to take them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| Yes, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5504)|
| 1:31:45| I asked Brad a question last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| I don't know if you had time to talk to anybody about the federal census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| Probably you won't do the redistricting until after the election of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| And I asked you last night, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| what if you have commissioners that run for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| and the lines get drawn where you draw them together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| Then someone's going to have to leave office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| and someone's going to have to be appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| in a district with no representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| And that's a good way of the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| It's just like my question that you have to be a resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| if you're the inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| Does the charter review committee have access to, like, the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| Every member of the public can be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| And the law director will probably be the one that does the verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| So he'll have to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| Do we have other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| I want to go back to Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| I read something a long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| I understand you say the mayor could fire the law director without comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5568)|
| 1:32:55| Is this correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| I believe I did say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| David, could you repeat what Mr. Gray said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| That the law director could be fired by the mayor without cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| Sir, there was a continuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| Is that in the charter already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| No, we're just saying you've asked a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| Now you understand where that one, in your opinion, can be flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5597)|
| 1:33:25| Do I see other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| Can you tell people what to do with their forms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| We would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| Can you take up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| Who would take up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Who's going to collect forms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| I'm taking up the forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| The forms are being collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| You don't have to have it complete right this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| Forms to be collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| You don't have yours completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| You just leave it at the back when you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| Again, I'd like to thank Don and Pat for working with us tonight on the refreshments and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5634)|
| 1:34:03| Again, Mr. Joe Longmire for making sure that we had lights and water and all that sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| And for whoever fixed the fire alarm, I like that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5648)|
| 1:34:13| What do you have to say here to us in closing since it's your presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5653)|
| 1:34:20| I like to think of it as our presentation or our feedback session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| And in closing, you know, when Dr. Briggs initiated with this Charter Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5664)|
| 1:34:33| I think with our committee there was a sigh of relief on two fronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5673)|
| 1:34:40| About that same day we found out about Dr. Briggs' initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| the county commission passed unanimously to create this review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| We also found out that whatever effort we put forth, whatever petition drive we put forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| at least the latest word is, which it seems these things can change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| but the word from the state election commission is that the November ballot is an option for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| as a backstop for any amendments that go to a petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5704)|
| 1:35:13| Our wish, our hope, our hope is that this Charter Review Committee takes these amendments into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5713)|
| 1:35:21| takes other taxpayer ideas into consideration, that all of this is vetted properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5721)|
| 1:35:28| and that the language is acceptable to the law, to the taxpayers, to the voters, to the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5728)|
| 1:35:34| and they just have a chance to vote on whatever this review committee puts forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| and then there's no petition drive. That is the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| But again, letting the people vote, it's been coined a cliche,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| but really that is the theme of what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| I'm going to make a final comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| I think this is, including the workshop that we had that went several hours down at the city county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5754)|
| 1:36:01| I've been to all of these except for one, I think this was the best director we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| It's the first one, including the workshop where we went through every one of the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| and I think we need to thank Dave Wright for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5770)|
| 1:36:17| And I really appreciate everyone being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| Remember there are a couple of others of these already on the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| Attend them if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| Now, if you have any questions of me or would like to make a comment to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| I'll be here for one-on-one until they turn out the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080320?start=5788)|
