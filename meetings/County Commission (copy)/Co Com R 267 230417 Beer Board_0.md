| 0:07:31| Valiant, who's requested permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=451.02)|

| 0:07:39| because he has to leave for another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=459.02)|
| 0:07:43| Do I see any objection to anyone on the board here to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=463.02)|
| 0:07:48| and move that to the next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=468.02)|
| 0:07:53| Seeing no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=473.02)|
| 0:07:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=474.02)|
| 0:07:55| If you'd like to come forward on that, would you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=475.02)|
| 0:07:57| clerk, would you read Item 6, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=477.02)|
| 0:08:00| It's El Tequila Bar and Grill, 7002 Manorville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=480.02)|
| 0:08:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=488.02)|
| 0:08:09| Director Book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=489.02)|
| 0:08:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=490.02)|
| 0:08:17| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=497.02)|
| 0:08:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=498.02)|
| 0:08:22| He's there, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=502.02)|
| 0:08:23| Well, with my confident co-counsel, Brother Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=503.02)|
| 0:08:27| Give us your name and address first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=507.02)|
| 0:08:32| I've never done this before, but I do have a doctor's appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=512.02)|
| 0:08:37| This is a report back on a non-minor sale violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=517.02)|
| 0:08:44| and Mr. Jones has just come on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=524.02)|
| 0:08:48| so there's been two meetings with regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=528.02)|
| 0:08:51| And at the last meeting, the beer board suspended the license pending a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=531.02)|
| 0:08:58| coming back and you all reporting back to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=538.02)|
| 0:09:01| and that's what we're here on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=541.02)|
| 0:09:03| So anything that you want to present to the board, just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=543.02)|
| 0:09:09| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=549.02)|
| 0:09:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=550.02)|
| 0:09:11| Relative to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=551.02)|
| 0:09:12| I did have an opportunity to discuss the matter with the representative from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=552.02)|
| 0:09:17| the Sheriff's Department, Mr. Walker, relative to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=557.02)|
| 0:09:20| And I was able to confirm, albeit, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=560.02)|
| 0:09:23| we wished it was an entirely perfect record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=563.02)|
| 0:09:26| there have been no new citations issued on the premise with regards to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=566.02)|
| 0:09:32| conduct of the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=572.02)|
| 0:09:33| I do have the representatives of the bar here and I do apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=573.02)|
| 0:09:37| I was actually asking them a question during the period of time that you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=577.02)|
| 0:09:40| sharing witnesses, swearing witnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=580.02)|
| 0:09:43| but I don't think it would be necessary really to hear from them other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=583.02)|
| 0:09:46| just an affirmation of what your own officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=586.02)|
| 0:09:50| I believe will affirm with regards to the fact that there have been no new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=590.02)|
| 0:09:53| citations and that the bar is striving to do its best to conform to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=593.02)|
| 0:10:00| requirements of the law in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=600.02)|
| 0:10:03| and particularly Knox County with the dispensation of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=603.02)|
| 0:10:06| As the board will recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=606.02)|
| 0:10:09| the board suspended effectively on the motion of Commissioner Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=609.02)|
| 0:10:14| the beer permit for a period of 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=614.02)|
| 0:10:17| They have maintained their ability to sell alcohol with the ABC permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=617.02)|
| 0:10:21| through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=621.02)|
| 0:10:22| So I think if we'd had issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=622.02)|
| 0:10:24| we would have seen them particularly with regards to things that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=624.02)|
| 0:10:29| troubling and that would be obviously something that is the death nail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=629.02)|
| 0:10:32| would have been underage sales, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=632.02)|
| 0:10:34| So that being said, at least from a report standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=634.02)|
| 0:10:37| I think we're as good, albeit we're aspiring to be better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=637.02)|
| 0:10:41| sort of like the Sears, good, better, and best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=641.02)|
| 0:10:43| So obviously we can always do better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=643.02)|
| 0:10:46| but I think the lack of citation speaks volumes is the fact that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=646.02)|
| 0:10:50| business is making strides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=650.02)|
| 0:10:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=652.02)|
| 0:10:54| I pulled the 911 reports for the 60 day period from the last beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=654.02)|
| 0:10:59| There had been eight calls for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=659.02)|
| 0:11:02| Three of those were repeat calls on a stolen car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=662.02)|
| 0:11:04| One had been stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=664.02)|
| 0:11:06| Another one had been chased and another one had been recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=666.02)|
| 0:11:09| That was stolen from a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=669.02)|
| 0:11:11| There was three loud music complaints that the officers responded to and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=671.02)|
| 0:11:14| told them to turn down the music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=674.02)|
| 0:11:16| And I think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=676.02)|
| 0:11:19| And then there were two arrests made in the parking lot of patrons that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=679.02)|
| 0:11:22| stated that they had been in El Tequila that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=682.02)|
| 0:11:25| and one of them being a 16-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=685.02)|
| 0:11:27| They were doing burnouts in the parking lot, and I have the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=687.02)|
| 0:11:30| And also there's body camera footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=690.02)|
| 0:11:32| video of the interview that the officer is doing with the two people in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=692.02)|

| 0:11:38| I also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=698.02)|
| 0:11:40| Commissioner Lee tracked down the rape incident report that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=700.02)|
| 0:11:45| November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=705.02)|
| 0:11:46| or I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=706.02)|
| 0:11:47| December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=707.02)|
| 0:11:48| The officer did go to the bar to request a video surveillance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=708.02)|
| 0:11:51| So the owner was aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=711.02)|
| 0:11:53| Obviously that the detective went and did ask for the video surveillance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=713.02)|
| 0:11:56| from the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=716.02)|
| 0:11:57| He was told that because it had taken place prior to their video races,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=717.02)|
| 0:12:01| apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=721.02)|
| 0:12:02| That there was no available video of the incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=722.02)|
| 0:12:04| Now in full disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=724.02)|
| 0:12:06| the victim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=726.02)|
| 0:12:07| a 16-year-old woman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=727.02)|
| 0:12:09| was a 16-year-old woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=729.02)|
| 0:12:11| Now in full disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=731.02)|
| 0:12:12| the victim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=732.02)|
| 0:12:13| a 16-year-old stated she had been in a bar listening to a concert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=733.02)|
| 0:12:17| was drunk and was in the parking lot and was raped by her account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=737.02)|
| 0:12:22| Because she waited almost a month to report it and came with her mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=742.02)|
| 0:12:27| There was no physical evidence to obtain any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=747.02)|
| 0:12:30| any kind of a charge at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=750.02)|
| 0:12:32| And no video of her actually being in the bar was available is what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=752.02)|
| 0:12:37| detective was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=757.02)|
| 0:12:38| And the case went no further than that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=758.02)|
| 0:12:46| Could I make just an inquiry of Lieutenant Walker just to follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=766.02)|
| 0:12:50| based upon some discussions that we had earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=770.02)|
| 0:12:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=772.02)|
| 0:12:53| Lieutenant Walker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=773.02)|
| 0:12:54| particularly relative to the allegation of the alleged sexual assault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=774.02)|
| 0:12:57| relative to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=777.02)|
| 0:12:58| that allegation doesn't come up until 30 days afterwards, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=778.02)|
| 0:13:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=782.02)|
| 0:13:03| And all we have is a cursory allegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=783.02)|
| 0:13:05| no information substantively that actually puts her underage consuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=785.02)|
| 0:13:10| alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=790.02)|
| 0:13:11| other than her naked statement made 30 days after the fact with her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=791.02)|
| 0:13:15| mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=795.02)|
| 0:13:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=796.02)|
| 0:13:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=797.02)|
| 0:13:18| And the same thing goes with regards to the individuals alleged to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=798.02)|
| 0:13:21| been doing burnouts in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=801.02)|
| 0:13:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=803.02)|
| 0:13:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=804.02)|
| 0:13:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=805.02)|
| 0:13:26| And that parking lot actually services other businesses besides El Tequila,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=806.02)|
| 0:13:29| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=809.02)|
| 0:13:30| Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=810.02)|
| 0:13:31| but none of them were open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=811.02)|
| 0:13:32| Right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=812.02)|
| 0:13:33| right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=813.02)|
| 0:13:34| So the public parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=814.02)|
| 0:13:35| it's open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=815.02)|
| 0:13:36| if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=816.02)|
| 0:13:37| to the public at large and relative to these individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=817.02)|
| 0:13:40| that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=820.02)|
| 0:13:41| as far as any actual indication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=821.02)|
| 0:13:44| if you were able to establish that they had been served under age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=824.02)|
| 0:13:47| we'd seen citations issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=827.02)|
| 0:13:48| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=828.02)|
| 0:13:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=829.02)|
| 0:13:50| They didn't come in contact with police until after apparently they'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=830.02)|
| 0:13:52| left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=832.02)|
| 0:13:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=833.02)|
| 0:13:54| And my representation earlier relative to citations with regards to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=834.02)|
| 0:13:57| that was accurate based upon my information and conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=837.02)|
| 0:14:02| The bar itself has not been cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=842.02)|
| 0:14:04| I just didn't want it to be that I appear disingenuous with regards to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=844.02)|
| 0:14:08| representations associated with the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=848.02)|
| 0:14:10| And finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=850.02)|
| 0:14:11| addressing the first of the complaints that you indicated relative to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=851.02)|
| 0:14:15| stolen vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=855.02)|
| 0:14:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=856.02)|
| 0:14:17| And in fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=857.02)|
| 0:14:18| with your number of years and your stature in law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=858.02)|
| 0:14:20| that's just as likely to have occurred at West town mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=860.02)|
| 0:14:24| Is it a car date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=864.02)|
| 0:14:25| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=865.02)|
| 0:14:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=866.02)|
| 0:14:27| There's no nexus between the bar and a vehicle being stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=867.02)|
| 0:14:30| Just other than the address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=870.02)|
| 0:14:31| it was reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=871.02)|
| 0:14:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=872.02)|
| 0:14:33| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=873.02)|
| 0:14:34| and then as to loud music,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=874.02)|
| 0:14:35| that's just simply anytime that there's a call for service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=875.02)|
| 0:14:38| music's too loud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=878.02)|
| 0:14:39| be it an abutting property or something of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=879.02)|
| 0:14:42| then law enforcement's going to come and they're going to do exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=882.02)|
| 0:14:45| Turn down the music,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=885.02)|
| 0:14:46| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=886.02)|
| 0:14:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=887.02)|
| 0:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=888.02)|
| 0:14:49| No citations were issued as to loud music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=889.02)|
| 0:14:50| No,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=890.02)|
| 0:14:51| nothing further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=891.02)|
| 0:14:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=892.02)|

| 0:17:11| we requested to conduct a food audit at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1031.02)|

| 0:17:32| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1052.02)|

| 0:17:37| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1057.02)|
| 0:17:38| they were not under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1058.02)|

| 0:17:44| we corrected that problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1064.02)|

| 0:18:00| it took over a month for us to get that documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1080.02)|
| 0:18:02| At that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1082.02)|
| 0:18:03| we were directed by our legal counsel to issue a citation for failure to cooperate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1083.02)|
| 0:18:08| regarding an investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1088.02)|
| 0:18:10| which was a $1,500 citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1090.02)|
| 0:18:13| Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1093.02)|
| 0:18:14| once the food audit was conducted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1094.02)|
| 0:18:15| right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1095.02)|

| 0:18:19| which is a limited service license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1099.02)|
| 0:18:22| which is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1102.02)|

| 0:18:28| as of right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1108.02)|

| 0:19:44| unless further action is taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1184.02)|
| 0:19:46| when that 60 days is up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1186.02)|

| 0:20:45| and their license should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1245.02)|

| 0:23:24| this establishment is a danger to the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1404.02)|

| 0:23:31| so that we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1411.02)|
| 0:23:33| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1413.02)|

| 0:23:53| obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1433.02)|
| 0:23:54| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1434.02)|
| 0:23:55| when folks are rowdy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1435.02)|
| 0:23:56| in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1436.02)|
| 0:23:57| dealing with it immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1437.02)|
| 0:23:58| quieting it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1438.02)|
| 0:23:59| addressing those concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1439.02)|

| 0:24:01| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1441.02)|
| 0:24:02| obviously there's some chagrin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1442.02)|
| 0:24:03| with regards to the fact that the music got too loud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1443.02)|
| 0:24:05| on a couple of occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1445.02)|
| 0:24:06| But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1446.02)|
| 0:24:07| at least as far as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1447.02)|
| 0:24:08| trying to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1448.02)|
| 0:24:09| on a day-by-day basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1449.02)|
| 0:24:11| they've been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1451.02)|
| 0:24:12| They have been serving alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1452.02)|
| 0:24:14| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1454.02)|
| 0:24:15| because of the fact that they have their ABC license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1455.02)|
| 0:24:17| and that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1457.02)|
| 0:24:18| I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1458.02)|

| 0:24:21| Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1461.02)|
| 0:24:22| that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1462.02)|
| 0:24:23| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1463.02)|
| 0:24:24| I think we all took basic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1464.02)|
| 0:24:25| basic science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1465.02)|
| 0:24:26| and so we understand the circumstances associated with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1466.02)|
| 0:24:28| and get just as drunk on one as the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1468.02)|
| 0:24:30| That being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1470.02)|
| 0:24:31| that is not acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1471.02)|
| 0:24:32| with regards to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1472.02)|

| 0:24:40| by God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1480.02)|

| 0:24:42| we all cruised downtown west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1482.02)|
| 0:24:43| That's where everybody went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1483.02)|
| 0:24:44| and there wasn't nothing else open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1484.02)|
| 0:24:45| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1485.02)|

| 0:24:50| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1490.02)|
| 0:24:51| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1491.02)|
| 0:24:52| whether that's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1492.02)|
| 0:24:53| wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=1493.02)|
