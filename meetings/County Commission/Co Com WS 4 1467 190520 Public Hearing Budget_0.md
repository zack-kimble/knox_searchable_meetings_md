| 0:01:51| I'm here on behalf of the Knox County Rescue Budget Workshop to talk a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=111)|
| 0:01:57| I have put together a quick slide show, if you could go ahead and open that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| just to give you a little bit of history about the rescue squad and kind of where we came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| what we've always done, and where we've been, and how we can continue to serve Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=128)|
| 0:02:15| Started in 1956, serving a need by these gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| Can you open the slide up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=140)|

| 0:03:17| Okay, it's not on the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| All right, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| You got it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Most of you probably know who we are, but I'm not sure if all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| I haven't had an opportunity to speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| I'm the Deputy Chief of Operations, so this relates to budget, which relates to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| which means capital and projected amounts of things that I can replace that help serve Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=212)|
| 0:03:41| rescue items, tools, helmets, safety equipment, boats, life jackets, and all of the above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=221)|
| 0:03:49| So I thought it was appropriate that I come and during the workshop and take an opportunity to speak to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| go over a recent history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| I think we're the second longest serving emergency service in Knox County behind the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| We've been here 61 years and provided lots and lots of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| and so I thought I'd take an opportunity to kind of give you a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| You can go ahead and change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| Kind of where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| You can change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| And our mission has never changed, and that's to render aid to persons in distress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| administer field first aid, and technical rescue services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=266)|
| 0:04:35| Back up one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| Okay, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| In 2018 alone, we responded to a total of 19,058 emergency calls for service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=282)|
| 0:04:49| roughly right around 2,000 calls for service that we respond to annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| Those come through the 911 center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| We respond along with our other emergency service partners, which would be rural metro fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| Corns fire, Seymour fire, all your other emergency service providers in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| 1,482 of those were motor vehicle accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| We respond to those more so than anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| providing technical rescue services in addition with the fire service response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| In a lot of areas, we are the primary rescue service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| and have been deemed the primary rescue service in the majority of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| You all spoke earlier in February, and I was here when we talked about the floods and the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| We, as an agency, responded to 47 water rescues, flood rescues in 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=338)|
| 0:05:48| That was accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| We did have one drowning death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| A little bit of history behind that, we had a diver on the scene very rapidly that dove in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=352)|
| 0:06:00| and gave that man a chance at life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| And you cannot put a price on that, and it's an amazing feat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| I know it was talked about a little bit, but to have that gentleman pull up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| he was a volunteer to be able to respond, be equipped, and trained to provide that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| And that fast amount of time is amazing, much less being able to handle these calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| And if you realize, we serve all of Knox County, just not one commission district, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| So we serve all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| And these were spread out northeast, southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| We responded to every single one of them in a timely fashion, and were successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| Nope, that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| You went past one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| Dive rescue I talked a little bit about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| You can go ahead and hit the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| We are the only agency that does do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| Storm and flood and swift water rescue we talked a little bit about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| What that picture of in the slide just to give you some idea, that's us in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| We did respond with the city and also the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| another emergency service partner that we work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| That's us deploying with the city back a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| Trench rescues, the only service provider that you have in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| is this level of technical rescue expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| And they've been doing it a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| We've shot videos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| We're nationally recognized for being able to do these types of calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| We saw it early and got equipped and were able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| Where we're at now with these types of calls is equipment replacement because the stuff's getting older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| I started in 1987.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| A lot of this equipment is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| That's roughly 31 years of service to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| Some of this equipment is in dire need of replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| It's not something I can handle in a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| It's something I have to handle in a capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| Structural collapse, again, the only agency that is prepared, equipped to immobilize and train to provide this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=483)|
| 0:08:13| The picture on the left is in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| I can't remember the one on the right or on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| In Corns, if you remember back several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| that's our rescue technicians down in there driving that along with the Corns Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| Cave rescue, believe it or not, there are a lot of caves in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| and probably Public Works could agree with me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| Sometimes we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| We do have a federally qualified cave rescue team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| There's roughly 7,000 caves within an hour and a half of here that we respond to regionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| as well as serving Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| Rope rescues, we do get into with the rock quarries and some of the rock climbing areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| Search, building search mainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| We work with the Knox County Sheriff's Office on searches, ground searches for lost people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| but we also provide a USAR element to building collapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| Heavy rescues, most of these are fairly recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Heavy rescues meaning vehicles greater than 26,000 pounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| and you know we have a lot of them rolling through Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| Dump trucks, concrete trucks, tractor trailers, a lot of interstate traffic that we respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| Again, the only agency really equipped to be able to handle these types of emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| Animal rescues, you don't think you need to prepare for it until no one shows up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| and they expect you to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| They expect you to be equipped, and they expect you to take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| Times have changed a little bit, and so we respond to these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| That's a horse, a cat, a dog in a cave probably got more Facebook hits for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| than anything other rescues of humans that we've had in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| So this shows you I'm trying to learn as we go with some of this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| Some of the technical rescues you've probably seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| These are just some examples of it just to give you some idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| I don't know how much you know about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| It went past one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| Oh, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| Confined space rescue, again, it's a federal OSHA requirement that any business that has a confined space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| has a designated confined space rescue team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| By federal law, they have to have one, or they can have their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| We do provide that, which does affect business and growth in Knox County to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| It requires annual training, certification, equipment, very expensive equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| We still do some fire scene standbys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| We do respond to structure fires now with some agreements that we have in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| and we will go wherever is requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Some of that has happened from the fact that some structure fires have trapped firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=666)|
| 0:11:14| and so now they would like an additional company, a rescue truck there to provide some additional equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=674)|
| 0:11:21| should that happen, which is probably a smart thing on the fire chief's side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| Again, we are an essential service, and our Knox County designated rescue service provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| I think somebody already went over these numbers, but they're still good to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| We provide to everybody in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| So right now, budget-wise, what we're seeing are these numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| and it's going to really be hard for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| and we're going to struggle to maintain the level of service that you're used to receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| because a lot of equipment, a lot of different capital projects that we need to be able to complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| we can't do with that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| You know, we go through the RFI process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| We are a United Way agency, a vetted United Way agency, and we try to generate more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| We turn in our paperwork, and we hope that we get funded to the level that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| so that we can produce some of these capital projects that need to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| because ultimately we're not going to get a pay raise, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| We're going to get equipment to serve you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| This truck that you see, I took a picture of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| That's one of the trucks serving Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| I have three of those on duty, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| I just talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| There's no other emergency agency in Knox County that can provide the range and level of technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| emergency rescue services that we provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| Do we depend on our other emergency service partners to supplement that manpower and that personnel issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Everybody works together in Knox County, all the fire departments, all the emergency services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| the medic units, the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| But we bring the people that know how to operate that equipment, that have had years of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| and training, technical expertise that you just can't make happen overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| We have to have them, and we have to have the equipment to serve Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| We think that we serve you all in a vital capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| And if you're that person stuck in one of those many, many pictures, you'll agree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| And a lot of people we've served, I think you all know that we need to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| I know there's some other information out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| You can go ahead and hit next slide, on where the county is going forward with its emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| And I think that's a valid discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| I know we are a part of a separate funding study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| But right now for the foreseeable future, we need funding now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| For the next foreseeable future, we have to have it in order to maintain the level of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| that you all provide for operational liability on our parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| and safety of our members to provide the personal protection equipment that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=861)|
| 0:14:29| We can't grow as an agency if we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=871)|
| 0:14:39| Just keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Yeah, it's supposed to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| So what this does is it goes all the way to the end, and it's a lot of pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| And we have a lot because we have a long history of service and sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| that a lot of our members have made for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| And that's what we're asking for is for you to look at RFI, look at our defined services contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| what we've asked for, look at some of the requests for capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| I'll be happy to send those to you via email, and you can take a look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| I don't think they're out of line at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| I think it's where we need to be to be able to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| until we can decide where we want to go as a county going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| Like I said, you all depend on us, and we depend on you for your financial support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| And I'll be happy to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Yeah, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| A few, four or five years ago, we started increasing your all's budget significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| And in that commitment, there was the need for hiring personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| and having people hired on at the rescue squad and capital and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| How many employees do you all have today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| And so how do you man trucks 24-7, 365?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| So we have a staffing agreement with Rural Metro Fire Department to help staff our trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| And so Rural Metro's providing all the personnel service for the trucks 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| And does Rural Metro bill on a fire scene standby for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| Does that count under $1,200 or $1,500 an hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| So you have two employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| So what's your personnel budget number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| What does it cost you all personnel-wise to have those two employees on staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| I'd have to look at the RF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| It's in the RFI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| If you want me to pull it up, I can show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| Yeah, if you could send it to us, I'd like to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Yeah, it's all in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Because we went from funding at $100,000, $125,000, now we're up to around $450,000, $550,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| And we were told we were going to get, you know, part of that was to hire more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| because, I mean, the days of volunteerism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| We did, but that was done, and then that money pretty much ran out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| That was for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| That money was for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| It's every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| And so for the day of volunteerism in a city or a county our size, it's kind of over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| I mean, you've got to pay the pauper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| And so how many employees did you all bring on that one year that you hired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Three employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| And at $500,000, or $450,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| That was for a total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| That was not for three employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| What percentage of you all's budget comes from Knox County government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| Roughly right around $441,000 from the city and about $90,000 from United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| So we're about 80-something percent of your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Eighty-five percent of your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| If you'll send me those dollars, I'd like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| What was the numbers again on the funding number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| I mean, percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| They're roughly around $425,000 from the county, $41,000 from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| and about $90,000 from United Way, $96,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| I have to pull all the numbers up to exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| But I'll send it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| It's all in the narrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Chris, did we not send them more than $440,000 last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| The original budget is $425,000, and we did a designation of $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| We got to $550,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| If you'll send us those documents, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Oh, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| You say that you go to surrounding counties to do rescues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| Do you charge them to go to do that rescue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Or is Knox County funding the surrounding counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| If you want to look at it that way, sir, we have miscellaneous requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| That's the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| It's not the way to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| It's the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| We're funding these other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| They're relying on the Knoxville Rescue Squad to come save somebody out of a cave or dive or whatever like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1125)|
| 0:18:53| But we don't charge them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Have they ever volunteered to donate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| That frequency is very small in number, so we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| We consider that part of the association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| If we needed help in Knox County and we had to call for help, that we would get it without being charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| So you say you've only got two employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Those two employees is your only paid employees, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| Well, actually, two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| We have one that's kind of stopping part-time, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| Are you getting funding from the federal government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| Do you go for grants, matching grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| We do try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| We were fairly successful back in the 2000 year, 2001, when there were a lot of federal grants out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| but it's very hard for us because we're not a fire service to qualify for a lot of those grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| but we do apply for some, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| So Chris said Knox County gave you $525,000 with the extra, or $550,000, right, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1189)|
| 0:19:57| It was $425,000 in the budget, which is the same in 20 as it was in 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| Then last year we did a designation of $125,000 that got it to $550,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| And what are we asking for in this budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| The request was $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| The proposal is the same at $425,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| At $425,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| And then maybe the funds may be there later to give them some more later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| We don't know that until that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| That's a huge jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| You showed the number $430,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| We'll go with the $430,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| $425,000, yeah, roughly right around that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Well, your numbers add up to way over amount that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| You know, if it's United Way, it was $9 million or $90 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| I think $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| And then the city of Knoxville was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| $415,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| $415,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Yes, $41,000, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| So last year you're closer to $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| Total budget, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Okay, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| Do you have a general breakdown or an understanding of how many calls you backed up or went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1272)|
| 0:21:19| that were rural metro and Knox County related to, I'm assuming you back up the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| Fire Department as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| At times we have mutual agreements with the city of Knoxville if they need us to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| Do you know what that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| I don't have it in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| I mean, could you ballpark it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Is it 90-10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Is it 50-50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Oh, it's 90-10 I would say now, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| So 90% of your calls are outside of the city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| Outside the corporate city limits, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| What is the overall budget of the agency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| Right at $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| If you include the additional dollar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| Okay, so there's no other, those are the only three funding sources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| Have you ever asked any other counties for funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| Have you ever sought any other funding resource whatsoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| I mean, we always are looking for other resources as far as funding goes, but as far as sustained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| budget funding, we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| And that includes rural metro providing a majority of your staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| So what would happen if your rural metro said, sorry, we're not in the staffing business for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| We would struggle with volunteers to be able to provide service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| Have you ever asked rural metro to bring you under their wings since they're doing 99% of the share already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| Well, they're doing 99% of the staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Well, staffing is everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| If you don't have staff, you don't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| So have you ever had that conversation with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS41467190520PublicHearingBudget?start=1358)|
