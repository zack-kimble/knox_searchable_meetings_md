| 0:30:10| providing for the issuance of not to exceed $25 million and no dollars of wastewater system revenue bonds, Series 2017B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1810)|

| 0:30:21| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Yes, we've got I guess four of these. We've got the wastewater, the water, the gas and the electric bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| There's about $100 million worth of bonds being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| It would be great if Mark could come up and just hit the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1833)|

| 0:30:46| Mark Walker, 8528 Cambridge Woods Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| Council, there are four resolutions, as has been pointed out on the agenda tonight, for KUB revenue bonds and basically $97 million in total spread across all four utility systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1852)|
| 0:31:03| The purpose of those bonds is to help fund our utility system infrastructure improvements for all four systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| As you may know, it is called our Century 2 Infrastructure Program, which are long-term asset management programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| Essentially, the purpose of these bonds is to continue the funding of those programs and help it for the fiscal year 2018 budget for KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1876)|
| 0:31:24| Mark, just one or two other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Number one, these are revenue bonds and the payback only comes from your KUB revenues, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1886)|
| 0:31:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| The bonds stipulate that they are secured solely by the system revenues of each of the four utility systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| which, in other words, means that KUB is the only one on the hook for the repayment of the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| The city has no obligation whatsoever for repayment of the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| That's the second part that I thought was really important. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| I guess the last thing is, based on the numbers in this set of paperwork we got, you've already got a billion dollars plus of outstanding bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1912)|
| 0:32:02| Does there come a time when you have trouble issuing bonds with that kind of debt load?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1922)|
| 0:32:09| Well, I think each of the four utility systems still has what I would consider a manageable debt profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| We have long-term financial plans for each of our four utility systems that goes out ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| and basically provides for the repayment of the bonds over that period of time, at least a portion of those bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| still showing a very healthy financial condition for all four systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| I think in part evidence of that is that our bond ratings from Moody's and Standard & Poor's are very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| We have a triple A rating on our water system from Standard & Poor's, which is the highest rating available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| and a double A one from Moody's, which is the second highest rating available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| Wastewater is primarily the division that has the most of the debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| has about $500 million for about half of the outstanding debt in and of itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| and that's really related to having a significant amount of capital investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| required under the federal consent decree for the wastewater system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| EPA got after the city and KUB on that one years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| Yes, back in 2004, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| And we are improving our system by using these proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| The system has improved dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| One of the ways we look at it for the wastewater system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| the sanitary sewer overflows was one of the primary reasons for the consent decree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| The level of those overflows has dropped precipitously over the last decade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| and in fact has declined 83% over that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| Thank you very much for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2012)|

| 0:36:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| The motion passes 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| 11K is the resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute a professional services agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| with Environmental Consulting and Testing LLC to provide for administration and abatement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| services for the proper abatement of the existing asbestos-containing curtain at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| Knoxville Civic Auditorium in an amount not to exceed $26,836.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| Moved for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Mayor Bogerts here, and I know I asked her privately, but I was surprised that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| to hire a professional abatement group to what looks like you lower the curtain, put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| it in the bag, and take it down to the special landfill that asbestos things go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| But it's more complicated than that, and maybe you can give us just a nickel's worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| of why we're hiring Environmental Consulting and Testing to oversee this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| We could bury it in your backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Yeah, but they have to take it down or watch them take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| I think you just explained it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| Mary Bogert, 2112 Chesley Boulevard, Merrill, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| So, you know, like with anything, there are codes and safety issues, in particular, Tosha,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| when you're handling asbestos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| And so we have to hire a professional company that is properly trained and has appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| gear to come in and take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| It is a very large curtain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| It covers the entire entrance of the stage, the prosthetium of the stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| It has to be taken down in sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| It's spring-loaded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| It doesn't just lower on a pull rope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| It has a, you know, it's intended to come down very quickly to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| It's an emergency drop thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Yes, to contain a fire or an explosion in the stage house from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| And so, as such, we have to have a professional company to come in and take that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| It comes down in sections as we are moved in sections because it is so large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| and abated by a professional company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| But it's what you got to do, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| Absolutely, part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2300)|

| 0:39:07| Councilman Donald, vote for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Yeah, I guess, is Chad there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| I don't see Chad, but maybe someone...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| David's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| David's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| Oh, back in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| All right, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Thanks, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| You can't get away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| As I read this, these are only, what, lead-based batteries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| not the things, the alkali batteries that we all collect in our houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| What are we supposed to do with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Do they get recycled somehow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| You ain't supposed to put them in your trash, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| David Bryce, City Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| And you're starting to ask me questions I don't have an answer for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| but I believe your average battery at home can be thrown into the garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| These are for lead-acid batteries that, you know, think of a boat battery or a car battery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| And so there's a company that takes those, that salvages the lead out of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| and can recycle those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| It generates, I think, about $750 a year in revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| so it's a revenue-plus contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| It's a moneymaker at the HHW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| But it is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| It's at our Household Hazardous Waste Facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| and it's where our citizens can bring pesticides and other household waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| car batteries, et cetera, that they get recycled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| or sent to the proper disposal location than being put into the garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| To your best knowledge, the alkali and those type of batteries and ICADs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| you just put them in the garbage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| In the garbage can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| 11N is resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an amendment to Agreement C-06-0058| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2435)|
| 0:40:43| with the Public Building Authority to add the Riverwalk Parking Garage and Parking Lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| located at 2011 K Street to the list of parking garages that PBA manages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| operates, and maintains on behalf of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| Councilman Dallavope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| I don't know if Dawn Michele is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| She is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| My only question on this is we have PBA do a lot of management of facilities for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| Why does it cost almost a half a million dollars to manage that garage across the river?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| I mean, it seems like a lot of money for the first year unless they're doing the construction work, too, out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| I mean, don't we have a few ticket takers and, you know, the night watchman or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| What's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| We'll refer to Christy Branscombe on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2486)|
| 0:41:34| Your microphone doesn't appear to be working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Jane Burrett will go over the services that are provided for the fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| but they do manage all of our garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| and there's a lot involved in security and cleanliness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| and making sure that things are functioning and operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| but I'll let Jane explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Jane Burrett, Public Billing Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| My home address is 720 Bricksworth Boulevard, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| In managing all of the parking garages and lots that are publicly owned with the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| we're able to use the same type of equipment, revenue management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| and we have in-house parking management today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| that we can try and reduce costs by using our own people in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| I may be confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| I thought this was $460,000 for the one garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| Is this the whole shoot and match?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| We don't know the full details of the budget at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| but we will be managing it however outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| I know that there was lighting mentioned and cameras possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| So there might be some re-outfitting in that first year of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| Probably the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| Yeah, I'm sure there will be in the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| I'm sure we'll have a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| It'll be front-loaded in the beginning just to get a little more of the appropriate infrastructure in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| to manage the garage correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| and then it will evolve to a regular management contract like we have with our other garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| Okay, so it's kind of rehab and run for the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| Right, and in fact we're meeting tomorrow morning to go over a lot of those details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| What about Southeastern Construction or whatever their name is these days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| Don't they have some responsibility for the cost of that garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| They are sharing in those costs of managing the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| because that garage, if you guys recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| is going to be shared and used by their multifamily tenants and also Regal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| and then also have availability for public parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2600)|

| 0:47:05| So I'm going to set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2825)|

| 0:47:18| Bill Armstrong, 3311 Barton Street, North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| I'm speaking in favor of STRs, but yet I'm opposed to the proposed current ordinance impacting R1 and R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| As I like to see unoccupied property as well, and even perhaps grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| But I'd like to ask the City Council, what are some of the benefits of STRs we consider this in our city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| It clearly indicates it's a sign of progressiveness for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| Why, who would have thought ten years ago we'd have Uber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| We'd have food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| It will create a new tax base as it brings visitors to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| This avenue of lodging is what, in many cases, is the very first place that people look to for lodging nowadays, STRs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2879)|
| 0:48:07| You may be asking, why such interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| It's the personalized attention they get in our homes or our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| They have interaction with us as homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| The STR program is totally unlike a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| We set minimum nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| We set maximum nights for our guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| We set the number of guests that come into our homes or our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| We also have the opportunity, which is very important to me, in reviewing their previous history, unlike a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2911)|
| 0:48:40| I've had guests with lengthy stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| I've had some with short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| Some come due to job transfers in our community looking for homes with no place to live as they've sold their previous one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2924)|
| 0:48:52| I've had traveling nurses working within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| I've had one recently, just last weekend, left while she was here looking for a warm and inviting setting, caring for her parents in hospice care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2936)|
| 0:49:07| Some neighborhood associations, I understand, are against STRs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| It's only because they do not fully understand how they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| The proposed regulations will address any problems that have been brought up in previous meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| seeing as how, as to records right now, we only have roughly five complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| I can tell you for me personally, our neighbors in my community welcome STRs in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2966)|
| 0:49:33| There's been no problems whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| There's been cohesiveness maintained within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| I have actually taken a foreclosed home, vacant for years, and eyesored the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2980)|
| 0:49:47| After major renovation, it's now a welcomed addition to the Edgewood Park Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2987)|
| 0:49:55| Just some thoughts to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| Thank you very much, Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| Now, Deborah Olsen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| Thank you for coming, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| My name is Deborah Olsen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| I live at 6700 East Lake Ford Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| What I really wanted to talk about at our last meeting here was to bring some of those points back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3016)|
| 0:50:22| There are currently five complaints on STRs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| And then we found out at the last meeting that there have been roughly 8,000 short-term reservations in Knoxville during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3026)|
| 0:50:35| Only five complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| To me, that's not a whole lot of complaints against the amount of people that have utilized this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3037)|
| 0:50:45| So, to me, the people who are against this truly has to be out of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| There is not a lot of bad things happening in STRs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| If anything, it does bring an area up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| It brings people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| There are people, I'm in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| South Knoxville is growing immensely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| There are not hotels in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| People are coming here, I have guests right now, to stay at Iams Nature Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| If you close up the R1 area in South Knoxville, people will not have anywhere to stay for Iams Nature Center, the new bike trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3072)|
| 0:51:22| At the South Oil Middle School, they're looking to make another bike event center there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| So, to me, it's not a real problem at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| I don't see coming in and swooping in and making major changes right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| I am for this proposal, but I am against keeping it out of the R1 and R1E zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3100)|
| 0:51:47| I am for having one owner-occupant and two non-owner-occupants that are currently in the proposal, but allow them in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3107)|
| 0:51:57| If you keep that number down, you are keeping businesses from coming in and taking over areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| It's still a mom and pop, and that's what I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| I have six rentals, one short-term and five long-term, and out of those five long-term, three are on Section 8 vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3124)|
| 0:52:14| I choose to do that to help local people to be able to have affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| I'm doing that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| So, I'm doing that, and I have one short-term rental to help offset those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| But if you take that away, then it hurts me with my long-term stuff, helping other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3148)|
| 0:52:35| I just don't want to see it close down so quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| I think there are a lot of sides to this, and I really look forward to talking to some of the people that are opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| I do want to be more educated on why you're so fearful of this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| but I thank you all for taking the time to look at running a few more forums to get a little more information about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| and thank you for your time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| Okay, Mr. Daniels, do you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| Okay, so everybody remember, watch our STR site and our social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| We will let you know when Council has the upcoming workshops about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| Council, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170718?start=3202)|
