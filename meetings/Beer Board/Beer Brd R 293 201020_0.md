| 0:01:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=107)|

| 0:02:08| Eight in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| Very good. All right. Before we get started, I have a few announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| We have 13 beer permit applications before us tonight, as well as three addendum items and one administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=134)|
| 0:02:21| As you can see, today's meeting, like in September, is being held on Zoom, and that will make things a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=141)|
| 0:02:27| Although we've been doing this so long, maybe it's not so different anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| But when I call the names of businesses applying for the permit, please raise your hand in the Zoom session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=150)|
| 0:02:36| To speak, you need to dial star 9 on your phone if you're calling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=156)|
| 0:02:43| And to mute or unmute yourself, you need to dial star 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| When called on, please state your name and address clearly for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| Applicants who are approved pending final documentation will need to bring their completed documents to the business tax office during regular business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=171)|
| 0:02:59| As I'm chairing the meeting, other members will be making the motions with regard to the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| Because our meeting is held on Zoom, just like in previous meetings and you saw earlier in the minutes, we'll be making each vote by roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=185)|
| 0:03:13| All right. Let's get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| I'm going to go ahead and combine items 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| As you'll see in your packet, those are all the same applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| So just combining those four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| So I'll start off by asking Sergeant Coward about items 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=210)|
| 0:03:39| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| And Mr. Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| All those files are complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Now, Sergeant Coward, did the applicants in 4A, B, C, and D, did they still need the task class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=227)|
| 0:03:55| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| So my understanding is then we could move this pending final documentation because Mr. Byrd can receive the task class and that is his document to move forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=237)|
| 0:04:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| Do we have anyone from Cracker Barrel here with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| Mr. Tayo Atanda, I believe is representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| Can you state your name and address for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=266)|

| 0:06:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| Mr. McKenzie, I'd like to have a question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| Go ahead, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| So, I just want to ask, is this a national strategy that Cracker Barrel is moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=399)|
| 0:06:46| with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| And if so, can you tell me if there are any adjacent states to Tennessee that have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| implemented the selling of alcohol and beer, or beer rather, in the Cracker Barrel restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| and stores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| So, we have been engaged just to represent them here in Tennessee, but I am aware that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| they have already started selling in Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| And as a matter of fact, we licensed most of their stores in New Tennessee earlier on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| this summer, and some of those stores may already be selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| And I also understand that Kentucky is another state where they're actually moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| with licensing some of their stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| And so, you know, I'm not sure how far, wide and national it is going to be, but this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| a step that they're taking in multiple states at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| And I apologize, Vice Mayor, I only have some of the members on my screen, so if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=457)|
| 0:07:46| raising your hand and you don't hear me calling you, there, I see you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=466)|

| 0:08:21| that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| You know, if they have, I think some of the stores, if they have existing groups, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| might make ways to accommodate folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| And I know that's not a perfect answer, but I hear your concerns, and I appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=512)|
| 0:08:41| I'll second her motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=521)|

| 0:10:43| I've got a question from Councilperson Sang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| I was simply going to ask, when do they think they can get these documents together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| We have talked to the, you know, the officer, and he have sent me the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=652)|
| 0:11:01| And we have the best way as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| We have called the architect, and he everything planned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| And we have submitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| It sounds like you're still a way away from it happening, coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| When are you going to be opening, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| We don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| Just that we have under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| When we get the beer, we bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| So, we have the big thing, you know, the city approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| And we have to close the property, and we have to start the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| Because right now, we're not bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| It's under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| So, you know, release the permit right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| But you have as long to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| And we have to start over the property and start the work in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| Because we removed the laundromat in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| And we put the convenience store in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| All I'm asking is when, what were the items that were missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| The fire inspection, health department, and something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| When will you have those together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| Do those have to do with the architect also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Fire department we talked to, he want just, you know, was the fire tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| For the exit door sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| So, we have the already exit sign over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| And we bought the, you know, the fire tank over there and leave in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| And she won't need some of the architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=757)|
| 0:12:46| And we have to make the cooler or the gondola or the counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| So, and how much the landscaping and what's the building size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| She want some of the blueprint or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| So, we have to contact the architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| She suggests us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| I'm just wondering, and I don't know if this is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| Do you want to postpone for 30 days and get these things done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=792)|
| 0:13:21| Today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| Can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=804)|

| 0:13:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Chairman, does that sound right procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| I think that if they want to postpone for 30 days, I don't think there's any reason for us not to grant that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| Mr. Frost, have I missed anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| No, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| That is an option that you can't outright grant them their beer permit today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| You can either postpone or approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=835)|

| 0:14:04| They have 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=844)|

| 0:14:37| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=877)|

| 0:14:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=897)|

| 0:15:15| But that is a priority motion that she receives a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=915)|

| 0:26:16| Yes. I would ask Mr. Odom to tell us a little bit about this event. It's a very worthwhile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| cause, and I think our viewers would like to know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| Yes, sir. Thank you for asking. So, the short version is, basically, it's going to benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| ex-Hunger and Scarecrow Foundation, which is a local kind of non-profit umbrella for other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1591)|

| 0:26:44| But so, it's basically Knoxville's first drive-in music festival. I was a part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| six drive-in concerts that took place up at Smokey Stadium. And so, on a much smaller scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| we wanted to bring it here to town. We are going over the top with all the measures and protocols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1617)|
| 0:27:05| that we learned were very effective. And we didn't have any problems with anything. Nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| got sick. There weren't any alcohol-related problems up there. So, after doing those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| we feel really comfortable that we're going to be able to put together an event and bring music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| back to people here in Knoxville this Halloween. So, we're pretty excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| Okay. Sounds like a lot of fun and also for a very worthy cause. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| your friend, Jimmy Buckner, has been heavily involved. There's a group that you can find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| more from ex-hunger.com, if anybody would want more information. Thank you, Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1656)|

| 0:27:58| were comfortable with it. So, cheers to you, Mr. Odom, for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| Thank you, sir. Very good. Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1682)|

| 0:31:33| If we want to go through the two numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Okay. Mr. Bailey, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| You're here for item 5A, Aurora Restaurant and Grill. Can you please raise your hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1908)|
| 0:31:55| or say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| To unmute yourself, you need to hit star six on your telephone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| I've enabled caller ending telephone number 666.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1922)|
| 0:32:11| They're not responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1933)|
| 0:32:13| Go to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| Move on to 5B and we can come back to 5A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| All right. Next, we have 5B, Pete Cook Bowl. Do we have anyone with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1938)|
| 0:32:29| So agenda item 5B, Pete Cook Bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| No one appears to be raising their hand for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| Okay. Mr. Byrd, did you have any conversations with anyone from Pete Cook Bowl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1959)|
| 0:32:50| There, I've sent a certified letter, got my little notation back, but not an indication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1970)|
| 0:32:57| Let's see. Let me double check that it's not an indication it was signed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| Someone has raised their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| Actually, I got the signature card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Yes, someone has raised their hand. I'm enabling them to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| Hello, are you here with us for 5B, Pete Cook Bowl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1985)|
| 0:33:17| I believe you've been enabled to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| Hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1999)|
| 0:33:19| They need to unmute themselves. Hit star six on your phone to unmute yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| Can you hear us, caller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2005)|
| 0:33:38| They've unmuted themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| Are you here for item 5B, Pete Cook Bowl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2023)|
| 0:33:52| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| I'm in Dynasty Asia Cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| Oh, okay. We're not at your item yet. We've got a couple in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| So if you could just hang on for us, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| All right. Mr. Johnson, any activity for Pete Cook Bowl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| Okay. Well, let's move on to 5C, and we'll come back to the first two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| 5C is Smoky Mountain Meadery. Do we have anyone from Smoky Mountain Meadery with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| Yes, this is Aaron Allen Ogle at 1335 Western Avenue, Knoxville 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2073)|
| 0:34:42| Sorry to be before you again here this evening, ladies and gentlemen, but we are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| Okay. Well, I'll just walk us through where we are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| Looks like you were approved pending file documentation back in January of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| extension granted July, extension granted October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| or extension granted to here where we are today in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| Looks like you still need fire building and health approvals. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| Yes, sir. That is correct. We were actually approved again there, and I believe it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| April passed through. But yes, the first one was January, and then we did stop everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| in March. And then, of course, we passed through there in April, picked back up in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| and we had the meeting in July. And I truly felt that we wouldn't be here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| that we would be finalized in October. The point we're at now, what I've got information going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| forward, delays, COVID, I mean, you can say a couple of different things, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2146)|
| 0:35:54| But our architect has finally got everything ready and has committed to turning in his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| architectural plans to the city of Knoxville on November 1st. Then we have our contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| Christopoulos and Kennedy, who have committed November 2nd, pending approval from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| to pull the permits and start and finalize build out and placement of equipment. And that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2173)|
| 0:36:21| take 45 days, approximately 45 days on there is where we're at. So my hands have been tied the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2181)|
| 0:36:29| past two months. I've been frustrated. But we are at the point to where the plans are to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| submitted on November 1st and we can move forward with finishing the build out and putting our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| equipment in place. So I understand the progress that you're making. How much time do you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2200)|
| 0:36:47| you need to be able to complete all of these? I know you said something about 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| Do you think you'd be able to do it within 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| Just going off of how everything has gone in the past, it seems like everything has taken more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| My understanding is that we can have everything in place and ready. Yeah, 45 days after November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| 1st, which would put us about December 20th in there. If you would allow it, I would ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2231)|
| 0:37:19| the full 90 days just because of the history here and the delays that we have had and if you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2239)|
| 0:37:27| allow it. So that would be the January meeting of the Beer Board? Yes, sir. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2247)|
| 0:37:35| All right. Any other discussion? To clarify, the 90 days would put it at January 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| which is past your January meeting, which is on wait. Well, what we're saying is that we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| to have the, we're going to have, we're going to give them until the January 2021 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| Yeah, that's January 26. My apologies. That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Do we have any further discussion or any motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2279)|
| 0:38:10| So the issue at hand is that the background checks were done in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2290)|
| 0:38:18| of 2019. I'm just asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| Sergeant Coward? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| Two people spoke, so Sergeant Coward? Yes, that is correct. Okay. October 2019. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2306)|
| 0:38:37| Would you be willing to have another background check between now and the January meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2317)|
| 0:38:46| Certainly. There's three members, but we would all three if we needed to. Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| we could get the background checks. I'm not necessarily, I mean, Sergeant Coward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2330)|
| 0:38:59| do you feel that that's needed or, I mean, other than, that's the documentation we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2339)|
| 0:39:07| is background checks and everything else is building permits. Over a year since their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| background check and, you know, going by past history, anything that's taken that long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2354)|
| 0:39:23| we've always required the people to get a new check. So the question is, they don't have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2363)|
| 0:39:33| what fees will that cost them? The cost for the background check is $35.12 per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2373)|
| 0:39:45| Okay. So they're not having to pay the fee for a new beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| it'd just be getting new background checks? Correct. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2389)|
| 0:39:56| So I guess, Mr. Frost, just to clarify, so do we make a motion to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2396)|
| 0:40:03| You're making a motion to extend them until the January 2021 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| Okay. If there is no motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2410)|
| 0:40:17| then it's not extended and these gentlemen would have to reapply again and start anew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2417)|
| 0:40:25| Okay. Is there anything formal to attach to the motion just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| acknowledge them getting new background checks since it's been well over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| Well, I think you heard the gentleman state that they would voluntarily do so. So I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2436)|
| 0:40:44| that's necessary to wrap up in a motion out of a matter of trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| Okay. Just if we have to see them again in January, that's something that we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2451)|
| 0:40:59| Okay. I'll make a motion to postpone to our January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| Second. I have a motion. I hear several seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| Any further discussion? All right. Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| Councilman Ryder? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| Councilman DiBerto? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Councilman Singh? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| Councilman Smith? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| Councilman Testerman? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| Councilman Thomas? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| Councilman Fugate? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| Councilman McKenzie? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| Councilman Parker? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| All in favor? Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| All right. Mr. Johnson, that takes us back to item 5A, Aurora Restaurant and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| Have we got anyone who's joined us? There's no one new present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| I think Mr. Bailey might be trying to dial back in. During the last item, I called him on my phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| and kind of went over the process again. So perhaps he'll be dialing in in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| Okay. Well, we'll come back to him then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| Okay. And we can look at 5B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| Pete Cook Bowl. Mr. Johnson, we've got any activity there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| No, sir. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| Well, Mr. Frost, we don't have folks here on items 5A and 5B, and we've called them several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2540)|
| 0:42:29| What are our options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| Well, if there's no response, I mean, people don't show up for different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2553)|
| 0:42:43| You know, sometimes people decide to not go forward. But unless the beer board acts to extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2563)|
| 0:42:50| either permit, it will die, and they won't be barred from applying for a permit again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| They'll just have to start from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| Well, it certainly sounded like with what Mr. Byrd was describing to us that he was trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| get in touch with at least one of these applicants. I might suggest that we postpone both to our next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2587)|
| 0:43:15| meeting and give them a little time, and that gives us time to reach back out to them and try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| to get them online with us. Does that seem reasonable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2601)|
| 0:43:28| That's within the discretion of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| Yeah, I think we should give them the benefit of the doubt, particularly the fellow who's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| trying to call in. So it'll just be two weeks, and maybe everything will clear up by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| Well, actually, it's a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| It'll be a month because it'll be the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| It will be. Yes, it will. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| That might be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| Okay. So, Mr. Councilperson Thomas, was that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| It was a motion. And I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| Okay. I hear a motion to move us to move items 5A and 5B to the November agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2637)|
| 0:44:05| And I believe I heard a second. I seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| All right. I heard a second. Very good. Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| And that'll be a nine-month. That'll be a nine-month. If the applicants are listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| it's not two weeks. It's one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| It's in November. Okay. Mr. Johnson, please call a roll call vote to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| items 5A and 5B to our November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| Councilman Thomas? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| Councilman Fugate? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| Councilman McKenzie? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| Councilman Parker? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| Councilman Ryder? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| Councilman Roberto? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Councilman Singh? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| Councilman Smith? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| And Councilman Testimon? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| All right. Move to November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| That brings us to item 6 or agenda part 6, Beer Board Administrative Hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| Earlier, we had the applicant for Limb Dynasty Asia Cafe, which is item 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2702)|
| 0:45:09| Are you still with us? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| All right. Very good. All right. In this one, we had had some discussions earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2712)|
| 0:45:20| last meeting on this item, and we can just pick up where we were. I know there were several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| questions that the members had, so I'll open it back up for continued discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2726)|
| 0:45:39| All right. Councilperson Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| Thank you. So, I'm trying to recall all the details of last time. I'd like to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| it's the same person that sold to an underage person twice. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2749)|
| 0:45:57| Yes. I'll review that for you. We had a January 10, 2020, citation for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2757)|
| 0:46:05| That was the first in a two-year period. Then we had a January 22, remedial plan that was received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| Then we had an August 26, citation for sale to a minor. That was the second in the two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| An August 31, notice of administrative hearing. And then we received a remedial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2778)|
| 0:46:26| revised remedial plan, September 4. And Sergeant Coward confirmed for us last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| that it was the same individual who committed the offense both times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2792)|
| 0:46:38| Thank you. I'm just wondering what the remediation plan looked like after the first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2798)|
| 0:46:46| and then what you changed after the second offense. How are you dealing with these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| Okay. Yeah, I'm just, after the second offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2812)|
| 0:47:10| I might have you start with giving us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2830)|
| 0:47:21| I've enabled another occurrence. Phillip Lim is signed in, perhaps on a device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2841)|
| 0:47:41| Okay. Yeah, he's with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| Oh, very good. Can you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| Luis Lim, L-I-M, 1708 Callahan Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2869)|
| 0:47:58| Okay. The question that was posed, I'm not sure if you heard it, was, what was the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| between your remedial plan in January and your remedial plan in September? Can you tell us what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2884)|
| 0:48:13| items you, what action items you had in that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| Okay. The second offense, we installed a scanner, ID scanner, so that regardless of, they can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2897)|
| 0:48:26| manual check at the same time, scan their ID to make sure it's really like not underage. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2906)|
| 0:48:35| the person cannot serve alcohol at all. So if there's any customer of hers wants any beer or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2915)|
| 0:48:45| alcohol, she needs to call the manager or the supervisor or the bartender to serve and check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2925)|
| 0:48:53| the ID. Okay. When did you install the scanner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2933)|
| 0:49:01| After the second offense. Okay. So she's still working there and she simply, if somebody orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2941)|
| 0:49:11| a drink, what does she do? She called the manager. If the manager is not available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| the supervisor. If the supervisor is not available, call the bartender or the senior server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. So, Council, I'll just remind you that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2963)|
| 0:49:35| two options. We can refer this to a suspension revocation hearing, or if we take no action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| then they'll automatically go to a suspension revocation hearing upon the next offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| Okay. I move to take no action at this point. And if there is a third offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2987)|
| 0:49:59| you know, immediately go to that. They'll go automatically. They won't even come see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| I would second that. Okay. Well, if unless somebody wants to make a motion to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| then I'll take that as we're going to take no action. Is there any other discussion on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| item? Technically, there was already a motion at the last meeting to send it to a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=3016)|
| 0:50:26| Whether or not you want to vote on that is up to the beer board. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| it was pending when this was postponed. Well, we had a motion to send it for a hearing, but then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=3030)|
| 0:50:38| that was superseded with a motion to postpone for 30 days. So, I would take that as we'd have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=3038)|
| 0:50:47| to have a new motion to send for a revocation hearing. We started anew. We started anew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=3047)|
| 0:50:54| I'm glad I got that right. Okay. So, I'm looking for any other discussion on this item. Otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=3054)|
| 0:51:02| we're going to take no action. All right. Seeing none, we're going to take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| All right. That, Mr. Johnson, I believe that takes us to the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| And we have no more business. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| Seeing no more business, this meeting is adjourned. Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201020?start=3079)|
