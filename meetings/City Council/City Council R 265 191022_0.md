| 0:02:47| For the mayor's report, we have a few congratulations that are in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| First of all, I want to congratulate Marshall and Natalie Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| They made the big announcement recently that little Stella will have a baby brother come April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| Doing our part to grow the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| Well, we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| Congratulations, and I know it's a very exciting time for you and Natalie and for Stella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| And we wish you all the best of luck and good health for Natalie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| Good health for you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| Also, is Colin Ickes here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| Oh, Colin, come on up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| So Colin Ickes, as you all know, is director of the Knoxville-Knox County Emergency Management Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| And he has recently received the Emergency Management Association of Tennessee's Achievement Award for Excellence in Job Performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=214)|
| 0:03:44| That's a pretty big, long title name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| But the Achievement Award for Excellence in Job Performance from the Emergency Management Association of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=226)|
| 0:03:54| So we want to congratulate you on this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| In April of 2016, it was my pleasure, along with then-Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett, to name Colin as our KEMA director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=238)|
| 0:04:07| When the director's position became available, Colin was a pretty easy choice to make because he was tried and true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=247)|
| 0:04:14| a veteran who had already demonstrated judgment and know-how in the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| He had served as operations officer at KEMA for the previous 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| So his exemplary service as director comes as no surprise to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| You all know I'm sure that KEMA is a joint city-county agency that serves as the central point of contact for local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=270)|
| 0:04:38| for all major emergencies and disasters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| And KEMA works in partnership with local, state, and federal agencies, as well as industry and volunteer organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=281)|
| 0:04:49| So congratulations, Colin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| And I don't know if you want to say anything or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| No, ma'am, just thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| All right, thank you, Colin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| Man, a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| My next congratulations goes to the City Fleet Services Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| And if all of them would come up, as well as the representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| Oh, they're right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| With PERC and with Beardsley Community Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| Earlier today, the Propane Education and Research Council, or PERC, P-E-R-C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| recognized the City of Knoxville with its National Green City Leadership Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| And with the award comes a $5,000 donation to Beardsley Community Farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| helping it to further enhance its mission as an educational resource on local sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| We love that 5,000 right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| And I have to say, plus PERC, and we're going to hear from Jeremy Wishart in just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=345)|
| 0:05:52| but not only did they bring this award for us, they brought a check for $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| and they fed lunch to many of our public service and fleet services employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| to show their appreciation for the great work that they are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| So, I want to recognize Jeremy Wishart, who is the Director of Off-Road Business Development with PERC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=368)|
| 0:06:16| Khan Shove, who is the Urban Agriculture Director at Beardsley Community Farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| and, of course, Keith Shields, our Fleet Services Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| Jeremy, do you want to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Earlier today at Century Park, we completed an award presentation to the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| also hosted the fleet services, fed them lunch, went through a very quick awards presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| I just want to say congratulations to the City of Knoxville for being our 2019 Green Leadership City Award recipient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| and also congratulations on your commitment to sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| your adoption of propane into your equipment fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| and also for meeting your greenhouse gas emissions reductions goals early, mind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| We made that point several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| Keith, do you want to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| I'd just like to thank the Propane Education Research Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| Certainly, this was a surprise when I received the email starting the dialogue that they wanted to recognize us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| and certainly it's a multi-pronged approach to our alternative fuel fleet on how we do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| and the advances we're making in clean energy and clean emissions here in the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| So, I thank the Council for your support during the eight years of the Mayor's administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| and all the things we've done to advance our fleet during that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Khan, do you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| We greatly appreciate your consideration and support of Beardsley Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| We definitely depend on community support and dollars to keep our programs running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| and this is a huge dent in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| So, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| Thank you to PERC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| Just a few more things I want to make sure everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| Fleet services is a shining example of how innovation and intentionality are shrinking our carbon footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=481)|
| 0:08:09| We have reduced our fleet emissions by 10% from 2005 levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| You all know we're exceeding our 20% goal by year 2020, actually a year early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| but fleet alone has reduced theirs by 10%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| and Keith's team is constantly looking for ways to increase fuel efficiency and switch to alternative fuels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| The PERC award recognizes that we're converting to propane mowers, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| In fact, right now, 18 of our 25 commercial mowers are fueled by propane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| making Knoxville's fleet the largest propane mower fleet in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| And also, when Jeremy gave this award to us earlier, he said this is the third year that they're giving out the award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=528)|
| 0:08:56| Miami-Dade won and Louisville, Kentucky, so we're in some very good company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| and we beat out some really great cities that are doing a lot of climate work like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| So, thank you again, Jeremy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| Thanks to Keith and all the work of your team, and thanks for all you all do at Beardsley Farm as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=554)|

| 0:17:27| It's a very strong message, and for all of you men at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1047)|

| 0:28:06| If I could first just ask Mr. Frost, if you don't mind reminding us what the criteria are for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1686)|
| 0:28:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Thank you, Councilmember Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| It's Article 7, Section 2, the standards for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| I'll abbreviate because it's rather long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| In granting a variance, the board shall ascertain that the following criteria are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| Variances shall only be granted where special circumstances or conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| such as exceptional nearness, topography, or siting, fully described in the findings of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| do not apply generally in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Variances shall not be granted to allow use otherwise excluded from the particular district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| for reasons set forth if foresaid circumstances or condition are such that strict applications of the provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1728)|
| 0:28:56| would deprive the applicant of any reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| There must be deprivation of beneficial use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| Any variance granted under the provisions of this section shall be the minimum adjustment necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| for the reasonable use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| The granting of any variance is in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, detrimental to the public welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| or in conflict with the comprehensive plan for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| It goes on to discuss the requirements for granting a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| Again, I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| The person claiming the variance has the burden of showing that the granting of the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| will not be contrary to the public interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| that the literal enforcement of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| that by granting the permit contrary to the provisions of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| the spirit of the ordinance will be observed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| and that by granting the permit substantial justice will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| I do have several questions for Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| Mr. Ahrens, could you start out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| I think there's some new information that I just learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| Talk a little bit about the parking, the duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| Tell me what that means, and then I have some other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| So a single-family house is required to have two parking spaces off-street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| A duplex is required to have four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| When we were preparing for the Board of Zoning Appeals request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| we performed research and we relied heavily on some complaints from 2011 that are in our system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1835)|
| 0:30:43| articulating dividing the house into units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| And so from that, we really stood firm on it was a single-family dwelling back in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1847)|
| 0:30:54| and we had no evidence of it changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| Since then, as we've continued to look into this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| we do feel that there's ample evidence to call it a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1862)|
| 0:31:09| How does that impact the parking variance request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| So if it was a duplex prior to BZA, we would not reevaluate parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| It would be a preexisting nonconforming situation, and it would not need to come into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| So the four parking space requirement for duplexes would not apply in this case if the duplex was permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1886)|
| 0:31:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| It would be considered a preexisting nonconforming situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| I do have a few more questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Because there are several other variances that are requested as well around setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| So what are some of the uses that could be permitted on this lot and in this zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| I believe this is R3, so it allows anything up to multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| It does allow for pretty intense usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| But without digging into it, limited to residential type uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| It allows for single family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| And this lot is about, if I remember correctly, about 3,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| Is this lot atypical in its size or dimension or the slope for the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1944)|
| 0:32:33| I'm not sure there's a typical lot in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| They're all pretty unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| If you look at that block, there's three right in a row that are similar, but the fourth one is significantly deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1960)|
| 0:32:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| They're all interesting and special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| They're all a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| So there's not a typical lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| I would say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| Is this out of the range of what would be considered a lot in R3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| You might not have looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| Are you asking if it's appropriate to be considered R3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| One of the criteria for granting a variance is based on hardship because it's an unusual situation on the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=1995)|
| 0:33:23| So if the lot dimensions or if the lot slope or the topography is such that it would be a hardship, then a variance would be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2003)|
| 0:33:36| It's not a large lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| I'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| I don't know if I'm the best judge of whether it's, I think that's up to the applicant to articulate why it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2022)|
| 0:33:50| It is worthy of a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| And then I guess this is, sorry to sort of reiterate similar types of questions, but I'm just trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| Again, when I understand the criteria for and the standards for a variance, it's based on hardship and depriving the owner of reasonable use of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2045)|
| 0:34:19| That's what we're tasked with determining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| So what I'm trying to determine is could the property be used for other purposes without variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2061)|
| 0:34:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| So the property could be used for other purposes without the need for variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2073)|
| 0:34:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| I was waiting to hear from one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| So now we'll go to the appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Mr. Holmes, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| I'm going to set the timer, and you have up to five minutes to make your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| And counsel may have questions of you afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| But thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| My name is John Holmes, 5914 Gray Gables Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| Could you pull the mic a little closer there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| Sorry, I would probably start back with the minutes from the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| And I would just point to the paragraph at the end to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| And it notes that Chairman Kristen Grove stated that this was in front of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| was a series of variances that were basically dependent on the parking reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| And taking it to zero was something that they were not comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| Now that we've established that's not the issue at hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| everything else was basically dismissed upon that one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| On my first, I guess do you all have a copy of the packets here in front of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| You know, we were going to talk about being a duplex first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| We can kind of skip over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| The second point is this house is in the NC1 overlay, so it's a historical house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| And to give you a little bit of idea of the history, it was originally built in 1903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| The addition, which is the part at the rear that we want to rebuild, was built in 1930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| So it's 89 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| Typically 50 years is what it takes to be on the historical register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| We're not asking to increase the footprint of what was already existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| We are asking to safely rebuild the back apartment, which was already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| We already have a building permit in place for the second apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| as a repair of the existing structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| When we got through part of it, we were unable to repair it in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| The structure was just so poor it was not safe to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| So we had to go get another permit to remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| And again, we're only asking to rebuild what was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| And if you look at in your packet the HCZ approval, it's kind of six or seven pages deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2212)|
| 0:37:03| It's the HCZ approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| And if you read on that, the rear addition is approved to reconstruct the rear addition in phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2228)|
| 0:37:17| And if you go to the next page, this was approved back in March of 2019 by HCZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2237)|
| 0:37:26| One more page, you'll see where 1601 Forest is on the National Register for Historic Places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2246)|
| 0:37:33| One more page will show you the footprint of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2253)|
| 0:37:41| Two more pages will show you the actual elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| So we have approved building elevation showing historically what the house has to be reconstructed to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2263)|
| 0:38:02| And then the last point is we've been working on this project for 13 months now, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| So apartment one is already complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| And if you look towards the end of the package, you'll see a picture that has a yellow wall, a large yellow wall in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2290)|
| 0:38:19| That is the fire separation wall between the two apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| That has already been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| Everything in apartment one is basically ready for drywall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| To go back and change our plans now and to not rebuild what was historically there is an undue hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2307)|
| 0:38:35| We had permits in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Basically everything, all the utilities of apartment one would change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| The sewer connections, the water connections, gas lines which were installed, everything would have to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2322)|
| 0:38:57| Is there anything else, sir, that you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| I believe that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you, Mr. Holmes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| So, Peter, go back and explain how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| I mean, he's been working on it for 13 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| He's gotten approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| And explain how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| I mean, go back to the parking, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| I mean, address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| Would that have been, should this go back to BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| Talk about how we got here and the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| Here's how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| A permit was pulled for some repairs and then some interior alterations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| And those types of permits are not reviewed fully by zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| We don't research every single project that comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| If somebody says, we're doing a repair to this structure, we say, okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| We want to make sure that it's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| Throughout the course of inspections, the building inspector said, wait a minute, this is not a repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| This can't be repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| It's beyond repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| So the decision was made to remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| And once it's gone, now whatever's reinstalled or built back has to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| That's when we start evaluating for zoning compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| That's how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| So you took down all the walls and the footers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| Mr. Holmes, is that what you did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Did you come back on the existing footers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| So on the front part of the house, we actually had the jacket up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| We removed the whole foundation, rebuilt the foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| and then we were moving to the back apartment to start rebuilding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| When we got to the back section, it got to be the structure was in such poor shape, we couldn't safely do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| I would also point you to, in my packet, there's a City of Knoxville plans review page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| It's got the number R18-1190 on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| That's the plans review number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| These were not over-the-counter permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| They were both reviewed by building and zoning, and they were approved by zoning on 10-31 of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2457)|
| 0:41:05| Not for one permit, but for two different permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2465)|
| 0:41:13| It's R18-1190.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| Mr. Aarons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| It's a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Again, it's an interior alteration, and we rely on the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| We don't do an exhaustive research project on every project that comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| We get alterations all day, and so we really do rely on the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| We drill down once we get into expansion and additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2498)|
| 0:41:48| So that's how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| We started out with a remodel, and it ended up being a full structural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2510)|
| 0:41:57| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| It started off as a repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| Alterations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| Then it turned into an alteration, and then it turned into pretty much a tear down the backside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| and we're going to build something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| So how did he get to build the part that's new that he says now he would lose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| Did he have a permit for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| That's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| That's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| We'd already built it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| The back half is not built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| It's not built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| I thought you said, Mr. Holmes, that you're not granted the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| Part of the back half is, if you look at the picture towards the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| It's not in color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| So when you say yellow wall, that doesn't mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| It's this picture here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| I see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| So you can see there's probably a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| H197 in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| There's a 12-foot section on the right where the foundation was originally in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| We have some of the original framing left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| That's as far as we are, and then we got stopped at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| So some of it's left, but not enough of it to classify it, Mr. Aarons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| That's a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Is there a percentage that you all go by that says no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| It's case by case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| But you decided in this case that that was too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| But he left some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| I'll go ahead and I'll get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| I'm going to start with a statement on a comment, and then I'll have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| First off, I just want to clarify that Historic Zoning Commission does not address use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| They only address outsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| So in terms of whether something's a duplex or not, that's not their purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| But I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| So I'm looking through the packet here, and we have multiple different building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| You guys cited R-18-1190 a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| There's building permit 18-2788.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| Here in the packet, I've got BU-19-1491, which says demolition duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2636)|
| 0:44:03| That one's on page 185.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| So there's BU-2078 is the building permit for Apartment 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| 2079 is for Apartment 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| The third one you mentioned is the demolition permit to remove the remaining standing section of the back duplex that we couldn't salvage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2653)|
| 0:44:21| Which was issued in September, and some of these start, like R-18-1190 started in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2661)|
| 0:44:28| It goes a ways back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| So we just removed the last section a couple months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| Just because it was so unstable, we didn't want it to be a safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| So what I'm trying to discern, Mr. Ahrens, this started as a permit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2679)|
| 0:44:47| I think this is where the disagreement is, to see if I can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| As someone applying to rehab what exists, and then moving on with a plan to alter the footprint of what existed without actually getting permission to alter it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2694)|
| 0:45:12| It's like cart before the horse is kind of how I'm seeing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| From our perspective, the scope of work was beyond that which was permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| In other words, Mr. Holmes, when I hear you say you've done all this work, and I look at the one where you refer to, page 197,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2723)|
| 0:45:34| where I can see the fire separation between Unit 1 and Unit 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| You went ahead and started building and spending money and are in action to go on and do Unit 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2741)|
| 0:45:50| before you had permits and permission to do Unit 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| So now you're in the catch-22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| I take those words from the variance hearing of you've spent the money for something that you can't actually get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2756)|
| 0:46:04| Partially, but if you look at what the timeline is, we started this project last August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| It was 14 months ago now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| At that point, we had to do the foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| We had to do Apartment 1 first, logically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| We'd already done part of the foundation of Section 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| When we got to the back, the original intent was to take four or five foot sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| repair a section, and then move on to the next section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| Once we got the first one down, we were told, well, no, you can't do it in small sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| We also had an encroachment issue to deal with, so we went and got it replatted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| We fixed the encroachment issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| That took four or five months to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Once that was done, we were told we need to get a variance now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| We're not trying to enlarge the footprint at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| We just want to rebuild what was already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| It's just kind of how you get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| When you take on some of these older projects, you don't always know what the structure is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| Until you take everything apart and the walls, it may be in perfect condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| You can repair it in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Sometimes a section's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| I guess my question is my understanding of the process is that was there ever a point at the start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| where you get a plans review and say this is where we are and this is what we think it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| and we think we can repair it, but when we get in there, we might find that it's not repairable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| because that's a given with an old structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| I've been there myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Then when you go through the plans review process, Peter, am I correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| that's where they would find out with your staff if you get to here, then you'll need this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| I'm just trying to figure out were there conversations that didn't happen on the front end is where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2866)|
| 0:47:53| and at what point we lose the preexisting nonconforming grandfathering, for those who prefer that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2873)|
| 0:48:04| Some people like it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| Where do we lose that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| I think the decision was made when we realized that the repairs, a section at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| would result in, we'll say, 99% of the back half of the structure being replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| and really like three studs remaining or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| Really keeping a few building materials just in order to maintain that status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2908)|
| 0:48:38| So we made the determination, no, you're really demolishing the back half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| so we need to treat it like an addition when you build it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| When I look at this, just to clarify, so I see a Queen Anne cottage that's built in the late 1800s, early 1900s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2930)|
| 0:49:00| and that addition is from 1930s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| 1930, yeah, 1903 for the original, 1930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| I will say that was a bad decision in the 30s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| I'm just saying, building up to the lot lines and up to the whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| and that's part of it, just because it exists and it's historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| Yeah, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| Yeah, I guess that's my question, because, I mean, so we're saying, I mean, if we deny this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2967)|
| 0:49:34| I mean, I'm looking at just the number one, the setback would have to be 25 feet instead of three and a half feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2974)|
| 0:49:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| So we would be asking them to demolish that structure and move it back 25 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| The structure that's there maintains its status in its present location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| The front structure, the Queen Anne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| So I guess let's go to page 158 in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| What are we asking to approve in terms of a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| Because number one says reduce the minimum required front yard setback on 16th Street from 25 feet to three and a half feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3008)|
| 0:50:27| The 25 feet is for the front yard for the additional structure on the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| which is basically like a house that got added onto the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| Yeah, it's because that portion of the structure is closer to the property line than that which is existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3036)|
| 0:50:44| The zoning code allows you to build along existing building lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| but that first one is a greater variance than what currently exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3050)|
| 0:50:58| But that's what's being called the front yard setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| There's two front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| All right, I failed the IQ test there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| Okay, so we are being asked to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| And then number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| This gentleman's appealed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| But that's what he's asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| Mr. Holmes is asking us to approve that variance request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| Number two is to reduce the minimum required side yard setback the north portion of the lot from five feet to 4.8 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3084)|
| 0:51:33| So we're being asked to do that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| Number three is reduce the minimum required side yard setback the west portion from five feet to 2.6 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3096)|
| 0:51:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| And there again, if you were building along existing building lines, a variance would not be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3105)|
| 0:51:53| The west side, you've got an established building line, but this addition at the rear is closer to the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3113)|
| 0:52:01| hence the need for the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| And then four, increase the maximum building coverage in an R3 NC1 from 1,046 square feet to 1,551 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3124)|
| 0:52:16| So we'd need to do that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Number five, we're saying we don't need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| What about number six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| That is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| Reduce the minimum lot size for a duplex from 5,000 to 3,485.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| But if it was preexisting nonconforming, would that not also kick that one out as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| It would not because this is considered an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| So you're increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| No, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| Number six would not be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3170)|
| 0:52:59| So, Mr. Holmes, if we don't approve this today, what would you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| Or do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| I don't have any idea, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| It kind of takes us back to the drawing board completely because we have the HCZ that says this is what it has to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3187)|
| 0:53:16| it has to conform, the exterior has to match that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| So we probably have to reevaluate everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| I honestly have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Mr. Green, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| What the HCZ approved was the appearance of the addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| If you'll read, complete the sentence that Mr. Holmes started on the certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3214)|
| 0:53:42| It says, Reconstruct rear addition in phases with the wall on the west-north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| Being set back as required by city plans review and the buildings inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| That design can still work with the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| The new addition basically shrunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| There may be some change in the dimensions, but the window placement and the siding used would still remain consistent with the HCC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3239)|
| 0:54:10| There would probably be a minor staff approval to change the dimensions somewhat of the addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| but the key elements of the HCC decisions were to address the design, the window style, the siding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3256)|
| 0:54:25| placement of doors, not the dimensions of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| And, again, the certificate of appropriateness stated that those walls should be set back as required by building plans and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3269)|
| 0:54:38| But would that, so would that sort of, the addition would have to be set back 25 feet from 16th Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| No, as Mr. Aaron said, as long as he maintained the plane of that front portion of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| which is probably set back 10 feet, so from 10 or 12 feet from the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| so maintaining that plane in addition can be made as long as they maintain that plane of the existing structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3298)|
| 0:55:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| So to clarify what Mr. Green was just saying, if you look at page 179 in our packet, there's the footprint of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3311)|
| 0:55:22| And the piece that's being counted, that's making 16th Street count as a front yard and requiring the 25-foot setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3322)|
| 0:55:31| if that went in the same plane as the back half of the house or the bay window that's bumped out, which plane does it have to be in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3331)|
| 0:55:42| Mr. Aaron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| So the existing structure on the front 16th Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| If that is, if the existing structure, if the closest portion of that is 8 feet from the property line, Mr. Holmes can build up to 8 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3348)|
| 0:55:58| The bay window would count as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| Okay, so that's the plane he needs to be in to not require that variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Thank you, sir, for the clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| Mr. Frost, I have another question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| We're being asked to approve or deny an appeal of a decision that was based on information that has since been revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3375)|
| 0:56:25| So does this not need to go back to BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| I guess that is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| The variances number, I think, five and six have gone away, but Mr. Aarons, the appellant, and I discussed that possibility of going back to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3392)|
| 0:56:48| I reached out to our law department, and they opined that if you take one variance request off, the other requests count as the same, so they can't go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3408)|
| 0:57:00| No, I didn't say it couldn't go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| I said they could send it back, but they don't have to send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| You have the option here of three things that you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| One thing that you can do, because you are kind of trying this de novo, means you get to try it all over again using the very same standard of review as the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3432)|
| 0:57:23| But, of course, the Board of Zoning Appeals now has facts available to it that it did not have available to it at the time that it considered this particular request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3443)|
| 0:57:33| which may or may not make a difference to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| So one option available to you is to refer this back to the Board of Zoning Appeals and let them reconsider it based on new facts that are available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3457)|
| 0:57:47| Another option that you have is not to do that and just say, we're not going to mess with the Board of Zoning Appeals because it doesn't matter what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| We can change it one way or the other when it comes back to us either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| So you could go ahead and do that, but that deprives the Board of Zoning Appeals of the opportunity to consider this entire matter based on all of the pertinent facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3477)|
| 0:58:08| So that's just an option for you all to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| We would vote on each of the six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| You could divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Divide the question and vote on them one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| You could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| So can I ask you, Mr. Swanson, if we were to do it that way and say we denied number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| which is to reduce the minimum required front yard setback on 16th Street from 25 to 3.5 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3514)|
| 0:58:41| Mr. Holmes has the option of not needing that variance by building within to the setback of the bay window on that site and just not jutting out from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3521)|
| 0:58:52| And then he doesn't need it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| I'll leave that to you to decide the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| I'm just going to tell you what the law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| Does Mr. Holmes have the option to resubmit with something not needing variances if he wanted to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3541)|
| 0:59:10| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| He could edit his plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| I would point out that without variance number four for the lot coverage, I can't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| No, I believe it was number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| Five and six got removed, but number four, without the percent coverage, I could do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3564)|
| 0:59:31| Is that correct, Mr. Ahrens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| You could build a smaller addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| Which is what we're saying would happen if number one changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| It might be one foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| We're already at 1,046 for apartment one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| We're adding 500 for the footprint for apartment two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| That is apartment one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| There's no space for anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| Apartment two is two stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| I'm saying the footprint of apartment one is 1,046.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| The footprint of apartment two is the other 505 square feet with two levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| It's about 1,000 square feet total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| So without number four, I can do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| What do you want to do, Stephanie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| I'm torn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| I'm just going to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| I mean, just based on the facts and my understanding of our role, the hardship can't be financial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3618)|
| 1:00:28| And I understand that you have put money and work into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| My understanding is that that is not an adequate basis for consideration of hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3635)|
| 1:00:41| And given that we have learned that the parking has been grandfathered, the square footage can be grandfathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3641)|
| 1:00:55| it's just the setbacks and the lot coverage that would have to be addressed if we deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3655)|
| 1:01:06| So, I mean, I thought I knew what I wanted to do when I came into this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| but there's new information, and that, I think, makes it a little bit harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| I think his safest bet, and I hate to do this to you, would be to refer it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| I mean, I realize it's been 14 months, but I think they're in a better position, should they approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| then it wouldn't have to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| I think it's a safer play for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| But, I mean, we can, I don't know, if you say, yeah, let's go back, I'm fine to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| or you want to vote on them one by one, we can do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| But, I mean, that's a pretty big risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| If you're denied, then what happens, Mr. Ahrens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| He's out a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| No, he submits revised drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| So, I guess if it's disapproved, I'm still a little lost as to what I can actually build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| Is the original square footage grandfathered in, so number four actually goes away, being a duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3719)|
| 1:02:06| And we can still build to, it'd obviously be a little less, because we'd have to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| item number one would go to eight feet, number two would go to five foot, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| And item number three would stay at five feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| Yes, but you would still need to address the maximum lot coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| So, I can live with reducing the footprint of one, two, and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| It just doesn't get us past number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| I can live with the eight foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| I can live with the five foot and the five foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| So, you can live with number one, just like it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| I can live, yeah, it would be eight foot instead of the 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| But I can live with number one, two, and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| Number five and six go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| All we would need is number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| It sounds like he's okay with your denial of one, two, and three and approving number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| So, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| We can just take these piecemeal and break them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| I'll support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| You'll need a motion to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| And I wish I could include the parking, but I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| Parking is such an issue in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| So, I make a motion to split this up piecemeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| Because you're second to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| Do you want to speak to dividing the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| Well, I'll make a second to divide the question, if that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| I have one more question for Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| Mr. Ahrens, in regards to the lot coverage, I'm sorry to refresh my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| As much time as we put into recode, I cannot remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| I don't know the answer in the next zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| Oh, what lot coverage is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| I mean, I could look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| In the comparable zones, the lot coverage remained the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| We took that direction from city council to maintain the same lot coverage in the comparable zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| So, right now, we have a motion and a second to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| We'll first vote on that, and then we'll vote on the others individually, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| Assuming it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| Assuming this passes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| So, the motion and second, thank you, Mr. Law Director, to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| Now, what's the next motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| I make a motion to deny the appeal to reduce the minimum required front yard setback on 16th Street from 25 to 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3872)|
| 1:04:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| Do we need to do them all separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| What do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Is that what you're asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| You're okay with that, Mr. Holmes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| We would, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| We're going to deny one, two, and three, and then vote to approve number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| So, this is number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| So, the motion is to deny number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| You ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| That denial passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| And then the next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| I make a motion to deny the reduction of the minimum required side yard setback on the north portion of the lot from 5 feet to 4.8 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3913)|
| 1:05:24| And that's also known as number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| Number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=3926)|

| 1:13:04| I saw that these are diesel-electric hybrid buses in this grant and I just was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| Have we gotten any electric buses already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4390)|

| 1:19:01| Like I say, there's other issues that I'd like to speak to someone else about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4741)|
| 1:19:11| But like I say, I've talked to Chad several times, and he just ignores it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| I've been in his office twice, wrote a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| I think I deserve an answer, and that's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| Sir, if you would stick around and speak with Mr. Brace afterwards, he can follow up with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| Mr. Micah Richardson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4773)|
| 1:19:45| Please state your name and address for the record, sir, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| And thank you for bringing those two precious children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| Praise God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| Yeah, my name is Micah Richardson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| I live at 304 South Elmwood, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| I first just want to address the council this evening, as it's drawn later and later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| I want to introduce myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| My name is Micah Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| I'm the deacon at IGIC Knoxville, the Israel God in Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| I'm a minister, a street preacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| Many of you probably have already noticed me downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| I do a lot of street ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| I'm a single parent, parent of two small children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| I was born in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| 1979 is my date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| I was raised in Rockwood, Tennessee, by the way, Lancaster, California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| Raised by Baptist parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| Now changed to Judaism, or I am a Jew, or a Makti Yehudim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| I'm here for two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| I'm here as an advocate for the poor, the poor man, the fatherless, as well as for the widows and the meek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| and a voice to those with no voice today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| My point here today is to ask why in every government building I have been a part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| public library, the council building here today, every place I've gone throughout this time of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4859)|
| 1:21:07| October, the fall festivals, whatever you want to call it, there's always these different idols we call idols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| or false gods that reference Ohalo's Eve or Shemang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4874)|
| 1:21:21| That's the true word and the true form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| This Halloween is a pagan religion that we as Jews abhor and we are grossed out by it because, as you see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4884)|
| 1:21:34| I have two children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| We walked into the public library last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| We get in a routine to go to the library with my daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| She's in Head Start and she has Fridays off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| So every Friday me and my daughter go to the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| Just here recently the library has put up a ghost, inflatable ghosts and pumpkin heads and witches and goblins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4907)|
| 1:21:58| and skulls and bones and things of that nature to inflict some type of fear in me and my children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4918)|
| 1:22:05| or to deter us from using the public resources that are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| So I just come to point these things out that this is a pagan custom, pagan religions that have been brought forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4930)|
| 1:22:19| I don't hear anybody going against it or kicking against the pricks, which I have chose to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4939)|
| 1:22:26| and I will be, like I said, an advocate for the voiceless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| I would also like to bring forth to the panel, the council here, that the U.S. Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4950)|
| 1:22:41| the First Amendment is an establishment of cause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4961)|
| 1:22:49| a free exercise clause and limitation placed upon the U.S. Congress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| preventing the second half of the establishment clause and inherently prohibiting the government to prevent free exercise of religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4973)|
| 1:23:00| While it does not prohibit Congress from preferring or evaluating one religion over another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4980)|
| 1:23:09| it does not, excuse me, I'm a little far on my words, it does not prohibit the government from doing these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=4989)|
| 1:23:20| But I would like to reference the court case of Allergency County against the Greater Pittsburgh ACLU of 1989,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5000)|
| 1:23:32| where there was a public display of a creech and a menorah and a, I don't call it a Christmas tree because there's no Christmas in X-mas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5012)|
| 1:23:42| I call it an X-mas tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| So we as Jews see this court case that there was three different religions that were grouped together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5024)|
| 1:23:52| coinciding and being displayed at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| And that's what I seek to bring forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| The holiday of Shavuot just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| Purnim, Rosh Hashanah, none of these things were addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| We didn't see none of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| No menorahs, no palm leaves, no suit coats was built on public display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| But we see everything else out here in this city when nobody is trying to put forth the effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| nor having a voice to speak upon these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| And that's why I'm here to advocate for the voiceless once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| I appreciate the time that you've heard, and that's all I have to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| And I praise God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Thank you, Mr. Richardson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| Our third speaker is Constance Severy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5073)|
| 1:24:47| Thank you for being here, Ms. Severy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| Yes, my name is Constance Severy, 301 North Charlie Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5090)|
| 1:24:58| City Council, as always, you know I'm not pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| Anytime I step to this mic, I'm not happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| Today's message, though, is going to be a little bit different and unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| because today's message I want to talk to particularly is my black people, my POC people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| my Latino and other minority demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| And white women, I'm not talking about you, because white women is not a minority demographic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| Here's the reality check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| I'm going to say it out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| It is not a minority demographic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| My concern is these people here on this council, y'all are not listening to the people, and I know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5125)|
| 1:25:33| because tonight we've had a member from the homeless population come down here and speak on behalf of the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5133)|
| 1:25:40| And many of the things that he has stated has already been said numerous occasions by myself, David, Amelia, Noah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5140)|
| 1:25:49| several of us that get up here and advocate on behalf of our homeless and lower-income minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| and other demographics of lack of underserved, under-resourced people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| And yet and still, I watch today, again, millions of dollars go out the door once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5159)|
| 1:26:06| So we think it's appropriate to spend, what, almost $2 million on electric buses, but we've got 10,000 homeless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5166)|
| 1:26:15| You are getting ready to tear down Austin Homes projects, and we don't even know where those people are going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5175)|
| 1:26:21| Where are those people going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| Because those 4,500 units, I'm still waiting on them, Madeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| So where are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Still waiting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| So you want to continue to spend these trends at the rate that you're spending at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| You know, what we talk about, I can name numerous amounts of money being blown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| We just went to the Chihauahe Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| $200,000 was spent on a firm out of Atlanta to come here and draw pictures that you could have went down the streets of University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5198)|
| 1:26:46| the architect and graphic design department, and got for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| That was a waste of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| Or do you want me to keep going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| How about the $130,000 that we have spent so far on the traffic observation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| Waste of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| Or what about the $120,000 that we spent on bulletproof vests for the fire department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| Waste of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| Do I need to keep going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| Last time I checked, someone else was yelling out how I am misinforming the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| Are these misinformed numbers that I've been giving out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| Because I can tell you where to find them at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| You can find them at your local city government budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| They've listed for us to look at for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| So if this is misinformed information, that means that the city is responsible for misinforming the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| And then I sit up here and I listen to comments made by people on our council that makes, to me, very discriminatory comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5244)|
| 1:27:32| You know, last time I sat in here, I watched the park and rec come in here that particularly dealt with the lawn care service talk about losing a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5252)|
| 1:27:40| And Councilman Wallace made sure to identify, number one, that it was a minority business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5260)|
| 1:27:46| and number two, that the reason why the minority business was losing the contract was because of poor performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| I felt like what was the necessity of identifying minority, period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| Bad business is bad business whether it's black or white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| So I don't need an identification of minority versus non-minority to determine if it's bad business or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| It's based off of customer service and treatment from the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| So it comes back to the greater message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| Soon, very soon, many of you all will be replaced, and I look forward to saying goodbye and good riddance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5287)|
| 1:28:13| because I am so looking forward to the CCM walking in this door, taking this oath, and taking these seats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5293)|
| 1:28:19| and giving the people voice back to us once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| So, Knoxville, the statement still remains the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| Get to the voting booths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| As has already been stated, we are in election right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| Early vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5311)|
| 1:28:32| Vote, vote, vote, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| And these numbers have been record-breaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| They have been coming in already for early vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| We're already roughly about 5,000 people already stepping out to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| And I say, Knoxville, keep voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191022?start=5320)|
