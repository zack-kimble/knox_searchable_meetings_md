| 7:09:45| and we want to add city staff or departments on behalf of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25785)|
| 7:09:50| the city-appointed stakeholder advisory committee, or continue what's in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25790)|
| 7:09:58| the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25798)|
| 7:10:00| also require an application that are exempt from fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25800)|
| 7:10:03| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25803)|
| 7:10:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25804)|
| 7:10:05| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25805)|
| 7:10:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25806)|
| 7:10:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25807)|
| 7:10:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25808)|
| 7:10:10| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25810)|
| 7:10:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25812)|
| 7:10:13| Any questions on 16-2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25813)|
| 7:10:20| The addition of F, that's the current code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25820)|
| 7:10:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25823)|
| 7:10:24| I guess I just had a question on do we think it's important to still have that 120-day requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25824)|
| 7:10:29| and what's the thought there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25829)|
| 7:10:34| Because sometimes that has put sort of a burden on this body to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25834)|
| 7:10:39| when sometimes the neighborhood and the business is working on things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25839)|
| 7:10:42| and then there's this 120-day sort of time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25842)|
| 7:10:45| It's always felt artificial to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25845)|
| 7:10:47| I see Mr. Frost ready to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25847)|
| 7:10:51| but I would say the purpose is to put a burden on the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25851)|
| 7:10:54| and make sure you move forward with these requests for zoning changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25854)|
| 7:11:01| to ensure that the applicant is provided a final resolution to their request in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25861)|
| 7:11:09| It gives some finality to someone so it doesn't keep getting postponed and postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25869)|
| 7:11:15| and it becomes a war of attrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25875)|
| 7:11:17| So, I mean, tinker with it a number of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25877)|
| 7:11:19| but I'd respectfully submit there needs to be some sort of time limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25879)|
| 7:11:23| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25883)|
| 7:11:25| Otherwise, you end up with the petitioner being in Never Never Land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25885)|
| 7:11:29| and he can just be held up forever without even being able to go on to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25889)|
| 7:11:38| So I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25898)|
| 7:11:40| If it's not 120 days, make it, you know, 130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25900)|
| 7:11:43| But I think it's important that they have to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25903)|
| 7:11:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25907)|
| 7:11:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25908)|
| 7:11:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25909)|
| 7:11:50| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25910)|
| 7:11:52| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25912)|
| 7:11:53| I saw Rob's light, but I anticipated yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25913)|
| 7:11:55| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25915)|
| 7:11:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25917)|
| 7:11:59| Starting with page 16-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25919)|
| 7:12:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25922)|
| 7:12:03| Which is this chart you guys here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25923)|
| 7:12:07| And there are several of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25927)|
| 7:12:09| If you look at file your application, then there's a completeness review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25929)|
| 7:12:12| Then it goes to KKCP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25932)|
| 7:12:14| That's what I'm calling you guys, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25934)|
| 7:12:17| Anyway, going down, you've got your bubbles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25937)|
| 7:12:19| Recommend approval, recommend approval, modifications, recommend denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25939)|
| 7:12:23| The recommend denial, the line, once something gets denied by MPC or KKCP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25943)|
| 7:12:33| it doesn't come to counsel, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25953)|
| 7:12:35| It dies on the vine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25955)|
| 7:12:37| So the diagram shows it coming to counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25957)|
| 7:12:42| The lines go from the circle that says recommend denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25962)|
| 7:12:45| It just keeps moving down the chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25965)|
| 7:12:49| Yeah, and it's those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25969)|
| 7:12:51| I don't know, Christina, if you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25971)|
| 7:12:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25973)|
| 7:12:54| Are you talking about right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25974)|
| 7:12:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25975)|
| 7:12:56| Don't they need to go away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25976)|
| 7:12:57| It would go away unless there's an appeal of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25977)|
| 7:12:59| So what we have to show is that it dies there unless there's an appeal to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25979)|
| 7:13:05| I think that's what that line kind of presumes is that the next path forward would be an appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25985)|
| 7:13:10| which would, of course, go to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25990)|
| 7:13:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25993)|
| 7:13:14| So there's nothing anywhere here about appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25994)|
| 7:13:16| Let me just also point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25996)|
| 7:13:18| So that's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25998)|
| 7:13:19| Do we need to add something that indicates appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25999)|
| 7:13:22| This is where you would appeal, then, if in denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26002)|
| 7:13:25| So the appeals will be covered in Section 16.12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26005)|
| 7:13:30| As you can imagine, you know, updating these images to try to capture every single scenario is kind of tricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26010)|
| 7:13:40| That being said, though, I think we're open to suggestions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26020)|
| 7:13:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26025)|
| 7:13:46| Well, the same thing on chart page 16.23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26026)|
| 7:13:50| Those also for plan development, recommend denial, keeps on coming to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26030)|
| 7:13:57| I mean, you might be able to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26037)|
| 7:13:59| Why don't you look at that, see whether we can say if appealed, and then it shows going down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26039)|
| 7:14:05| Again, these are meant as general information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26045)|
| 7:14:10| Read the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26050)|
| 7:14:18| It's appealable to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26058)|
| 7:14:21| So we need to indicate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26061)|
| 7:14:22| You need it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26062)|
| 7:14:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26063)|
| 7:14:25| Let's ask staff to look at making that clear on this, that after recommended denial, that it could be appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26065)|
| 7:14:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26076)|
| 7:14:37| And if that line is going to go down there, it needs to show that that's based on an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26077)|
| 7:14:42| Every applicant is notified they have to appeal it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26082)|
| 7:14:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26086)|
| 7:14:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26087)|
| 7:14:48| So they can't rely on this chart and say, well, I just thought it automatically went to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26088)|
| 7:14:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26093)|
| 7:14:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26094)|
| 7:14:55| But still, the whole purpose of the chart is to kind of help you be able to look and see kind of what that process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26095)|
| 7:14:59| So can we just ask staff to review this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26099)|
| 7:15:01| And that would be something to bring back, determine if there's a way to show that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26101)|
| 7:15:05| We'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26105)|
| 7:15:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26106)|
| 7:15:07| That's page 16-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26107)|
| 7:15:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26109)|
| 7:15:10| We will bring back some ideas for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26110)|
| 7:15:12| What's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26112)|
| 7:15:20| Page 16-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26120)|
| 7:15:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26122)|
| 7:15:26| 16 for the special use review, formally known as a use-only review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26126)|
| 7:15:35| We have parts of the current code in here, but then didn't bring in everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26135)|
| 7:15:42| So we've got the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26142)|
| 7:15:48| We've got the procedure for authorizing uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26148)|
| 7:15:52| Okay, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26152)|
| 7:15:53| Let me turn it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26153)|
| 7:15:56| We've left out part of it is the rationale from the current existing code under Part B, uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26156)|
| 7:16:06| If you keep going down, it's the application, the public hearing, the restrictions, the approval or denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26166)|
| 7:16:12| We don't provide a rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26172)|
| 7:16:15| So in the current code, it says the rationale for planning commission approval, conditions or denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26175)|
| 7:16:19| including substantive factual statements of necessity, appropriateness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26179)|
| 7:16:23| or the adverse impact shall be included in the minutes of the planning commission meeting where decisions are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26183)|
| 7:16:29| It's like we've left out the part that gives you something to hang your hat on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26189)|
| 7:16:42| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26202)|
| 7:16:43| I'll have to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26203)|
| 7:16:47| It's missing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26207)|
| 7:16:50| This is under which subsection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26210)|
| 7:16:53| 16.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26213)|
| 7:16:55| We have purpose, initiation, authorization, procedure, conditions, standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26215)|
| 7:17:02| In Part A, I think something might be missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26222)|
| 7:17:09| Maybe that's the part you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26229)|
| 7:17:12| If I could speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26232)|
| 7:17:13| I think the entire excerpt, it's Article 7, Section 5, procedure for authorizing, uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26233)|
| 7:17:26| That whole section is missing B from the existing ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26246)|
| 7:17:31| And as Councilwoman Ryder pointed out, one very important section that is included in this one page that's missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26251)|
| 7:17:40| The rest of the section from the present ordinance was incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26260)|
| 7:17:44| This section was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26264)|
| 7:17:46| And we think it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26266)|
| 7:17:48| What Councilwoman Ryder read regarding the necessity of putting into the minutes the rationale for approving or denying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26268)|
| 7:17:56| especially denying, a special use, use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26276)|
| 7:18:00| It's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26280)|
| 7:18:01| I think it informs the public that Council and MPC has less leeway, less discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26281)|
| 7:18:13| when considering uses permitted on review as opposed to a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26293)|
| 7:18:19| And this directs the public, and I think the commissioners and everyone, that they need to have a foundation for their denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26299)|
| 7:18:29| They can't just say they have some fears or some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26309)|
| 7:18:33| And they need to get in the record where it doesn't meet the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26313)|
| 7:18:37| And so we would ask that the missing section from existing ordinance, Article 7, Section 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26317)|
| 7:18:43| procedures authorizing uses permitted on review, also be considered for incorporation into the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26323)|
| 7:18:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26330)|
| 7:18:51| So that was just inadvertently left out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26331)|
| 7:18:54| Is that or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26334)|
| 7:18:56| I frankly doubt that that was inadvertently left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26336)|
| 7:18:59| I rather suspect that that was deliberately left out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26339)|
| 7:19:02| because what you're saying there is that the person who is preparing the minutes as a result of this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26342)|
| 7:19:11| has to put together some statement of rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26351)|
| 7:19:15| And I've tried a lot of these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26355)|
| 7:19:19| And courts don't really require you to have some formalized statement of rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26359)|
| 7:19:24| What they do require you to have is you have to have a rational basis for what you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26364)|
| 7:19:30| and that rational basis has to appear in the record somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26370)|
| 7:19:34| So what happens is you get the minutes from MPC included in the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26374)|
| 7:19:40| and you get the entire transcript from the city council meeting included in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26380)|
| 7:19:45| And the court has to be able to discern from reviewing both the everything that was said at the city council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26385)|
| 7:19:53| the MPC minutes, the professional staff's recommendation, all of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26393)|
| 7:19:58| the court has to be able to discern from that record the basis upon which it was either granted or denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26398)|
| 7:20:05| whatever the subject may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26405)|
| 7:20:08| As long as the court can do that, can discern from what's in the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26408)|
| 7:20:12| then I've never seen a written statement of rationale that's been prepared by whoever it is who prepares the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26412)|
| 7:20:23| What really happens is the whole record goes up, and the court's got to discern from that record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26423)|
| 7:20:29| whether or not it may be upheld or not upheld because of appropriate reasons for what the lower body did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26429)|
| 7:20:38| And for the record, how many years have you done this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26438)|
| 7:20:41| Oh, gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26441)|
| 7:20:43| Forty now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26443)|
| 7:20:45| And I'm trying to think of the use of reviews that have been denied by the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26445)|
| 7:20:53| and there aren't many, but the minutes do not address rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26453)|
| 7:20:57| Gosh, we don't comply with this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26457)|
| 7:21:00| Never have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26460)|
| 7:21:01| I rely on the approach that Mr. Swanson mentioned, that there's a brief statement in the minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26461)|
| 7:21:09| there's a staff report, there's a transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26469)|
| 7:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26473)|
| 7:21:14| Can we change minutes then to record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26474)|
| 7:21:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26477)|
| 7:21:19| Would that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26479)|
| 7:21:21| And where is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26481)|
| 7:21:24| This would be in article existing, Article 7, Section 5, Procedures for Authorizing Uses Permit on Review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26484)|
| 7:21:33| and it's more than one thing, this entire thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26493)|
| 7:21:37| That's just the one passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26497)|
| 7:21:39| And if changing it to record rather than minutes is better, then we certainly would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26499)|
| 7:21:51| But that didn't really move over to this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26511)|
| 7:21:54| I mean, that's what a court's going to require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26514)|
| 7:21:58| Okay, and what we're saying is we think it would be very nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26518)|
| 7:22:02| because this informs the public that they have to provide a record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26522)|
| 7:22:09| I understand it would be nice, but it's never happened in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26529)|
| 7:22:12| and you would have to have someone who has the ability to put together sort of a synopsis of the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26532)|
| 7:22:24| And the person who prepares the minutes of one of these public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26544)|
| 7:22:28| doesn't prepare a synopsis of a rationale of what the body did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26548)|
| 7:22:32| It just says what they said and what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26552)|
| 7:22:34| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26554)|
| 7:22:35| I'm saying change it from minutes to record so that it informs the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26555)|
| 7:22:40| that they need to get material into the record, like strike minutes and use record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26560)|
| 7:22:51| I'm not sure we left out a section on purpose, to tell you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26571)|
| 7:22:54| I mean, that's just the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26574)|
| 7:22:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26577)|
| 7:22:58| So it would have been in there before, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26578)|
| 7:23:00| I mean, there's a provision that provides for an appeal to the court, and that's what the court requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26580)|
| 7:23:06| It's appealed by a writ of certiorari,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26586)|
| 7:23:10| and what a writ of certiorari requires the city recorder to do is to prepare the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26590)|
| 7:23:19| put all that stuff together, and send it to the court with an affirmation that this is the record from what happened below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26599)|
| 7:23:27| So you're finding it just like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26607)|
| 7:23:30| I am, because I know how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26610)|
| 7:23:33| But I understand what Ms. Malone is saying about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26613)|
| 7:23:38| You know, you don't see there something that says this is how you're going to inform the public what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26618)|
| 7:23:44| But what the public's really going to have to do in order to find out what happened is get a copy of the minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26624)|
| 7:23:51| and see what the minutes say and look at all those other documents that accompany those minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26631)|
| 7:23:56| such as the recommendations of the professional planning staff and the transcript, if it's available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26636)|
| 7:24:04| of both the city council meeting and or the MPC, or whatever it's called now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26644)|
| 7:24:14| I'm sorry, I can't remember what it's supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26654)|
| 7:24:16| I can't half the time either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26656)|
| 7:24:19| So what you're, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26659)|
| 7:24:21| I'm going to drop this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26661)|
| 7:24:22| It's in Article 7, Section 5, Part 4, and it's the rationale for planning commission approval, conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26662)|
| 7:24:31| or denial including substantive factual statements of necessity and appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26671)|
| 7:24:37| or of adverse impact shall be included in the minutes of the planning commission meeting where decisions are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26677)|
| 7:24:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26683)|
| 7:24:44| You're saying we're not bringing that over, and in your opinion, your legal opinion, we don't need it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26684)|
| 7:24:50| though we've always had it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26690)|
| 7:24:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26691)|
| 7:24:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26692)|
| 7:24:53| Although we've never done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26693)|
| 7:24:54| You've never done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26694)|
| 7:24:55| Oh, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26695)|
| 7:24:56| The minutes are very, now, very succinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26696)|
| 7:25:01| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26701)|
| 7:25:03| Who seconded the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26703)|
| 7:25:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26708)|
| 7:25:09| Then the one other thing I'll bring up is if you look at the process, 16-4 and 16-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26709)|
| 7:25:16| and then you look at the table on 16-6, currently now in the current code, Step Number 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26716)|
| 7:25:24| City Council Review of Action of Commission, that is now also gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26724)|
| 7:25:30| So it doesn't come to council anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26730)|
| 7:25:33| Use of review has never come to council except on appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26733)|
| 7:25:40| Is this only for, this is in Article 7, Section 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26740)|
| 7:25:45| Procedure for Considering Subdivisions, Development Plans, and Uses on Review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26745)|
| 7:25:50| within South Waterfront Zoning Districts, Overlay Districts, and Other Districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26750)|
| 7:25:55| Requiring Design-Related Plan Review, and it's Part B, Uses Permitted on Review, Step 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26755)|
| 7:26:03| Application, Step 2, Public Hearing, Number 3, Restrictions, Number 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26763)|
| 7:26:07| Approval or Denial, the part that you said that doesn't go in the minutes, Number 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26767)|
| 7:26:11| Effective Date of Approval, Issuance of Permit, Number 6, Validity of Plans, Number 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26771)|
| 7:26:16| Time Limit and Notification, Number 8, City Council Review of Action of Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26776)|
| 7:26:22| Agree if any section may petition the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26782)|
| 7:26:25| Okay, so this is just for a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26785)|
| 7:26:29| Or it could be if someone challenges the approval, they could appeal that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26789)|
| 7:26:36| And all of that has been deleted, is the point, including the section regarding the minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26796)|
| 7:26:42| which probably should say record, in agreement with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26802)|
| 7:26:46| I think it's informative to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26806)|
| 7:26:49| And if the public doesn't know when they are going to a meeting regarding a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26809)|
| 7:26:55| that they need to get material in the record, reading the minutes after the meeting is not a help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26815)|
| 7:27:01| They need to know in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26821)|
| 7:27:03| And, again, we would ask that you consider including that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26823)|
| 7:27:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26827)|
| 7:27:09| Also, I mean, I think if we're going to have the appeals in one of the diagrams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26829)|
| 7:27:15| then we should look into having appeals in the other diagrams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26835)|
| 7:27:19| Doesn't that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26839)|
| 7:27:22| You mean the previously we said that should add the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26842)|
| 7:27:25| These lines in the 16-3, some of those are appeal lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26845)|
| 7:27:31| In 16-6, there's no appeal lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26851)|
| 7:27:34| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26854)|
| 7:27:35| We're going to look at all the diagrams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26855)|
| 7:27:36| I think that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26856)|
| 7:27:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26857)|
| 7:27:38| All the images.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26858)|
| 7:27:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26861)|

| 7:27:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26868)|
| 7:27:50| I do want to bring up on page 16-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26870)|
| 7:27:58| This has to do with special use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26878)|
| 7:28:01| If you look at H, expiration, delete section H, and then the subsection I now becomes H for appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26881)|
| 7:28:11| And that's because this is addressed already in Article 15.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26891)|
| 7:28:15| And this just removes a duplication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26895)|
| 7:28:19| Move to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26899)|
| 7:28:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26900)|
| 7:28:21| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26901)|

| 7:28:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26904)|
| 7:28:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26905)|
| 7:28:27| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26907)|
| 7:28:29| My next one is page 16-8 unless there's one before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26909)|
| 7:28:33| I have two things on page 16-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26913)|
| 7:28:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26915)|
| 7:28:36| Page 16-7, section 16-3 for variances, part E as an elephant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26916)|
| 7:28:44| The word three in the final line needs to be struck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26924)|
| 7:28:48| It was originally three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26928)|
| 7:28:50| Now it's five things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26930)|
| 7:28:51| If you strike the word three, you're fine with all of the following criteria because there's five criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26931)|
| 7:28:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26939)|
| 7:29:00| So just striking the word three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26940)|
| 7:29:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26942)|
| 7:29:05| That's page 16-7 under E, standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26945)|
| 7:29:11| That's a typo basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26951)|
| 7:29:13| It says the Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize a variance from the strict application of this code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26953)|
| 7:29:18| so as to relieve such difficulties of hardship only in accordance with all of the following criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26958)|
| 7:29:25| It says three, but they're actually five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26965)|
| 7:29:27| So we just strike the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26967)|
| 7:29:30| Good catch again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26970)|
| 7:29:32| So there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26972)|
| 7:29:33| Was there a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26973)|
| 7:29:34| I think Marshall did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26974)|
| 7:29:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26975)|
| 7:29:36| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26976)|
| 7:29:37| It's a cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26977)|
| 7:29:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26978)|
| 7:29:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26979)|
| 7:29:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26980)|
| 7:29:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26981)|
| 7:29:43| Another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26983)|
| 7:29:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26984)|
| 7:29:46| And I think I was getting myself confused with the other section, but I think this part's pretty important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26986)|
| 7:29:51| Section 16-3 for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26991)|
| 7:29:54| Most of this is brought over from the current Article 7, Section 2 for variances and the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=26994)|
| 7:30:03| You've got Part E, which is the standards for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=27003)|
| 7:30:06| It does not bring over the requirements for granting of a variance, which is how you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=27006)|
