| 0:00:00| I'll go ahead and call this city of Knoxville workshop to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=0)|
| 0:00:12| We'll have the invocation by Mayor Brown and the pledge by Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=12)|
| 0:00:22| Let's bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=22)|
| 0:00:23| Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this, another beautiful day that you have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=23)|
| 0:00:29| We ask that we would go through these proceedings with a good mind and a good heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=29)|
| 0:00:37| We pray for all of those who are less fortunate in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=37)|
| 0:00:42| Thank you for our police and our firemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=42)|
| 0:00:45| Thank you for our soldiers who are overseas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=45)|
| 0:00:49| These and other blessings we ask in your name, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=49)|
| 0:00:53| Let us pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=54)|
| 0:01:00| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=60)|
| 0:01:11| Ms. Wilson, if you'll call the roll please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=83)|
| 0:01:24| Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| First off, I would just like to take a personal point for, and just, Councilman Wallace could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=92)|
| 0:01:40| not be here this evening, and he has been involved in this process from the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=100)|
| 0:01:48| It's just part of being a part-time legislator that sometimes things come into play to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=108)|
| 0:01:54| it's just impossible to make every meeting that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=114)|
| 0:01:57| But he was truly sorry that he could not make this and very upset that he couldn't be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| this evening, and it's certainly not a reflection of him not being interested in this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| because, as you all know, he's been attending, his attendance has been practically 100% at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| So, with that being said, we will start the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| First, we're going to have Tenova to present for 20 minutes, and then we'll have the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| to present for 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=139)|
| 0:02:27| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Well, hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Let me just finish with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| And then what we have on the agenda, we'll have three speakers, five minutes each on each side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=151)|
| 0:02:40| and then we'll take it from there from that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| So I'll recognize Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| I have a couple of issues that are coming up at City Council on Tuesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| I want to report to my colleagues that I've been in conversation with both sides of these rezoning issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=170)|
| 0:02:57| both the neighborhood groups and the attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| And what we would like to do, and I will bring this forward on Tuesday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| is the town center and North Shore Town Center rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| We're going to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| We just got some information from the developer today, but due to Labor Day weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| it's going to be difficult to meet with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| And so both sides have agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| Also, the Westland Morrell rezoning on the corner there, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| we are trying to get the neighborhood groups and the developer together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| and we'd like to postpone that for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| And the third one, which is the property on Dean Hill by Rufus Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| in working with them, they're looking at some possible changes there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| and would like to postpone that for eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| So everything that you took care of while I was gone is being postponed once again on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| So I just want to let you all know on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| Now a four-day weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| Now a four-day weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| So thank you, colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| And all that is just a proposal, and we'll have to deal with that in an official vote come Tuesday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| So with that, I'll turn it over to Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| You've got 20 minutes starting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| My name is Melanie Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| I'm AVP of Business Development with Tenova Healthcare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| and I appreciate the opportunity that you're giving us to explain our project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| And we'll be talking about not only the details of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| but also some of the decision-making that went into the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| and hope that we leave you with a good understanding of where we're coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| as an organization relative to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| Physicians Regional Medical Center, also known formally as St. Mary's Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| has a very long and rich history here in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| It's been around for over 80 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| It was founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1930,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| and that established a culture of compassionate care that we believe is unequaled in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| We have a very clinically excellent hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| We have the most highly ranked joint replacement program in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| in terms of quality measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| We were designated by Aetna as a healthy baby site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| We're not talking about a hospital that is in distress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| either from a clinical or a financial standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| But we are a clinically excellent, architecturally challenged facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| Our facility dates from the original structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| It was built in 1930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| It was added to through the decades until the 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| It's extremely difficult to access and navigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| We have done studies of challenges around how could we reconfigure the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| in order to meet the needs of health care in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| I think we all know you can't pick up a newspaper or watch a news report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| without seeing that health care and the way that we deliver health care is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| And it's not the same as it was in 1930 or 1940 or 1960 or 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| And we are trying to position ourselves to be ready to meet the challenges of the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| We have a great hospital today, but it cannot service the way that it has for the next 80 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=368)|
| 0:06:15| So we're trying to make sure that we're ready for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| Just to give you a visual, the next slide is just going to show you the facility today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| It's difficult to see out here because it's a little dim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| But those of you who can see it on your screen, you're going to see facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| that are put together on a hillside, very hard to find your way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| As we look at sick patients trying to make their way through the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| this is a 1.5 million square foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| And as we look at how health care is changing, it's becoming much more ambulatory in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| driven by outpatient visits, shorter hospital stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| People don't have a week any longer to learn their way through the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| They're in and out very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| Access is key and efficiency is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| We're being paid in different ways than we were in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| We're driving toward quality models, efficiency models, low cost, high quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| And as we talk about our employees transporting patients around a facility like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| getting supplies from one end to the other, this is a very challenging situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| And it will get tougher for hospitals, not easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| The other key component in this decision-making process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| is the relationship that we have with our medical staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| Physicians and hospitals work synergistically together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| Not all physicians are employed by hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| In fact, most are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| Physicians decide where they want to treat their patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| And physicians are voting with their feet on our campus, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| Over the last couple of decades, we have watched a gradual emptying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| of the physician office buildings on the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| So physicians, even if they're still doing surgery there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| many of them no longer practice on the hospital campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| And there's a list of the specialty groups that have actually left the campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| to do their business elsewhere and to take care of the patients elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| from an office standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| So again, we're still a busy hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| But our physicians have clearly communicated to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| that they need a different solution that will help them stay competitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| not just the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| So we looked at a number of alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| When Health Management purchased Mercy Health System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| from Catholic Health Partners, we knew, we had known for a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| that we had this challenge looming up ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| And we had done some initial analysis of how to resolve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| But Health Management's commitment, when they purchased Mercy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| of a minimum of $180 million of capital to be invested in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| over the next five years, we knew that we had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| to make the right decisions for the long term for the health system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| And so we looked at four different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| One was just the status quo, continue to do what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| at Physicians Regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| Frankly, that is not an option that's acceptable to our medical staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| And that is an option that leads to a very bad scenario in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| We are gradually going to see a deterioration of that hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| that is going to be financially unsustainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| and it's going to wind up in a very bad situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| both for that neighborhood and for Knoxville itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| Hospitals help drive the economy of this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| and we want ours to be strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| So we want to tackle this problem while we're still strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| Status quo plus was to try to do refurbishment or additions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| a new tower, some sort of solution from a facility perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| on the current site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| The next option that we considered was a phased move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| of the facility essentially up to our North Knoxville Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| I do want to remind City Council that while there's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| a lot of discussion of Tenova abandoning North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| Tenova has invested about $150 million in North Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| at North Knoxville Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| So we looked at could we move our services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| to North Knoxville Medical Center and make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| our tertiary medical center, which would still leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| the Physicians Regional Campus that is in place today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| looking at the same kind of situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| that we're considering here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| And then Replacement Hospital, which is to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| a replacement hospital in a location that best meets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| the needs of our patients that come to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| not only from the neighborhood around the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| but from an 11-county region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| while leaving some level of health services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| at Physicians Regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| So this is a very simple view of a very complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| decision-making process that we undertook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| but when we looked at the real factors that drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| our ability to meet the needs of our patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| to meet the needs of our physicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| and to be successful as an organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| both financially from a patient satisfaction standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| and in this community, we looked at these key drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| and what we saw was that the status quo option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| really doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| The status quo plus option really doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| The phased move north is slightly better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| but really doesn't work and solve the fundamental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| challenges that we have, and that a replacement hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| is the one solution that we believe will carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| the health system into the future and for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| 80 to 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| So as we considered a replacement hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| we looked around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| We found 107 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| We acquired an option on that acreage on Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| for a potential replacement hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| This location is very attractive to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| It's attractive for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| First of all, it is very accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| easily accessible from the travel routes that go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| both north and south, as well as east-west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| and that touch the 11 counties where our patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| primarily come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| The other significant advantage to that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| is that it's directly across the street from where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| many of the physicians on our medical staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| had already chosen to move their offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| which is the Dow Springs development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| This actually keeps the cost of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| more reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| We have to build less medical office building space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| because many of those physician practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| are already co-located next to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| So where are we now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| Of course, as you know, we're in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| of the rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| We have additional approval processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| after this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| Rezoning is just step number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| Then we go through use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| And then there's a state-level review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| which I know all of you are familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| which is the Certificate of Need process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| where we will have to demonstrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| that there's a need for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| that it's economically feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| and that it's in the interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| of the orderly development of health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| Those are high hurdles to cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| We've looked at this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| We believe that we meet those requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| but there's a whole other body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| that will look at that in great detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| after this rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| This is just phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| Architects and engineers have completed site analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| They have completed initial building plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| Many of you have seen what their work has been to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| And we've solicited a lot of input from key stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| So let's talk about the site just for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| This is a little hard to see up on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| but as most folks here have seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| this is a conceptual rendering of the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| as it will lay on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| The really key points here of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| and the layout of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| are that we are building as close to Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| as we can, as is feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| We're building as far away from homes as is feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| There's a creek running through the middle of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| and as you are aware at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| we've asked you to consider rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| of the property that is closest to Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| on the north side of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| The north side of the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| is currently zoned agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| as is the south side of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| We're asking for O-1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| I would like to point out, and we have maps up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| for the one-year and the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| I'm not going to sort of bounce in front of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| but O-1 is already one of the approved zoning uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| for the property on the north side of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| We're asking you to rezone the north side of the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| in keeping with the one-year and the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| that you have already approved as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| We think it's an appropriate use for the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| As we look at the next drawing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| what you'll see is that the property that we've selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| is really part of what is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| a significant medical development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| a medical node, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Dallas Springs across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| the letters there, M-O-B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| stand for Medical Office Buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| There are significant numbers of medical office buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| There's the Proton Therapy Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| The one that's a little out of keeping with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| is the very large FBI office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| that's at the top of the hill there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| But we're already in a medical node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| So as we look to staying on that north side of the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| which is already, again, appropriate usage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| been designated through the one-year and the sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| we're simply asking for rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| that's in line with that use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| that was already deemed an appropriate way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| to move forward with development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| in this part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| The 44 acres, which are on the south side of the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| will remain zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| There will be no changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| And we'll talk about those 44 acres again in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| So in keeping with our goal here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| to listen to our stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| both our board of trustees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| our medical staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| as well as community leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| and members of the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| that are impacted by this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| we have participated in a great number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| of neighborhood meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| both in West Knoxville and North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| about 13 of them at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| We've met with city officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| We've met with a lot of interested parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| And we have heard people's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| I think we understand what those concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| And we are working diligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| to do everything that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| to have this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| address those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| in a way that meets the needs of all parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| We understand those primary concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| to be traffic, noise and lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| water, drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| some environmental concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Will there be appropriate resources for the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| And then, of course, significantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| what will the impact be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| to the existing hospital area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| So let's just take them one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| Concern of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Increasing neighborhood traffic in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| We know already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| that there is an existing traffic problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| The hospital will not create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| a traffic problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| But the neighborhood has certainly strongly expressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| and we understand the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| relative to traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| We were required to do a traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| for Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| and it indicates that the additional traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| that will be generated by the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| can be managed by making some changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| to Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| with acceleration and deceleration lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| coming into and out of the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| adding a left turn lane into the hospital entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| and then adding a traffic light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| at Dick Lonas Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| and synchronizing those traffic lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| One of the things that our traffic engineer noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| as part of that study is that the traffic lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| today are not synchronized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| properly, and that synchronizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| those traffic lights will help that flow of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| That's what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| were required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| But we want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| a good partner with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| and so we've communicated with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| repeatedly that we are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| interested in working with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| as they see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| solutions to traffic issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| that make sense and that would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| for the neighborhood, that we'd be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| in partnering with them to come back to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| and talk about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| It's become clear through the course of those discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| that it's difficult to reach a consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| as to what those solutions may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| and we need some expert assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Canova has gone to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| the mayor's office, and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| the help of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Christy Branscombe and Duane Greve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| we've gone to the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| to propose that we jointly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| expand the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| that we look at the neighborhood streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| that will be most impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| and that we do that in partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| We're waiting for a response from the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| office, and we'll know about that soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| But we are prepared to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| together toward finding solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| that make sense for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| and that we can agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Noise and lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| A couple of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| When the architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| who are very good architects and have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| healthcare experience, first came to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| with the design, the first thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| that the hospital CEO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| said was, you've got to flip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| this hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| The architect said, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| He's a great architect, but he said, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| if we can do that. We went to some neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| and the neighborhood member said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| we don't want an ER by our houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| We don't want your helipad by our houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| And we came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| and said, well, Karen had a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| but the neighborhood reinforced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| And we listened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Okay, thank you. I'll hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| So, ER has been flipped to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| as far as possible from the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| homes. There's over a football field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| of green space between the homes on the west side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| of the property and the closest parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| There are two to three football fields of distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| from the closest building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Lighting will be the latest technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| that will direct the lighting to where it's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| and not encroach on surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Next slide. Drainage environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| concerns, we're required to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| the stringent stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| requirements and we will do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| Forty-four acres of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| will remain zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| We have entered into initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| discussions with Legacy Parks Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| regarding the feasibility of placing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| a conservation easement on those forty-four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| acres. We don't have a final answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| on that yet, but we think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| could be a very good solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| for a way to preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| a significant amount of green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1211)|

| 0:20:15| relationship between the hospital and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| neighboring areas. We've also reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| to the City Parks and Recreation Department to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| propose that the walking trail through the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1221)|

| 0:20:27| is currently working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| Impacts to North Knoxville, and this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| very significant question, and I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| there are a lot of people who are very concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| We are too. We love that hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| We've been in that neighborhood for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| eighty-four years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| Planning is actively underway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| to reconfigure the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| that will be available at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| what is today Physicians Regional Medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| Center. I wish that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| more concrete answers about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| but we don't. And as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| can imagine, this is a very complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| planning process. We're reaching out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| to a number of potential partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| around both those healthcare services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| as well as non-healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| related kinds of administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| offices that could be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| at that facility. And the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| that we deal with the facility itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| will be heavily driven by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| the types of services that we're able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| engage there. Part of that planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| process is highly dependent on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| being able to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| through a timeline and not be delayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| indefinitely. Indefinite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| delays create more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| challenge around resolving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| the challenge for that campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| rather than making it easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| It makes it significantly harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| So quickly, I know I've got about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| two minutes left. Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Let me just talk to you a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| our timeline. And you'll see this on your screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| You have a handout of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| Essentially what this says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| is that we received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| a commitment for a minimum of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| $180 million of capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| starting October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| 1st of 2011. We went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| an internal planning process that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| significant that has resulted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| in obtaining the option for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| property. As we work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| through these processes including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| rezoning, certificate of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| need process, and construction process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| we think we're right at about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| the right point to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| utilize those funds in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| 2016. We want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| to use those funds in this community. We don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| to send those funds outside of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| This is phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| So we would ask you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| let us work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| phase one. We're committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| to finding the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| solution for the existing Physicians Regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Campus. We are highly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| committed to being good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| And this is just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| first step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1369)|
| 0:23:07| You have 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| Good afternoon, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Thank you for having this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| We appreciate this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| My name is Rocky Swingle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| I live at 7213 Sheffield Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| I represent Friends of Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| a group of Knoxvillians who opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| to NOVA's plans to replace the former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| St. Mary's Hospital with a new one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Some of them are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| I would like to ask them to stand up now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| and be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| And I believe three of them are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| to speak later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| My purpose is to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| why the Middlebrook property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| should not be rezoned from the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| Agriculture 1 or A1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| zone to an Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| 1 or O1 zone to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| a hospital. And that's the reason for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| the rezoning, to build a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| First, to NOVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| does not need to have the Middlebrook property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| rezoned in order to build their hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| The current A1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| zone permits hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| as a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| just as the proposed O1 zone does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| This is from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| the Zoning Regulations for A1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1462)|

| 0:24:26| Section C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| It reads, the following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| uses may be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1470)|

| 0:24:34| a cemetery, airport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| camp, hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| sanitarium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| and it goes on to list some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| under Article V Supplementary Regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| to NOVA would be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| to exceed the A1 height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| limitation. Section V| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| Paragraph B says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| churches, schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| hospitals, sanitariums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| may exceed the height limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| of the district if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| and then a formula is presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| that says that the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| have to be increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| as the building exceeds the permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| height. The formula is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| one foot of increased setback for every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| two feet of height above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| the maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| which is 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Given the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| on their conceptual plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| that would not appear to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| a hardship for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| There are no other A1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| rules that inhibit them from building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| what they've described so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| as their intended facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| The setbacks, lot coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1538)|

| 0:31:35| I would like to ask two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| physicians from our medical staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| to present, so we just have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1899)|
| 0:31:46| Your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1906)|

| 0:31:52| Thank you. I'm Leonard Brabson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| I live at 517 Cherokee Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| I've been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| citizen of Knoxville, lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| and worked here all my life, except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| for three years in Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| which wasn't a nice place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| but have lived in Knoxville for 65| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| years. I've worked at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| old St. Mary's, and most of us still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| call it that, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| I've worked there for 35| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| years. I deliver babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| I'll be back over there till midnight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| tonight, waiting on another baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| I've been in that hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| probably 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| days a year out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| any 365| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| The last 20 years, I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| the medical director of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| women's pavilion, and that's where we deliver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| I've probably delivered some babies in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| I hope you all turned out okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| I was sad to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| see, like a lot of us, the old St. Mary's name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| go. I was there 35| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| But over the last few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| years, the doctors have faced several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| disappointments. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| old system was lacking capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| and because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| money being spent on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| upkeep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| just painting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| and doing things that should have been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| just didn't get done as much as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| they used to before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| And then we went through three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| major plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| of what would happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| what might happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| And like everyone else, when HMA came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| the picture, all of us were a bit apprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| about what that would mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| But what it's meant for me is I still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| deliver babies every day. The nurses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| I work with still work there every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| doing their job. And the physicians I work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| with, day in and day out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| still do their job. Yes, it's true, a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| them have moved their offices to other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| It's pretty inconvenient for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| And if you're nine months pregnant coming to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| office and have to walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| parking garages away to come see me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| it's a bit of a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| It's been a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| for physicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| If I go from my office to the women's pavilion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| to deliver babies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| I go on three elevators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Hopefully none of them are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| malfunctioning when I'm in a rush to go deliver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| a baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| If someone asks me how to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| to the cafeteria from our women's pavilion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| I truthfully tell them it's better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| to get in your car, go down to Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| and go through one of the restaurants down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| because you can't get there from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| And that's just one of the minor inconveniences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| But I'm speaking to you from the physician's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| perspective because it's been said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| physicians weren't in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| And I will say, if there are any of those around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| I've not talked with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| Not only are they in favor of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| they're pretty excited about the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Today, David Harrell, a surgeon friend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| of mine, we were sitting waiting for a surgery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| case to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| He said, you know, I live in West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| and I understand everybody's concern there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| but he said, I think a hospital's a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| But besides, he's excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| I've seen the preliminary plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| I've been involved with giving advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| about what they might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| But we're excited to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| I will remind you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| and one of the other changes with HMA is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| we pay taxes now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| We're the only hospital in town that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| And I don't know the figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| Somebody at this table knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| but we paid lots of taxes last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| But to summarize, I've been a citizen here all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| I see this as a great change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Nobody wants to have something in their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| that's annoying. I wouldn't want that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| But I think it can happen without it being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| that big of an annoyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2141)|
| 0:35:55| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| I'm Dr. Frank Barline. I live at 12204| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| South North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| Dr. Bradsen got here asking if he wanted to go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| or me, and he said he had to go deliver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| so I get to kind of sweep up the ends here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| But what Dr. Bradsen said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| was absolutely true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| My main goal tonight is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| to tell you that I am actually a pathologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| I am a laboratory director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| of the Physician Regional Medical Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| and have been for the last 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| I've also been on the Medical Executive Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| for the last 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| A couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| I was elected as the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| of the Physician Leadership Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| Throughout this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| we've spent a lot of time trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| what is the best thing to do for the patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| for the physicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| for the hospital itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| I was there when we decided to build a north campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| And that had its own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| and its own goals to reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| The problem is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| since we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| actually became the Mercy System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| five years ago, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| in the recent past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| the physicians kept saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| we've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| The facility is old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| It's outlived basically its life expectancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| Laboratory, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| We've got instruments now that are the size of this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| We've got to put four of them in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| That hospital wasn't built for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| That's just in the chemistry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| We've got all kinds of other instruments we've got to put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| You've got radiology. You've got CT scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| They weren't planned for when the hospital was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Our new and modern technologies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| we had no place to put them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| The facility just won't handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| So we sat at the Physician Leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| Council primarily, and we looked at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| ideas that Melanie kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| voiced a few minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| about what can we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| Do we try to tear something down and rebuild it on site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Do we move north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| What can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| And through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| discussion, and actually a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| about the Physician Leadership Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| we had basically 12 physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| on that council, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| the job of that council is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| represent the different specialties in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| We had OB. We had anesthesia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| surgery, radiology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| just on down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| And we challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| those physicians to say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| we have a questionnaire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| And we developed some questions that say, go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| talk to your respective services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| your groups that you're a representative of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| and come back with some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| We can't just do status quo. We can't do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| The hospital climate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| changes so quickly now, we can't just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| sit by and watch and wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| and see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| So we came back, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| had a discussion with administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| from HMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| and basically kind of charged them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| and said, this is what needs to be done, and this is how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| we think it can happen. And it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| originally a physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| initiative to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| how about a replacement hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| And they went back. They tried to figure out other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| Came right down to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| The replacement hospital was the only real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| alternative, and it was the only one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| I'll tell you of the 12 members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| physicians on that committee who represented all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| the services of the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| everybody was in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| There's 450 people on the medical staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| at the Physician Regional Medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Center. Those are co-mingled with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| doctors throughout the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| Of the ones that are actively practicing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| there, I haven't talked to a single one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| yet who has opposed this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| They all think it's a great idea, and like Dr. Brabson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| said, they're all very excited to see this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2363)|
| 0:39:37| So now we'll go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| You got one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Okay, that's it. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| I'm A.B. Cleaforth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| 718 Westboro Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| part of West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| and Councilman Greaves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| District. I've been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Knoxville since 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| I'm a neurological surgeon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| and I've been in the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| almost as many days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| and nights as Dr. Brabson, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| We're on call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| 24-7, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| can tell you that from my house in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| West Hills to any of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| hospitals in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| and I've been on the staffs of all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| it's a 15-minute drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| at the worst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| except for Tennessee home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| games and ice storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| also during my time here, I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| Chief of Surgery, and I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| an officer of the medical staff at St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| I can tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| St. Mary's has been a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| hospital, and in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| it was my hospital of choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| to practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| I had a fantastic operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| room, fantastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| colleagues. We had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| a neurosurgery center of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| excellence with our own ICU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| our own ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| but there were some very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| poor decisions made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| by previous administrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| which drove many physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| away from the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| Included among those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| poor decisions was raising the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| rent in the adjoining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| office building, so physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| left to find cheaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| When my practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| had to leave, that downgraded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| St. Mary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| from a level two trauma center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| to a zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| So it lost all of its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| trauma coverage at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| and left UT Hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| as the only trauma center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| in town. So a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| administration, even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| without fancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| buildings, can make a tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| difference and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| can bring physicians back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| I know that during the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| I practiced there, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| had state-of-the-art operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| rooms. We had rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| taking place in patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| rooms to bring them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| to current codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| We had new services being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| developed, such as rehabilitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| such as women's services, such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| as an outpatient surgery center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| So all of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| are, in fact, possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| The old St. Mary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| has served many, many people from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| Knoxville, North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| Central Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| counties north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| of Knoxville and Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| and we had patients coming down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| from Kentucky and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| from Virginia to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| arrive at our hospital for care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| both emergent and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| elective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| sick patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| will find their way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Several people have alluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| to the complexity of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| current building, and yes, it is complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| but they have many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| volunteers and they have transporters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| who obviate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| need for patients to really find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| their way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| At one time, physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| were viewed as a source of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| income for hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| They were viewed as a source of patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| Then we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| changes in the medical care system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| and all of a sudden, physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| became viewed as expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| centers. Now maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| things are turning back around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| and the hospital is recognizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| that physicians do, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| bring patients in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| But I never had any patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| complain that St. Mary's was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| inaccessible to them, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| had patients from all over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| Knox County, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| other counties and other states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| I can speak very strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| from the standpoint as a neurosurgeon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| that these poor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| decisions by the previous administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| led to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| neurosurgery leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| St. Mary's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| and that subsequently made it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| virtually impossible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| for neurology to practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| at St. Mary's. And I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| heard that St. Mary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| tried to make them cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| three different emergency rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| You have one minute. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Which they said they could not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| So they left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| replacement hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| if, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| they feel it's absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| necessary, could be somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| else. Those of us in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| West Hills, and I noticed the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| speakers do not live in West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| feel that we don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| another hospital there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| We don't want another hospital there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| It is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| residential neighborhood, and we feel it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| should be limited to residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| We also feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| that St. Mary's should not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| abandon its North Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| patients, residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| and businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| You'll hear multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| reasons, traffic and noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| The hospital can't control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| and they're both going to affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| the quality of living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| in West Hills. So we ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| to reject this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| request to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| My name is John Neal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| I think you all probably remember getting a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| from me. I have a photograph I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| to share with you all, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Can I bring it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2736)|
| 0:45:48| Here, let me get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| You can take more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2750)|
| 0:46:04| My name is John Neal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| I live at 6657 Ridge Rock Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| and that means that I'm directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| affected by this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| because it's literally in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| When I'm in my backyard, I'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| looking down at the roof of this hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| And to make matters worse, my law office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| is across the street from them on Old Weisgarber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| So I'm doubly affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| I want to say first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| that I like Dr. Brabson and Dr. Brabson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| you delivered my first son about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| 34 years ago. You probably don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| remember it, but he did turn out okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| He got his M.D. a couple months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| So he's your kind of fella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| But I'm also going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| to say that at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| I lived out in Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| and we picked Dr. Brabson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| because he worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| at St. Mary's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| St. Mary's Hospital is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| to the people who live in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| It's not just important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| to North Knoxville, it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| to everybody up to Millsboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| You know, John King and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| were partners for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| We practiced law together for about 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| And now we find ourselves in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| adversarial position because John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| wants to park this hospital in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| Well, let's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| suppose the shoes were on the other foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| Let's suppose I represent Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| And the hospital, Tenova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| had decided they'd like to build a lovely new facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| on the shores of the Tennessee River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| and it bought up 100 acres in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| Mr. King's neighborhood over there on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| Blow Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| So Mr. King would be here instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| me. And what do you suppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| he'd be saying? He'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| saying this is about the worst idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| anybody ever had and a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| bad business decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| Mr. King would tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| that lives are going to be lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| because the folks who are in North Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| and in Millsboro and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| Claiborne County would now have to drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| an extra 15 or 20 minutes to a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| and that makes a heck of a lot of difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| to somebody who's having a heart attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Mr. King| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| would tell you that you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| well, Mr. King would tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| you should simply blow off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| this comment that quote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2886)|

| 0:48:10| He'd tell you that's a flat out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| misrepresentation. Tenova's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| been in North Knoxville about two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| when they bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| the failing St. Mary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| which was failing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| as Dr. Kleefos pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| because of mismanagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| Tenova is not our neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| Tenova is a Florida corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| and you know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Mr. King would tell you? He would tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| that you represent the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| voters of Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| He'd tell you you represent those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| in North Knoxville who are going to lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| the hospital they desperately need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| He'd tell you you represent the people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| West Knoxville who don't want this hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| He'd tell you you represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| the people that are going to have the helicopters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| flying over their houses and I'm sure I'm one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| You represent the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| who are going to be hearing sirens in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| backyard constantly and I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| And I might add it's going to have a side effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| that I'm going to have to listen to those coyotes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| every time a siren goes past my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| Mr. King would tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| that Tenova already has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| a beautiful facility on Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| It's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| beautiful facility. A couple of months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| my aunt who is 93| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| fell at the pinnacle and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| ambulance attendants asked me if they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| take her to that hospital and to be honest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| with you. You have one minute. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| I never even paid a moment of attention to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| hospital. So we spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| the weekend there because I'm her primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| caregiver and what I found was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| that beautiful facility was empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| It was so empty that I went and asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| the nurses on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| if there was anybody else in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| The cafeteria was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| empty. The parking lot was empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| The lobby was dark and there wasn't a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| soul at the front desk the entire weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| I was amazed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| And that picture you're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| I took that last Saturday afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| in the parking lot of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| hospital. Now I don't mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| to represent to you that there were no other cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| in that lot because there were. But you go over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| UT Hospital or go to Fort Sanders Hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| and try to find an empty space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Those places are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| packed. Tenova's got a beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| hospital now. It cannot fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| Mr. King would tell you this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| a bad business decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| It's bad for the voters of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| It's bad for the surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| And you all should deny this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3028)|

| 0:50:48| confused, who are not in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| of this rezoning. We stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| to lose the largest employer in North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| Knoxville that occupies over 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| acres off Woodland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| that's accessible from I-275| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| 75, I-40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| and Hall of Fame Drive, which by the way dumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| into a four-lane road with a turning lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3064)|

| 0:51:08| the hospital. It's adequate access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| North Knoxville has worked really hard to rebuild| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| and continues to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| I'm sure you're all quite familiar with some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3076)|

| 0:51:20| spending money on and continues to spend money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| on to try and revitalize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| Having a loss of this size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| would be substantial to our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| and we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| balance that kind of weight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3090)|

| 0:51:38| acres plus large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3098)|

| 0:52:08| They can have a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| in an A1 zone. They can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| get a Certificate of Need and they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3132)|

| 0:52:16| rezone this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3136)|

| 0:53:16| a hospital. Fisher Tires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3196)|

| 0:53:30| the hospital anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| I know a lot of people that ate in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| cafeteria at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| Tenova, or St. Mary's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| Mercy, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| were pretty sad to leave it in spite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| of how some people felt about the food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| So there were a lot of people I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| that could find the cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| I myself have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| One of my first trips to Knoxville, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| I didn't actually live here at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| it was a holiday, and I couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| find anything open, and my car was blocked in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| by a worker who didn't speak English at my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| construction project down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| because I renovated an old property. I do believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| that's feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| So I walked to the hospital. I'm very familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| hospitals. They have everything you need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| and I easily, with no one's help, found the cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| The florists, the restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| and many others are going to suffer greatly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| if this hospital moves, not to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| the impact of 20 underutilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| or vacant acres off woodland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| no contracts for what's going to happen on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| property. We have nothing but suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| maybe some promises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| some wishes, and some dreams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| Tenova says they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| a state-of-the-art facility in West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| for $250 to $300 million, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| is a number that's been thrown out on 60 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| They say they'd rather not spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| $80 to $90 million to renovate their existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| 20-acre campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| In an era of decreasing medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| reimbursement sequestration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| which led HMA Tenova| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| to cut staff vacation accrual, as reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| in the Knox New Sentinel, Medicare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| and Medicaid cuts, followed by private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| insurers that mimic those cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| That's what happens if you don't know about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| medical reimbursement works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| This is a government-regulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| industry. It's not a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| like any other that you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| It's strictly government-regulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| from the state level all the way to the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| I believe about 60% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| people hospitalized or use hospital services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| are using some form of government pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| This network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| will tell you they're stable, but I would question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| that, considering the buyout and all the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| things we keep reading about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| They want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| to spend $300 million on a new location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| to get excellent patient outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| With healthcare reimbursement in flux| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| and HMA's instability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| they would prefer not to spend $90 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| on an existing location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| I say let the state decide the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| certificate of need process, and we'll decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| the zoning part after they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| determined that we need a hospital off Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| and not on Woodland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| That would get us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| Councilman Dello. Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| I understand that there was one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| that came here. She was a nurse from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| Tenova for many years, or at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| St. Mary's, and she wanted to speak for about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| three minutes, Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| I would ask that we suspend the rules and allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| Okay, that's fine. But let me go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| and suggest that there, in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| to her. Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| I was signed up to. Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Are you passing me over, or do I need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| to come back at another? You'll hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| There's three others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| in addition to Ms. Davis, that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| signed up. Hear them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| Okay, three minutes apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| All in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| We're suspending the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| and that's the motion, and there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| And I would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| that you please say something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| different than what's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| Bring some new information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| and let's not regurgitate what's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| If there are three of us, it might be first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| or is someone else ahead of you? You would be first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, counsel, for hearing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| I'm here as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3435)|

| 0:57:31| I'm going to ask you to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| Please. You're out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| He is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| I am here as president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| of the West Hills Community Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| As I said, my name is Ruben Pelow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| and I live in West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| 8437 Cortland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| And the reason I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| requested to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| is that I wanted the council to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| that the West Hills Community Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| has not taken a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| either for or against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| the project that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Tenova has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| No Tenova signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| that you have seen in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| have come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| another source and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| West Hills Community Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| Within the West Hills Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Association, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| bordered by a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| boundary that was prescribed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| the City of Knoxville Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| in the 1970s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| and it still exists today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| and we are a legitimate organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| that is chartered with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| And so my reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| for being here is to tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| we are not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| taking a stand as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| community organization. Dr. Cleeth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| is correct. But I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| think I should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| the opportunity to tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| There are some organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| community organizations, homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| associations that are within our boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Wesley Neighbors is one, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| that was alluded to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| And they did take a vote about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| how they feel about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| And they are an organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| that is immediately impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| by this Tenova project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| because they are adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| As a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| homeowner myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| and as the community association president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| we have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| seen, heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| or been involved in anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| has promoted for or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| We had a meeting with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| executive committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| just last month, and a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| was not taken at that time simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| because there were too many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| But I would like for you to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| that Tenova has come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| to our association meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| from as early as back in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| and they talked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| our executive committee, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| talked with our general meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| attendees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| and they have done everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| that they had proposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| They've had one mess-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| and that was where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| they had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| to change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| significance of the scenic highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| that ran in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| of where the proposed project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| is on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| Now, that was a little disturbing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| to a lot of people that live within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| the West Hills community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| because that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| a direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| conflict with what they had told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| they would do because they had stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| that when we start this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| we will keep you totally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| informed. We won't do a thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| that you don't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| Well, when the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| changed the designation of the scenic highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| on Middlebrook Pike from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| Weisgarber Road westward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| to about Whitehall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| No one knew about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| You're going to have to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| Okay. One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| to say one more thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| That is one of the biggest issues that the community association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| and the people within the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| are concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| MPC has a certain requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| for traffic studies and projects like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| this, and I think that it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| alluded to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| TANOVA has already asked council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| to exceed that by doing an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| in-depth traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| that will be concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| the city streets within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| West Hills itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| We need to know that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| I hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| you all will take that into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| when you all are meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| and have to vote on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| Thank you for being here. I'd also like to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| former council persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3711)|

| 1:01:55| there. Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Commissioner Atlar Schaus was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| here earlier as well as Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| Broyles, so appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3721)|

| 1:02:13| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| Thank you for allowing me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| to speak. My name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| is Charlotte Davis. I reside at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| 104 Crawford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| I was employed as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| an RN at St. Mary's for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| 40 years, most of those years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| in a management position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| I want to address what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| I see as a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| problem if this zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| is approved, followed by the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| of yet another hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| The problem that I foresee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| is that folks who live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| counties to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| and northeast of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3769)|

| 1:03:35| it would be logical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| to think that this would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| or could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=3819)|

| 1:06:58| impacted by the proposed hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| and I want to talk from a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| points. First of all, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| recently delivered my 13-month-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4024)|

| 1:07:10| but it was empty. My father| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| died at the old St. Mary's. I had a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| experience there. They delivered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| fantastic care and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| the end-of-life care there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| remarkable. I had no problem finding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| bacteria there either, but what I want to focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| is jobs. I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4044)|

| 1:07:32| talking about an increase in jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| and I have concerns there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4054)|

| 1:07:48| yet to see a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| where you have this type of turmoil in a corporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4070)|

| 1:07:54| acquisition activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4074)|

| 1:07:58| in the higher paying jobs that you want to keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4078)|

| 1:08:10| that off the table. Construction jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| would be factored into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4092)|

| 1:08:24| We have to take that off the table because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| those construction jobs I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| When you look at the 75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| recent jobs that were lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| due to consolidation of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| offices by Tenova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| when you look at what other types of jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| are going to be seen as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| duplicative across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| new system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| I think we have to be careful about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| looking at promises of additional jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| Jobs are a pretty big key factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| for voters right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| I'll end with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| Please, please, don't vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| on this. Listen to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| We don't want this hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| It's not needed. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Thank you. I want to ask my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| because I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| I'll probably have to leave early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| And I want to ask Ms. Robertson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| a question on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| status quo plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| of building a new structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| where the existing hospital is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| Could you give us some numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| on the cost of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| I appreciate Ms. Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| has done a great job, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| in organizing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| communities around the existing hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| And we've met with that group a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| of times and have communicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| this as well. I think there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| misunderstanding in those numbers that I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| to correct here. The $80 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| that was referred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| is strictly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| related to work that would need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| done on infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| for the hospital. Boilers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| chillers, electrical upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| et cetera, in order to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| one, to replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| old, aged equipment, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| as to accommodate some of the upgraded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| power needs, et cetera, as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| move into the future of new technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| So $80 to $90 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| of investment before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| you see anything that looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| different in the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| that's all behind the scenes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| And then you look at how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| do we take the facility and create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| something that becomes much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| efficient. That's very key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| It is, yes, it's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| wayfinding and it's about sick patients trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| to find their way around the building. But the real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| challenge is how do we become as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| efficient as possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| And as we looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| at that, we came away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| with, between the $80| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| million of infrastructure work that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| required, the challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| of how do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| then do major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| renovation in a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| that is your tertiary medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| center? We're treating patients there all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| day, every day. Stopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| our business to do significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| renovations takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| us well beyond the capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| costs. We've estimated somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| in the neighborhood of $175| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| to $200 million of capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| that would need to be invested at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| But that doesn't take into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| account the business interruption that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| happens, the interruption in patient care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| and our inability to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| to care for patients in our hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| that is the key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| driver in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| patients and activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| for our system. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| And I have one other question. When you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| looked at other sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| and you sell it on the site on Millbrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| as the best site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| did you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| any sites in east Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| we have no hospital whatsoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| Haven't had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| Did you look at any sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| in east side of town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| What we looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| as we looked at the sites and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| I'll claim a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| challenge here and maybe somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| from our team was involved in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| in-depth going from site to site. I wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| involved in going from site to site so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| can't tell you exactly what sites were looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| at. But as we looked at the plans for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| where are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| demographics of Knoxville, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| have the population shifted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Where do our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| physicians want us to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| Where do their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| patients want to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| And as we look simply at the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| that's required in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| a hospital and accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| patterns in our town run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| as we know from east to west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| from north to south to west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| And so as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| looked at those they were just not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| deemed to be the most feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| area of town for a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| The other key benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| to this site as I mentioned before is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| its proximity to Dow Springs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| which does help us mitigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| some of the cost of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| because there are many physician practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| already located there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| will then be right across the street from the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| Let me ask you if you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| share with us what would be the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| two site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| If you have a number two site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| Don't have a number two site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| We believe this is the right site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| Yes, I know you're probably going to have to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| I think we're about to wrap it up anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| Okay, the physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| that was the chief of staff, is he still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| The gentleman, the neurosurgeon, I've forgotten his name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| Dr. Cleafoff, would you please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| I'm concerned because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| you made some good points and obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| you were in a position to not only do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| your own practice but to kind of supervise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| the practice at that hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| and so your observations I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| are helpful to us but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| I'm confused because I hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| Ms. Robinson tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| what she has and she has gone around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| to community groups and spoken to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| and been very open about that but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| there is other land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| near that property, maybe not currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| owned by Tenova but there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| ground level parking lots, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| neighborhoods with small houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| Is there any inhibition in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| mind to building a tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| or separate new structure there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| before they tackle the old building because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| we're constantly hearing the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| that we can't renovate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| old building, it's all a one piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| with systems and what not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| Can you see a separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| acute care unit being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| built there and then renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| taking its time next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| I'm just trying to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| how that would work with the convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| that doctors need to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| the right equipment and do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| modern surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| Yes sir, you make a very good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| and I would observe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| that in fact St. Mary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| did build two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| outbuildings if you will. One is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| Women's Center and the other is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| the Surgery Center which they built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| separate from the main hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| Secondly, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| rooms became antiquated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| some of those wings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| were turned into offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| so I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| suggest that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| a lot of administrators could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| be moved to offices in a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| place. That whole wing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| could either be raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| or gutted and new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| patient rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| or operating rooms or x-ray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| suites, whatever was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| the highest priority could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| built in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| to leave you with a misimpression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| I was not chief of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| but I was on the medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| I was a medical staff officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| I was chief of surgery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| and I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| a long time neurosurgeon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| on the staff at St. Mary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| and I'm still on the staff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| A second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| question would be what type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| of equipment or management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| changes do you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| that could make that hospital efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| again? In other words, you said there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| a decline in the last five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| to seven years as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| the hospital both lost money, changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| management several times. What would you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| that could be remedied that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| might return some of the viability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| that was there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| In the past, I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| administrators who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| were concerned enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| about medical practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| that they had lunch with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| the physicians in the physician's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| dining room. Interaction, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| Absolutely. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| that perhaps focus groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| that would revisit some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| issues to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| where needs exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| and how they might be restored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| would be very fruitful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| because administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| really, really lost its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| grounding and caused a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| of the problems which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| it has inherited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| And the final question, because I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| others have questions, is do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| see physicians that you work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| with as being resistant to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| in a location like that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| opposed to... I mean, I understand the idea is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| they want to build a new campus that's kind of laid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| out right at the outside and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| has got all the modern conveniences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| in the right spot. Do you see a resistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| with physicians you work with in returning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| to a hospital that was upgraded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| in St. Mary's location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| No, I don't. Dr. Brabson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| I believe related that there were 480| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| members on the medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| staff, and obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| no one has polled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| all of those members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| I can speak to that very affirmatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| Perhaps some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| individuals have approached the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| with their specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| wishes, but no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| has polled all of the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| to find out what their desires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| are. I believe there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| numerous physicians who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| appreciate St. Mary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| for its quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| its integrity, and its long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| history, and want to remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| exactly in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| There are physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| offices that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| exist around the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| where they have bought property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| built their own office buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| Those buildings that are on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| periphery, yes. Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| They would be far away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| from a new hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| Okay, well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| Councilman Greer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| A couple of questions. First of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| I want to say that I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| very much the civility between both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| the neighborhoods and Tenova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| and I want to commend both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| sides for the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| we have a number of zoning issues right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| in the 2nd District, and this has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| I think that both sides have been very open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| and I know I've been able to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| to both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| The question I have, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| this is really to Tenova. I know that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| architect is here, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| Ms. Robertson, you were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| about the $80 million that had to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| with the infrastructure that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| be spent first, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| one of the questions I have, and maybe the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| architect, if that's okay, can address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| Have you actually done studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| of the existing hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| in terms of what can and cannot be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| And in terms of expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| if we begin to talk about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| one of the things that we wouldn't want to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| expand into the neighborhood and take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| additional properties, but if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| architect could, if you could address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| fact that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| looked at the existing structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| and then also while you're working your way up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| have you developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| actual plans that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| we're going to be able to take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| That's just a schematic site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| So if you'd introduce yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| I'm Mark Rowland. I'm a principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| with Thomas Miller and Partners in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| Brentwood, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| I'm a UT graduate. In fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| Councilman Green was one of my professors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| Remember, I got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| in trouble the last time you said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| I'm sorry. I have to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| the truth up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| We actually began| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| our engagement with Tenova| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| by trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| a way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| reuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| this campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| And you can see on the image that's up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| on your screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| that it kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| looks like someone took some dominoes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| and dropped them on the ground and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| kind of went all different directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| It's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| I've been designing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| well, almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| 30 years now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| I've never seen one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| that's dysfunctional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| The ORs are located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| two floors below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| ground underneath a mechanical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| room, which is underneath a plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| The emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| sits on the side of a hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| and when we looked at ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| to even separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| if you go to the emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| at Physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| you find the ambulances and the cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| what we call the ambulance entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| and the walk-in entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| are a shared drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| And the reason they're a shared drive is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| the hill is so steep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| you literally couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| locate two drives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| on that hill to separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| the entrances. I stood out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| and watched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| a woman and a Lincoln almost back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| the ambulance and so we almost had another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| injury that needed to be treated in the ED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| instead of the one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| they came for initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| It's very challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| The women's pavilion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| is at the south end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| campus. Dr. Brabson's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| comment about going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| to the cafeteria also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| means that the food carts coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| from the kitchen to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| women's pavilion have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| change levels multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| with multiple elevators that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| get all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| from there to here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| and go through back corridors to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| It's a very long process to even get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| food from the kitchen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| to the women's pavilion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| The imaging department is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| one of the oldest parts of the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| so the newest, most high-tech equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| to diagnose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| is located in one of the oldest areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| Very difficult to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| the area. That would have to be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| So we looked at some options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| We looked at how in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| would you begin to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| and renovate this campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| We looked at an option to begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| demolition on the north side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| and to move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| literally move the hospital south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| on the site and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| make the access from Woodland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| It's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| It would require demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| of one of the parking garages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| and so it becomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| initially a huge parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| Throughout the construction process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| things have to be relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| It's very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| The infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| the boilers in the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| date back to 1954.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| They were originally coal boilers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| and they were converted to natural gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| Not very energy efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| I believe your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| energy bills are about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| $3,000,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| $3,500,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| you have the sprawling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| buildings. You have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5027)|

| 1:23:57| From floor one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| you go down to ground level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5039)|

| 1:24:11| Then you go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| from there about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5053)|

| 1:24:17| it's terraced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| on the hillside. It's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| difficult to get from one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5061)|

| 1:24:33| it's a nightmare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| for the staff to get materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| and patients from one end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| hospital to the other. I'll pull my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| professor hat and it's obvious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| that you've looked at the building from top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| to bottom. What about as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| as where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| are you as far as schematic drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| that not only us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| but the neighborhood will be able to see in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| terms of where you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| in the process? For the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| Oak Hill campus, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| Well that one but also the new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| The new one, well we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| the drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5105)|

| 1:25:19| close to having that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| and we're doing the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| study for the Oak Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5123)|

| 1:25:27| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| Another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| question I have if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| Tenova could share with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| I had asked about taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| property taxes that you folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| can you share that with us? Not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| property taxes but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| what you're paying for the property there on Middlebrook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5143)|
| 1:25:51| Yes, this should show you. This is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| Tenova paid. Just the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| Metro Knoxville hospitals. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| three other hospitals in rural counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5157)|

| 1:26:01| Metro hospitals paid over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| a million dollars in city taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| four and a half million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| in county taxes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| 5.1 million in state taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| in 2012 for a total of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| over ten and a half million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| In addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| to that, if you don't mind to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| the next slide Jerry that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| We did a quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| calculation of just community benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| of the health system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| When we look at wages and benefits paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| this is just for 2012 as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| uncompensated care provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| at Physicians Regional alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| it's 58 million dollars of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| uncompensated care. Total of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| 95 almost 96 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| dollars of uncompensated care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| provided. Could you explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| What that means is care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| that we provide that we're not paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| When we hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| the statement you're a for profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| and therefore you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| Really what that means to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| for profit means that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| are required through joint commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| through CMS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| and other health care regulatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| bodies we're required to meet the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| quality standards, the same care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| standards, the same inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| standards as any other hospital in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| town. The only difference is we're the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| ones that have to pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| And our charity care policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| has remained stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| From Mercy it was part of the purchase agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| with health management that our charity care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| policy would stay in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| And then I have one other question Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| the neighborhood has brought up a lot of good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| concerns and questions and I think you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| have addressed those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| and will continue to address those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| just like with the conservation easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| and that sort of thing. But one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| questions I have that they brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| which has to do with the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| and has to do with the agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| leaving it that way until you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| through the process. What problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| is that or will that be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| if the zoning stayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| agricultural and did not go to office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5289)|
| 1:28:19| Great. Just making sure we had the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| information there. We have a medical office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| building as part of our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| So a hospital is allowed but a medical office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| building is not. We must have a medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| office building adjacent to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| Thank you. One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| I don't know who this would be directed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| but I'm curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| because the chart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| the pros and cons chart that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| given us here about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| the four options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| doctors that were polled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| there seems to be some difference of opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| that question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| Absolutely. Dr. Cleaforth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| made the point that he had not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| polled. There's a reason for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| and the reason is that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| physician leadership council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| as Dr. Berline described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| managed that polling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| and they polled physicians who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| actively engaged in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| actively working at the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| I know Dr. Cleaforth has a history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| of working with the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| but we polled physicians who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| working in the facility on an active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| basis today not simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| based on their active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| medical status which is a technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| term of retaining specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| privileges at a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| Give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| what you say technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| So people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| you can be an active member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| of medical staff deemed active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| by fulfilling certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| privileging requirements, credentialing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| through a paperwork process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| But Dr. Berline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| and you may want to talk about this for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| that group, the physician leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| council went out to physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| who they know do surgery in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| facility this year now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| who bring their patients to the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| who admit patients who do their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| work in the facility today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| So that's the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| that was polled. Do you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| to address that? Is it alright if Dr. Berline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| addresses how that was done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| I might be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| to expand on that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| As she was mentioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| the true term of active medical staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| just means you have active privileges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| As I mentioned there's 450 physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| on staff at the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| a large majority of those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| active but that doesn't mean they ever come to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| Dr. Cleaforth I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| I've seen her twice in the last 12 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| I'm there almost everyday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| and I've talked with physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| who are members actively practicing at that hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| when we actually polled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| the physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| we polled the physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| in a committee that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| you are the chairman of your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| you are the leader of your service line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| go back to the physicians who practice at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| hospital, the ones who are actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| going to be the ones making the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| whether they come or not and ask them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| what they think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| but they came back to that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| to the physician leadership council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| with those answers and those were the answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| that have got us to the point we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| Okay that makes sense to me then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| Ms. Robinson we didn't get the answer on the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| I'm sorry I left that part out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| Just quickly back on the physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| portion you do have a stack of letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| that are letters of support from physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| who actively practice in the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| so I just wanted you to know that you have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| Cost of the property $11.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| We have not yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| of course closed on that we have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| option. I did do a quick calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| Jerry if you don't mind to go to the next slide real quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| a quick calculation of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| and this is just an estimate but what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| that property would mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| if developed in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| of estimated annual increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| in tax revenue to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| and this is a pretty conservative estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| based on what is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| sale price of the land today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| the assessed value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| of that as agricultural would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| 25% assessment of the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| estimated tax at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| $2.46| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| per $100 of assessed value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| and then at a very low estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| of the cost of the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| $200 million assessed value at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| 40% for a developed piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| so looking at about a $1.9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| million increase in tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| just to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| And then if I may follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| one more question. There's been a lot of talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| about the fact that both north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| and east won't have a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| what is your commitment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| St. Mary's north? Are you going to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| services there to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| the people from the north other those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| counties coming in and then also how far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| how far is the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| St. Mary's from St. Mary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| central? Right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| North Knoxville Medical Center is 8 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| north and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| is it started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| as an outpatient center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| started as a cancer center in 2004| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| inpatient services were added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| in 2008 and we have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| in a constant process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| of raising the tide of services that are offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| there. It's been kind of an organic growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| we are in the process still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| of growing the services that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| available there. We were approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| for a certificate of need to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| cardiac catheterization services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| to that campus. The cath labs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| under construction and will be finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| probably in January to February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| so we and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| added inpatient dialysis and all sorts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| of services that have just been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| part of growing the hospital so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| yes, North Knoxville Medical Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| is becoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| what a hospital ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| be and is certainly available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| to the folks in North Knoxville and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| we've invested a significant amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| in that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| Seeing no further laps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| No other speakers, we stand adjourned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130829?start=5638)|
