| 0:00:30| This is the chairman's briefing. This is a presentation and information gathering session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=30)|
| 0:00:36| There will be no public input, but I'm sure there are people from the audience here that came to want to hear what's going on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=36)|
| 0:00:43| After the meeting, I'm sure that members of the Engineering Public Works and TDOT will be happy to talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=43)|
| 0:00:51| First up, we want to get Engineering Public Works representative to go over domestic HEN permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=51)|
| 0:01:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dwight Vanderbilt on behalf of Engineering Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| I'll be brief, and then I'll hand the floor to Cody Parker, who has done Yeoman's work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=64)|
| 0:01:10| Briefly, all of you have, I think, both two groups of constituents, and certainly we are hearing this through the mayor's office as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=70)|
| 0:01:18| We have constituents that would like to have chickens typically in a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=78)|
| 0:01:25| I had actually been referring to these as residential chickens, but when Cody was assigned to this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=85)|
| 0:01:30| he told me the correct term is domesticated hens, so we've been adopting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| We have constituents that are waiting to see if it is legal for them to have chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=95)|
| 0:01:41| and what framework or legal requirements might be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=101)|
| 0:01:46| We have constituents who are calling us because their neighbors already have chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| and want to know what guidance that is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| The short answer to that is there is not anything currently on the books to address chickens outside of an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=114)|
| 0:02:02| We thought it was time to move forward with getting something before this body for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| We have assigned Cody Parker, who works in Knox County Code Administration, as the lead on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=128)|
| 0:02:15| I'll let Cody share with you some of his experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| but we have met as a group with Cody and other folks in codes and the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| and thanks to the law director's office for a lot of good guidance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| We have been doing a lot of outreach specifically to those folks that might have an interest in the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=149)|
| 0:02:36| Farm Bureau, UT Agricultural Extension, Animal Control, and the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=156)|
| 0:02:45| We've had a lot of fun with the topic, but we also want to take it very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| There are a number of issues, public health issues, that are associated with chickens in a residential environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=168)|
| 0:02:56| and certainly there are some areas that the agricultural interests want us to be very careful not to infringe on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=176)|
| 0:03:05| and we're very mindful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| Also, what do we do when we have a residence where there are chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| and a property owner has abandoned them and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| and I told the staff, as much fun as it was for me to have a mental image of them chasing chickens around the yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| it's not really a productive use of our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| We reached out to Animal Control, and as it turned out, they have a livestock specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| So this is a work in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| We will hopefully be to you with a first draft of an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| I would like to think June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| That's a little ambitious, but it's going to obviously be two readings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| so we'd like to have a first reading June or July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| And again, just trying to respect all of the interests that are represented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| You've got constituents who want chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| You have constituents who have chickens and want to make sure they're complying with the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| and you have constituents that have other interests in the matter as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| So if I could, I'd like to just introduce Cody to the members that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| He's done good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| Cody Parker has been with us for about two years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| Dwight, can I ask you one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Will you have any public meetings to get feedback from the public before you come to us with an ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| We certainly would be glad to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| We've also been in some conversation with the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| and we might enlist some help from them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| But we hadn't actually contemplated public meetings, but it strikes me as a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| and if it's the will of the commission, we certainly will do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| It is interesting, the guidance that we have received from the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| I need to get that into some sort of white paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| We will actually be coming with a standalone ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| as opposed to trying to do this through the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| Mr. Armstrong can clarify, but if we attempt to do this through the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| there is an intersection with the Right to Farm Act that gets complicated quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| And so the guidance we've been given is to simply bring a standalone ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| that really doesn't address zone but creates a framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| by requiring a certain minimum square footage of coop space per bird,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| a certain minimum square footage of open space per bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| And if you think about it, what that will do is in zones that are more restrictive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| say a planned residential zone where you have higher density and smaller lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| by definition that will reduce the number of birds that a homeowner might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| And then when you get into an agricultural property where you have lots and lots of space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| then obviously that property owner can commensurately have lots and lots more fowl, more birds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=335)|
| 0:05:43| Anyway, it doesn't take me long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| I was raised in a subdivision, so it doesn't take me long to exhaust my knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| about these matters, and I pretty much have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| But I'm real proud of the work that the staff has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| Randy has helped a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Randy Lilly has helped a lot with this, and Cody has helped a lot with it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| And public meetings, we'd certainly at least have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| and then see if we think that there's a need for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| I'm just asking if you think it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| You know, I think let's get the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| One of the things we might also do is draw a little bit from the city's experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| Cody's been working with the city's ordinance to get a feel for their process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| and I think if they did, then we might as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| Mr. Chair, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| Dave, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| You're last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| Mr. Van Vate, I just wanted to expand on that Right to Farm Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| Is that affected by zoning, like you have a right to farm in an ag zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=393)|
| 0:06:41| but not necessarily in a residential zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| Our understanding when we met with Daniel Sanders from Mr. Armstrong's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| was that you don't want to look through it through that lens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| because basically the Right to Farm Act will supersede| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| or trump any local zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| And so we tried to really just take the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| and set it to the side and look at a standalone ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| that created a framework that made sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| and respected in particular density as a means to, I don't want to say control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| but regulate the number of birch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| Because obviously if you're in an area where there are five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| it's inappropriate for somebody to have 100 chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| If you're on a parcel of property that's 40 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| it's an entirely different equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| And so the framework that Cody is working on really contemplates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| in a certain sense, density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| I know you all have done a lot of research on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| When it first got on my radar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| my very first alarm was related to making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| we didn't cross anything related to the Tennessee Right to Farm Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| which, in your words, supersedes everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| and we've got to make sure that we're in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| And to my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| what got my brain wrapped around this was it's almost like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| though we're not regulating zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| we are basically through the ordinance talking about the density of chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| would be a good way to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| It's domesticated hen density based on the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| And that does, in my opinion, pass my own red face test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| So thank you for your work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| I would like to give Cody a few minutes to talk with commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| Again, I grew up in a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| My expertise here is very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| But I would say that we thought it was time to take this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| I have neighbors with chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| I have neighbors with chickens and coops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| and I have neighbors on the other side of high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| that have free-range chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| The mayor's office has a stack of calls from constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| that are interested in knowing if they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| We also have a few complaints regarding those that already do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| So we did feel like it was time to go ahead and address the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| We know it's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| We thought we might as well go ahead and take it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| So, Cody, do you have any thoughts to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=541)|
| 0:09:09| Thank you for your time this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| I think Dwight covered quite a bit of our stuff, and thank you, Dwight, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| It kept me from having to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| It's my first time speaking in front of a governing body, so please be patient with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| You know, you received a handout, just a draft of what some of the requirements may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| for the permit restrictions and specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| Obviously, we wouldn't want to allow roosters in a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=576)|
| 0:09:43| I think that's something that we would want to stay away from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| and we would want to require permits for the hens and the coops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| and actually go out and inspect them before they received the okay to have the chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=590)|
| 0:10:00| That way we don't just say, okay, you've turned in your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| We need to make sure that the coop meets the proper setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| is not right on top of their neighbor, and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| Up to six hens are allowed, I think six, based on our research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| We've looked at other governments to see how their ordinances are written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| and some of them are based off of square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| from X amount of square footage to Z amount of square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| There's two, and then obviously the more square footage you have, you can have up to six chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=635)|
| 0:10:43| And then we've also talked about the permit be active from January 1 running through December 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=643)|
| 0:10:51| That way every year you're getting an inspection to make sure that there's no more than six chickens on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=651)|
| 0:10:58| you're not violating any setback issues, you're keeping it clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=658)|
| 0:11:04| there's not any health issues with the chickens, there's no property damage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=664)|
| 0:11:12| and also make sure they're clean, dry, and odor free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| Those are some of the things that we've talked about as a department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| that may be included in the draft for the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| I would like to say, Dwight mentioned, we did meet with the Sheriff's Office Animal Control Division last Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=687)|
| 0:11:34| and they brought up the number of calls that they've been getting about chickens just running loose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| and I think this is an issue that, you know, as silly as it may seem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| but it's really becoming an issue I think needs to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| Okay. I see four lights on right now, and I want to ask my fellow commissioners if it would be okay to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=709)|
| 0:11:56| We have TDOT here who's come to give a presentation on Hardin Valley and Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=716)|
| 0:12:03| Would it be okay if we went to TDOT and came back to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| because this is something that we can do at any of our meetings, have a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| but it's kind of hard to get TDOT to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| So is that okay with you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| Russell, your light's still on. Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| Can you just hold tight, Cody, and if we can get through this, we'll come back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=745)|
| 0:12:35| Okay. Anyone from TDOT want to come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| I said that, and now nobody's here from TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Sorry. I think Cindy had inquired about me speaking about Hardin Valley's growth right before TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=766)|
| 0:12:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| Good afternoon. I asked Liz to do her presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| It's a very quick overview in terms of the development out in the Hardin Valley area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| and it makes for a nice setup for Nathan's presentation on what TDOT plans to do with Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=790)|
| 0:13:19| So on that note, I'll turn it over to Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| Thank you. I'm Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| I'm a planner with MPC, and I worked on the update for the Northwest County sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| This map that you see before you is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| We have 12 planning sectors that we use to do long-range planning work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| The light blue area that you see on the map is the Northwest County sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| It was last updated in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| This body adopted that sector plan, and it's considered the fastest-growing sector in Knox County for 8 of the last 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=829)|
| 0:13:59| The sector captures a fourth of all county building activity annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| and the little blue highlighted areas that we see on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=845)|
| 0:14:12| are census block group areas that we've identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| to look at where growth and development is happening related to Hardin Valley specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| So this is what our population looks like in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| Over the last 27 years, the annual growth rate for Knox County is estimated to be 1.2 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| while the annual growth rate for Hardin Valley has been about 3.9 percent over the last 27 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=873)|
| 0:14:43| With that population growth comes new housing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| This graph shows residential building activity from 2008 to 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| The yellow on the graph is single-family dwellings or single-dwelling detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| The orange is multi-dwelling or apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| The red is single-dwelling detached, so more like duplexes or townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| And then the gray are mobile home units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| So despite the flux we've seen related to the recession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| Hardin Valley area has continued to average 272 dwelling units annually since 2008 to 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=913)|
| 0:15:25| And now, as of 2017, we're actually surpassing pre-recession levels of residential building activity in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=925)|
| 0:15:36| And to put some geography with where that development is happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| we have a map here, you also have it in your handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| that shows the census tract or census block group areas that we focused in on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| On the green are the multi-family residential dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| The larger the dot means more dwelling units are occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| And then the lighter orange means single-family dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| So you can see these largely around the Pellissippi Parkway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| The Pellissippi Parkway runs through kind of the middle of the map that you see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| There's a blue line following it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| And then Hardin Valley is kind of the horizontal line that is bisecting the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| So you can see clusters of new residential and commercial building activity around Hardin Valley and the Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=979)|
| 0:16:31| And again, with all this commercial growth and industrial growth that's occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| we can see that jobs are going up in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| So as of 2015, when we look at a snapshot of census data for this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| there are over 7,000 jobs located in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| This is up from 4,700 jobs in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| And this is fueled primarily by the growth at the Pellissippi Corporate Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| which you can see adjacent to the Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| and the Vista de Monte area where Local Motors is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1021)|
| 0:17:11| So, Pellissippi State Community College is in this Hardin Valley area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| and they're a significant player in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| They currently have over 60% of the total Pellissippi State Community College enrollment at the Hardin Valley campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1039)|
| 0:17:28| And with Tennessee Promise being passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| we're expected to, and seeing that starting this fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| enrollment is expected to increase on this campus as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| So, with all that growth and development, I'll now turn it over to Nathan Vader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| to talk about the impact that that's having on transportation in the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| Thank you for having me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| My name is Nathan Vader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| I work for TDOT and I'm in the Regional Traffic Office in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| We oversee 24 counties in Upper East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| My office oversees signs and markings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| We also do entrance permits and safety and operational studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| So, again, today we're here talking about Pellissippi Parkway State Route 162.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| I want to talk to you a little bit about some past studies we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| It's important to know what's been done in the past as far as studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| Traffic volumes and projected growth that we've seen in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| Crash patterns and what we call level of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| That's basically a grade if you look at grading the roads as far as capacity goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| We grade them A through F, and we'll talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| There's also something we call a V to C ratio, and that's like volume to capacity ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| If you think about a bottle of water and how much you can fit in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| if it's .8, that means it's 80% full, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| And then some current projects and future projects we have planned for the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| which is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| So when we look at widening the corridor and making long-term improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| we actually did a feasibility study back in 1999| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| and looked at the needs for capacity improvements along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| And in that report, it basically looked at the need for full access control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| from Dutchtown Road all the way to 62| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| and also the need to widen it to three lanes in each direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| Since that time, when the orange route was no longer in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| our commissioner at the time decided we wanted to do a needs assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| to determine what needs along these corridors that would be impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| when the orange route was not built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| In August 2011, we looked at this corridor in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| and there were several options that we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Ultimately, the report basically recommended some TS&M| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1192)|
| 0:20:00| and additional lanes and capacity being added to the route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| with access management as part of the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| And again, that's just a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| When we look at the traffic volumes along the corridor, this is what we saw in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| The top of the page is 50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| That's in the Solway community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| Just south of that, just south of where 62 comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| there's about 45,000 vehicles a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| When you look between Hardin Valley and Lovell Road and the Carmichael area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| you see 60,000 vehicles a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| And put that in comparison, when you're looking at I-75 just south of Emery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| you have roughly those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| That's what you're looking at, about 60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| 67,000 just south of there and 75,000 near Dutchtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| So you're seeing pretty much interstate volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| When you get north of Emery Road, closer to Kentucky, you're in the 25,000, 30,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| So you're at interstate-type volumes through the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| When you try to look and see what trends have happened in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| and what you might project into the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| when you look at the Solway area, over the past ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| we've seen it's a pretty flat growth rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| We're already pretty high, but it's just 0.9% a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| And if you grew that out in 2026, you'd expect to see about 55,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| which is still a tremendous amount of volume for the type of facility we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| South of there, just south of 62, if you grew it out, it's still 0.9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| And you can see the growth trends in this area too for land development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| has not made it to that point yet, but it's moving that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| So these trends could change, but based on the past ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| you could expect to see about 50,000 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| When you look down near Hardin Valley and Lovell Road area, 2.3% right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| and in 2026, you'd expect to see 75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| South of Lovell Road, you're looking at 91,000, and near Dutchtown, over 100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| And there's a little graph you can see in the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| and that's reflective of each of these count stations, which is shown in red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| So this is a map that's got a lot of details on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| We started using GIS crash maps, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| It pinpoints exactly where the crashes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| The green dots are just basically property damage-type crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| Yellow dots are incapacitating crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| And then if you see a red dot, that means there was a fatal crash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| So this is the crash data we saw from State Route 62 to Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| And also on this map, we've got a level of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| which shows a section from 62 to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| Level of service D right now, and the volume-to-capacity ratio is 0.72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| So that's what you've got in that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| When you start looking on down the road, Hardin Valley to Dutchtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| 0.79 is your volume-to-capacity ratio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| so you're almost 80% full on your capacity, and level of service D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| And again, you can see the number of crashes we've had for this segment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| 144 in a three-year period we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| On down the road, Dutchtown to I-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| you're looking at a volume-to-capacity ratio of about 0.98,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| and there's a level of service E as reflective of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| And again, the crashes are 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| And we've got some improvements planned in some of these sections we'll talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| but there's a need definitely for some improvements through these sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| So when we just talk about looking at the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| there's a lot of need for residential housing and different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| So this is just some of the types of things we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| TDOT also do highway entrance permits, and when we look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| we also look at, well, maybe there's surrounding properties that develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| and then they impact the state route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| and then they might have to look at the impacts along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| Well, this is one proposed 13 building units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| Basically, we generate about 2,500 trips a day, and it's near Carmichael Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| Now, currently we've got some traffic volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| We did some counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| And right at 62, there's currently, and this is a.m. and p.m. peaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| 60 and 65 turn in left off of Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| Coming out, the turn right in is 15 and 25 turn on to Carmichael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| And then the people that choose to try to turn left out of Carmichael| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| is 2 and 5 in the a.m. and p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| I always tell you, too, when we collect data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| I always want the observations from my folks that actually do some of these counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| And some of the observations they've done basically said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| when people do choose to make some of these maneuvers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| they see brake lights just light up the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Right now, if you make movements in the a.m. and p.m. peak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| you're basically, you've got, there's not a lot of gaps in traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| People are basically trying to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| if you allow them to make a maneuver that may be unsafe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| many times they'll choose to do so just to save a minute or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| So we have to be careful with what we allow people to do sometimes with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| So it's just something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| The volumes right here are 60,000 currently on the main route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| Another development down the road we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| it was initially, I think it was a higher-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| and now it's a single-family residential with 118 lots just off Coward Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| And you can see the volumes on 162.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| Right now, a lot of it is ride-ins and lefts out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| There's 63 turn right in the a.m., 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| And you're looking at your mainline traffic of 2,000 per hour just in one direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| Southbound 62 lefts in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| There's not as many as 5 and 23 in the a.m. and p.m. peak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| Coward Mill lefts out 57 and 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| So Knox County has been a great partner in trying to address some of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| These are some of the projects the county's got underway to provide some connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| There's a Corns Valley connector, which is going to be a great addition to everybody in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| It'll basically tie from State Route 62, bring that route, which is 131,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| there'll be a connectivity to 131 as well through this connector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| and it'll come out in Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| There's another project currently in the planning phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| It's Cherahala Boulevard Extension and looking at connecting some properties through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| and currently is, again, in the planning phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| And then there's Schaefer Road relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| Current work's underway for that, and it's going to be completed this spring, which we're in spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| So the yellow dots, too, just so you know, those are median openings we have along the route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| So I wanted to point out that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| So some TDOT projects, and one of the main ones we're here to talk about today is resurfacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| Anytime we have any projects, we want to leverage our ability to make improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| and certainly even with resurfacing projects, we try to look at ways we can make our routes safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| and if we can make some improvements to make our roads safer, that's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| So there are some opportunities to make some improvements for safety with a resurfacing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| Currently that project will be let in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| We also have 162 and 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| As you know, if you come in from Carnes area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| there's an inability to make a left, basically come back towards Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| So in the Improve Act, we identified some improvements there for basically a flyover bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| to come back towards Knoxville, and we'll talk a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| But right now it's tentative 2021 turn in for plans, and then construction would be 2021 as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| potentially for letting, and that's early schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| 162 at Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| My office, we are pretty good at identifying problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| and one of the things we've done is identify some ramp queue issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| Hardin Valley, if anybody drives the corridor, you consistently see traffic backed up on the shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| We've made some interim improvements several years ago, and thank goodness we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| but we're still seeing traffic backed up on the shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| That's a lot of traffic coming through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| So we have a plan in place for some additional improvements here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| and it's scheduled for a 2019 letting, also 162 at Dutchtown Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| It's another ramp queue project to eliminate some ramp queuing back onto the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| back on the state routes, and right now it's in the third quarter for this year for possible letting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| so we'll talk about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| When you look at the interim improvements we want to make during the resurfacing project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| we identified some locations along the corridor and want to talk about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| So Centerpoint Boulevard, we wanted to look at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| Currently you have 60,000 average daily traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| You also have interchange nearby with Lovell Road, and then an access point on Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| So we've got traffic counts at each of those access points and wanted to look at that pretty thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| Again, this one, when we went out and counted it, one of the numbers, but we wanted also those observations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| and again we saw any time a lot of people made those maneuvers during those peak times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| basically a lot of brake lights coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| Left's end from 162 traffic coming into Centerpoint, 63 in the a.m. and 24 in the p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| At that same time you have 3,700 vehicles behind you in the a.m. and over 3,000 in the p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1795)|
| 0:30:04| and you're having to cross at that point in time 3,200 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| So that's, just to give you round numbers, the maximum theoretical capacity of an interstate lane is 2,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1809)|
| 0:30:18| So you don't have an interstate here, but you've got great intersections and you're approaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| you've got two lanes each direction, but you've got 3,700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| You've got some tremendous numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| So you have high average daily traffic all day long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| but you're also seeing very high peaks in the a.m. and p.m. peak for your major corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| Centerpoint Boulevard, left's out, 3 in 25, and then the right's out, 21 in 139.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| When you look over where their access is on Lovell Road, 117 left's out in the morning and 9 in the p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1845)|
| 0:30:54| I think that's right, and then left's end is 7 in 132.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| So the access on Lovell Road's probably not being utilized as much as it could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| but we've looked at some options there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| So when we look at the resurfacing project and things we're looking at doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| identified probably based on the past studies is looking at removal of the median along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1873)|
| 0:31:20| It really doesn't make good sense to have that kind of volume along the corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| and allow certain of those left-hand movements when we have an interchange if we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| We're also working with Knox County on making some additional improvements to handle that traffic back on Lovell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| so we're studying that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| We'll look at Carmichael Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| We have left's end, 60 and 65 coming in off of Pellissippi, and then left's out of Carmichael, 2 and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1902)|
| 0:31:50| There's not a lot of traffic coming left out of Carmichael Road right now, but there's a few that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| Some of that traffic may not be going exactly down Carmichael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| They may bypass in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| So we feel like with some additional improvements to Hardin Valley, we could address that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| But the interim improvements we're recommending are median closure here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| Then just down the road, we've got a median opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| This is before you get to Hardin Valley where there's a Schaefer Road connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| It's like a stub connection, and we're proposing removing the median as well there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| Again, we've got 60,000 vehicles a day on Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| On down towards Coward Mill, the volumes drop off after you get to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| So we're looking at here, this volume is 45,000 vehicles a day at Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1962)|
| 0:32:49| Right now, we've got lefts in 5 and 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| Lefts out of Coward Mill is 57 and 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| We're looking at what we call a J-turn or R-cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| Basically, you only allow lefts in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| You wouldn't allow lefts out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| You minimize some conflicts by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| But traffic coming out of Coward Mill would have to turn right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| and then we're proposing putting in a dedicated U-turn facility down that direction for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=1993)|
| 0:33:22| So this is just a close-up of what that would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| Still allowing lefts in, but no longer allow lefts out of Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| Then you would travel basically a quarter mile down the road and make a U-turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| This is the U-turn spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| The good thing about this is in the median, sometimes when you get multiple people in a median,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| they'll block each other's line of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| So this eliminates that altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| So it's a little bit more out of your way, but safety-wise, it's a lot safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| We did the same concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| We're doing it on relocated 66 in Hamlin and Jefferson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| If you go to Charlotte, they're doing a super street concept of a whole corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| It's the same sort of type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| We also did this same concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| We've had great success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Alcoa Highway at Maloney Road, if you knew where that location was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| there was actually a cross street, and we had this in both directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| but it eliminated lefts out but allowed lefts in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| When we look at the Ramp Cue project, State Route 162 at Dutchtown Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| basically, if you know coming from the North Shore area right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| the traffic going towards Oak Ridge drops to one lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| Well, this project would carry the two lanes all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| The traffic from westbound 40 would have its two lanes as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| and then we transition those lanes where two lanes exit to Dutchtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| where one of those lanes is what we call an option lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| so the third lane carries through and then drops before the on-ramp comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| So we're basically widening the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| but also addressing the Ramp Cue needs here at Dutchtown as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| Again, it's third quarter 2018 letting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| If funding is available and everything goes well, it could get let later this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| The Hardin Valley Ramp project, there's a lot going on with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| We've got a lot of issues, but we'll have some blowups of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2124)|
| 0:35:34| One of the reasons we're looking at the closure of the median open near Schaefer Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| is we want to extend the off-ramp for Hardin Valley back to that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2138)|
| 0:35:45| It's to the far right side of your page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| This was a conceptual plan as part of the report that we had to do for the Ramp Cue project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| but basically we're widening out as much as we can to get extra storage in underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| We're adding an on-ramp that goes back towards Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| and we're addressing some of the curb issues with the on-ramps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| to make sure that they're not as sharp as they are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| and lengthening the acceleration lanes and providing that extra storage for traffic exiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2170)|
| 0:36:18| When we talk about 162 and 62, this is sort of the existing layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| You can see if you're coming from the Carnes area, there's no way to go back towards Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| You have to go towards Solway and make a U-turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| I think when it was designed, it probably just didn't have the numbers to justify additional ramp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| but when we looked at it as part of the Improve Act, the first option was just to add a ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| But when we started really looking at it, we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| it's not going to cost us that much more, and we can work with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| and try to provide a connection over to the Solway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| Then if you're coming from the Carnes area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| you don't even have to get on Pellissippi to go back towards Pellissippi State or some of these communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| Also, it opens up if the Solway area wants to make a safe turn at an interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| they drive a little bit out of their way, come down to an interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| and then go right back towards Oak Ridge or don't have to turn left across all that traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| We looked at a couple different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| The first option we didn't even present was a diamond interchange, your traditional diamond interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| and it failed because it didn't have enough storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| It's sort of like what you have at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| It didn't have enough storage underneath. It was too short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| So we said, well, based on the geometry of the layout, a single point, this is called a single point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| If you're familiar with Johnson City, we've got one up there at State of Franklin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| Everybody comes to a single point. It's got one signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| It would function pretty well. We like the way it worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| But when we look at potential for U-turns, the thing, this is called a diverging diamond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| This is what we've got at the 407.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| You cross over the opposite direction, but what it does is you come through one signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| and then you could make a U-turn and enter back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| So if you're coming from Solway area, you could turn right, come down, hit this interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| and then make a loop, come through one signal, and go back the opposite direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| It will work really well, and it functioned pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| So right now we're still in the preliminary stages of evaluating the interchange types that we want to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| but this one might be the final selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2309)|
| 0:38:36| Again, I see I had some dates on there for when we're looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| So long-term improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| We've got the two past studies, 1999 and then the needs assessment in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| Currently, those types of projects, it's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| They have to be planned through the TPO's long-range plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| Currently it's in the 2026 placeholder. It's about $72 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| To move forward, it has to be in the TIP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| It's not an improved back project, and so to be considered for funding it has to be in the TIP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| and we have to be considered with all the other state projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| Planning for the improvements, just interim improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| We identified the locations where we felt like we need to make some changes now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| Centerpoint, Carmichael Road, Schaefer Road connector, and then the Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| If you get further out the road, George Light and some other locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| we can look at those when we're making improvements to the 62 interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| But right now those folks don't really have a good way to make a connection over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| so we didn't move forward with anything right now for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| Then 162 at Dutchtown, again, 2018 letting this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| Hardin Valley will be next year, and then 162 at 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| Right now it's 2021 for the turn-in and 2021 for the letting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| That's the early schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| Then long-range widening improvements need to be included in the TIP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2406)|
| 0:40:13| Just to give you a little background, we've come to the TPO Technical Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| After we presented, there was a motion to approve the interim improvements, and a motion passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| We also spoke to the TPO Executive Committee, and they also made a motion to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| and the motion passed to support the interim improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| We plan to resurface some projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2432)|
| 0:40:40| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Hey, thank you for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Going back to the future projects at 62 and 162, the large projects, you've got the two different maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2445)|
| 0:40:54| One's 12 and 13, the bottom of 12, top of 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2454)|
| 0:41:04| So you're going over into Dogwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| There's a new development right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| So you're going over into Dogwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| What are you grabbing over there, and where does it come out at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| So your bottom left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| So the bottom left where it turns blue, where does that come out at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| Solway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| If you looked at a map, a little bit of a blowout of it, it would connect over to Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| Following the old Dogwood or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| Dogwood goes up around to Solway now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| It is Solway Road, which runs parallel with Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| It goes all the way up to the median opening that these people currently have a U-turn at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2499)|
| 0:41:47| and then goes all the way back down to Hardin Valley Road, Solway does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| But it looks like you're getting into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| There's houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Right now, there's a subdivision going in right here, and they've got a detention pond on this one corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| We've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| Now, that will require some right-of-way, and that was what we were talking about working with the county on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| as a fourth leg, but felt like that would be just a great connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| If we can make that happen, then it connects really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| It opens up that whole community to have safe access to Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| Well, that would allow our school buses to cross the 62 better, and I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| And then when you go back to the dates where you've got two different projects for 62 and 162,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| what's the turn-in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| 2021 is the turn-in of the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| Yes, sir, for the 62 and 162.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| The big project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| The big interchange, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| 2021 right now is what we're looking at for the early schedule for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| And so when you let it, is that when construction starts, or is that taking bids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| If we plan for turn-in, it would be ready for a letting right now, later that year, if we could get the plans ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| What we're looking at doing is a no right-of-way for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| We're trying to build what we can build within the interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| We would work with the county on trying to build that connection road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| But right now, our improved back project wouldn't include enough money to add right-of-way and the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2601)|
| 0:43:29| but we would like to consider, you know, what we could take that same money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| just instead of building a flyover ramp and build an interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| And so is that section of road, it was 16% on the safety plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| Is it still in the safety plan where we have too many accidents for that size of roadway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| I mean, a couple of years ago, it was showing a very high number of accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| Is it still showing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| We were planning some safety improvements for the Solway corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| We started looking at, we had a plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| We started looking at what our impacts were going to be for the residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| the commercial area along the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| and basically decided we could shift some of that money into the planning for this interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| and move this along faster and deliver this, and it will eliminate a lot of the problems in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| So Danny Oliver, he's our project development director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| He's been talking with our headquarters office about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| So we're looking at taking some of the safety dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| and pushing this project forward with the planning part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2676)|
| 0:44:43| My last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Let's go down to Ginn Road, which is in Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| I think it's the next, you probably won't be able to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| I don't know if it's on a map, on a close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| So 162 and 62 come together and you're heading toward Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| The next large intersection would be Ginn Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| Are we doing anything there at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| Because those are the folks that can't turn left in and can't turn right out for about 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| So are we doing anything there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| I didn't bring it to this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| but we have looked at that corridor and looked at options for improvement through there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2712)|
| 0:45:19| Again, frontage roads would be great if we can connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| There's a small section that if we could connect over it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| they would have connectivity to this whole interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| Now, the problem is going to be the north side, getting them access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| because there's a railroad crossing and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| We've been actively just looking at how we can connect folks, make it safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| But we believe that the interchange, it's going to open up some options for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| Thank you. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Mr. Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| How many years have you had these proposals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| How many years have you had them designed and on paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| Which proposals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| Any of them on this thing, for the Pellissippi Corridor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| The resurfacing, it came up this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| What about the design changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| Design changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Yeah, for instance, the design change with Pellissippi and Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| I've heard about that for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| So it's been designed for some time, I imagine, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| It depends on what part you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| We've got these Ramp Cue projects we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| They've been in the hopper for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| When we look at Solway Interchange, we had the need for the flyover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2802)|
| 0:46:49| It's been out there for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| But looking at these types of improvements, when we got it put in the IMPROVE Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| and we started looking at preliminary engineering and design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| these were done last year or the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| So just the interchange with Hardin Valley and Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| obviously the amount of space that's under the bridge is not adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| And this interchange has been not working for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| I mean, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to go by there in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| and see traffic backed up a mile on Pellissippi to know that it's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| Have you guys, what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Why wasn't this done ten years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| Well, I've been with the department, and it'll be 16 years this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| But we saw opportunity to do some interim improvements to get a dual lift off the ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| If we hadn't done that several years ago with maintenance dollars, it would be even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| One of the problems through the interchange is not only accessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| and turning on to the interchange ramps, but it's beyond the interchange as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| You've only got so many lanes you feed into as you head west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| Certainly there's a lot of schools and a large, there's a lot of businesses that provide jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| and we have a very large community college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| So some of those things are outside of TDOT's control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| Well, I understand that you don't have control of the growth, and there is a lot of growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| and it's going to continue to be a lot of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| So I guess what I'm setting up to say is this is the fastest-growing area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| I heard Liz say this is the fastest-growing area in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| And it has been for how long, ten years? At least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| So that's where the focus should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| And the next one we're going to have is Emory Road and Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| That's going to be the next big project that's going to be ten years behind if we don't get on the ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| But the folks down in Hard Valley, when they're letting the schools out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| they can't even travel on Hard Valley Road because the parents are sitting on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| waiting to turn into the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| So it's just an absolute nightmare, and I don't think it's going to get any better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| But I would suggest that TDOT actually put the pedal to the metal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| and try to complete this as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| And Knox County is going to have to work with Hard Valley Road, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| That's Hard Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| Commissioner Brantley, if I could throw in a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| This is one of the few things that's useful about getting old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| But you'll remember TDOT had a plan to fix this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| It was the Beltway, the orange route, and it was going to correct all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| I would suspect that Mr. Vatter was probably in middle school when that was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| But it was going to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| And when the orange route went away, everything simply fell in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| Jim was reminding me that when they went to build Hard Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| Let me say this. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| But let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| I don't see how the orange Beltway would correct the traffic around Hard Valley schools in Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| If that was to take traffic around the interstate and avoid Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| I don't see how that's going to help the parents and the people who live in Hard Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| That wouldn't take their traffic away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| No, sir, but it would certainly help a lot of those movements that you're seeing there at 162 and 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| Jim was reminding me as well that when we initially went to build Hard Valley or improve Hard Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3021)|
| 0:50:28| our original plan was for a four-lane, and Hard Valley residents pushed back and requested three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3028)|
| 0:50:35| And that's the only reason that Hard Valley is not a four- or five-lane alignment today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| was public resistance at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| Well, I hope those people aren't there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| Well, I would say this in all fairness to those folks that were there at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| Not only was there not a middle school and not a major school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| there may not have even been a high school at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| Well, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| But all of these things change a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| My point is when you see these things happening, and I appreciate what TDOT's trying to do, I really do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| but I feel like we're getting the raw end of the deal out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| because it doesn't seem like it could move a lot faster than 2021 or 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| That's my point, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| How much relief do you think that the new configuration at Hard Valley will bring to that intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3085)|
| 0:51:32| There are several things on it that I think are very positive that can help flow quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| No, this is the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| We took the concept plan, and we're stretching it out as much as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| to do with a safety improvement project that could be really considered an operational project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| that you have to fund in your TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| So we're taking safety dollars in doing that, but it's going to have tremendous impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| We're looking at widening outside under the bridge and to the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| Right now on the inside, we've got some pillars that do vertical supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| and we're looking at building just a wall in between those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| widening as much as we can without building new bridges, which is very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| Outside, the foundation walls coming down from the supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416ChairmansBriefingb?start=3139)|
