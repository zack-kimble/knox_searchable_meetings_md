| 0:01:29| All are present. Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| Any opposed? The ayes have it and the minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| Okay, are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=102)|
| 0:01:47| Items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| Items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| Any consent? Well, there's no consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| So we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| Councilman Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| Everybody's kind of looking at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| I'd like to add to the consent agenda items 12J, K, and L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=126)|
| 0:02:13| Okay, those are the 202 fund appropriations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=133)|
| 0:02:19| So first, that is a motion to add them to the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| Is there a second? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| We have a motion and a second to add these items to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| Any opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| So now we have to vote on the appropriations for 12J, K, and L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| Is there a motion? So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| Motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| I would like to ask council if you might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| Since every one of the meetings I've been at, y'all have asked to move the 202 to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| And I'm told by our law director that if you all would like, we can do that routinely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| Is there any objection to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| If anybody wants to take an item off the agenda, you can always choose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| So we will add, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| Do you need a motion to do that? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| A motion is not needed, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| Just do it. I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| He's going to do it. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| Madam Mayor, if I might, I guess for anyone who's watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| if they're interested in what these items are, because it is taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| go to the city website and you can see that agenda and find out the specifics on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| A couple items here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| First of all, you all know I'm sure it's Super Tuesday, Election Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| and the polls will close in less than an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| So if you are watching on TV and haven't voted yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| as much as I hate to ask you to leave the TV in this exciting meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| we do encourage you to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| The polls will close at 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| Let's see. I'm sure we'll all want to get home and see the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| I also want to report we had a really great Mardi Gras parade on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| I was told there were some 700 dogs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| I was the grand marshal, my grandkids and I, and my grand dog, Roscoe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| were at the front of the parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| And as we looked back, it just went on forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| It was amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| And people who came to watch on the sidewalk had their dogs on the sidewalk as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| So I am told that despite the fact that there were some 700 dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| the cleanup wasn't that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| So people must be paying attention to their dogs and cleaning up after them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| So anyway, that was a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| And I think, as Deputy Bill Lyons had talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| that really started from an idea from Madeline Weil when she was here a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| And it's grown into a really exciting, fun event that brought in people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| actually from surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| And people from other counties that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| So it's clearly something that people are enjoying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| So thank you to the Young-Williams Animal Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| and to all the volunteers and to our Office of Special Events who helped put that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| I also want to mention to Council that the Employee Appreciation Luncheon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| is this Thursday at 12 noon at the Civic Coliseum Ballroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| We will be there to honor our employees who are reaching milestones in their career with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| And our retirees will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| And finally, I would like to give you an update on the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| And we're going to pass around a press release we're going to be sending out after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| At the last meeting, the Pension Task Force brought their report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| And I just wanted to tell you what we have been doing since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| The Pension Task Force has reported, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| that the city's current pension system is not sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| They recommended that we consider alternatives to the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| ranging from defined benefit to defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| As I see it, we have two significant issues before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| Number one, we have to determine how to meet our current pension obligations and future years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| within the framework of the existing pension plans for those current vested employees and retirees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| in light of the Blackwell Court decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| This obligation presents major funding challenges that we will face in future years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| Separate from that, but equally important, is we have to structure a new sustainable pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| for new employees that provides competitive benefits and reduces future taxpayer burdens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| We are under real-time constraints on the second issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| because any changes to the pension must be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| must be on the ballot by November of this year, the November election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| Right now it is imperative that we focus on the issue of finding the best plan for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| I've discussed this with Vice Mayor Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| and I've asked my deputies, Bill Lyons and Eddie Maness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| to work with Councilman Finbar Saunders and our actuary, Alan Pennington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| to flesh out alternative pension plan scenarios including defined benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| defined contribution and one or more hybrid approaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| We are committed to getting these alternatives before our employees and retirees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| City Council and the public in a timely manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| such that the plans can be discussed, altered and tweaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| We will ensure that Council members have all the information you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| to consider all alternatives and ultimately place a new plan on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| I anticipate a full, robust discussion that considers all aspects of the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| including the apportionment of risk between the employees and the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| the effect on our competitiveness in hiring and retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| and the impact on the City's future financial stability and demands placed upon our taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| And I look forward to working with all of you on this critically important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| Okay. So now it is time for Council members' reports. Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| Yes, thank you, Mayor. First off, I'd like to apologize for the tardiness of the Council this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| We had a kind of a working dinner with Dr. McIntyre this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| It was just so interesting and a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| In fact, we're going to continue that discussion at a future workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| So we just ran out of time and apologize to you and the public for being a little tardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| I wanted to also announce a workshop that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| And Ms. Mitchell, is it in the small or large assembly room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| It's in the large assembly room. That's the 15th of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| And note the time is 6 instead of 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| Generally, we start at 5, but due to another function that evening, we're going to start at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=537)|
| 0:09:07| And it's on some ordinances that the administration will be bringing forward on blighted properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| if I'm understanding that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| So I'm sure that a lot of folks will be very excited to hear about that and hopefully will attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| And lastly, I'd like to reannounce the TREC, the Traverse Ride and Explore Knoxville team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=561)|
| 0:09:31| In South Knoxville, we had planned our monthly hike, if you will, to know parts of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=571)|
| 0:09:40| But it rained that Sunday, so we're going to reschedule the Fort Dickerson Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| It'll be at 1 o'clock on Sunday and it'll be on the Augusta Street side of the fort, which is really the northern end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=585)|
| 0:09:53| So I invite everybody to come and fellowship with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| and just have a really good time and get to see the new trails that's been created there in Fort Dickerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=599)|
| 0:10:06| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Yes, I want to make mention of the 102nd birthday that was celebrated a few days ago for Ms. Sarah Moore Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=608)|
| 0:10:17| at Sarah Moore Green Elementary School and thank Mrs. Green for all of the very outstanding and great work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=617)|
| 0:10:26| that she's done in this community for many years. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| I just wanted to thank you, Mayor, and Chief Roush and some of your staff that came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| Bob Wetzel and some of your staff that came to the meeting in North Knoxville last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| and to discuss some of the issues about the vagrants and crime and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| And we really do appreciate you coming out and meeting with folks and we hope that we can continue that dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| I think neighbors and businesses working with the city is the best solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| So as a team, we're stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| So I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| It was a great turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| I enjoyed the whole event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| First of all, I want to thank you for the report on the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| I've had a number of constituents call and there's a couple of issues that keep coming up that if we could just get an update on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| Number one is the shingles, both in the east and the west, in terms of what's happening there, Councillor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| And then the other thing, if we could get some type of an update on Lakeshore in terms of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| I'll start with the shingles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| There are actually two issues with the shingles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| And one issue is have we stopped the inflow of shingles to both of these locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| We had heard some reports from sources in the community that perhaps shingles were continuing to flow into the two sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=709)|
| 0:11:57| And so we have had a number of observations of the sites by folks from inspections, by folks from public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=717)|
| 0:12:07| who have been kind enough to go out there on a regular and not to say routine because they go at odd hours to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=727)|
| 0:12:16| But we really can find no evidence at all that any shingles are continuing to come onto the sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| So our hope is that we have stopped the flow of shingles onto the sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| The greater difficulty, of course, is what to do with the shingles that have accumulated there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| The court, in its initial order, suggested that we attempt to resolve that among the parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=753)|
| 0:12:40| if we can reach some agreement as to how the situation involving the shingles could be evaded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=760)|
| 0:12:47| I have invited those who are responsible for causing those shingles to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| who are lessees of those two parcels of property, to provide us with a plan for getting rid of those shingles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=773)|
| 0:13:00| Sadly, we have not had much of a response to that invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| We sent out letters just last week, I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| We sent out letters once again requesting that and suggesting in the absence of receiving that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| we will be going back to the court and asking the court to take further action with regard to the abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| We have also sent letters to the property owners who ultimately, while these are lessees who have created this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=801)|
| 0:13:30| for the property owners, ultimately the property owners are going to be looked to to abate a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| where we have significant violations of our zoning law on their parcels of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| And so we have sent letters to the property owners as well, inviting them to join in the planning for getting rid of these shingles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=820)|
| 0:13:50| And I will address Lakeshore, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| It's really, there are two separate foci for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| One is, of course, what the state is doing is they're proceeding to make a final decision through the budget of the future of the institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=838)|
| 0:14:07| We have every reason to believe that they're going to go and follow through with the recommendation that the Governor has made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| And Commissioner Varney, we have met with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| He's continuing to meet with stakeholders and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| There's a commitment to keep resources in the area and that will be fleshed out as we move forward on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| Also, the other front, of course, is what happens to that property, assuming that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| There are really two issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| All of the grounds, and we anticipate that will be something the state will offer to convey to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| We're just, in fact, we're almost positive that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| But the nature of that conveyance is not totally known yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| It's not totally clear as to whether that will involve any exchange of cash or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=882)|
| 0:14:49| The building is another concern I've heard a lot about and from many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| And that is the administration building is the key concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| It's a historic structure that is really iconic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| The understanding we have is that we will go in and examine what the future use could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| Hopefully with a bias toward keeping the building standing and finding a use for it if it can be made to work out financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=907)|
| 0:15:14| And we can find something that works there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| But that's something, once that final decision is made and the building and the grounds are conveyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| that we'll obviously take a very hard look at and put all that information together and have a public process to discuss that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=920)|
| 0:15:28| and present where we are to council once we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Thank you, Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| As the mayor has already noted, this November is when we might consider ballot initiatives by way of altering our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=939)|
| 0:15:47| One that I intend to offer deals with the at-large elected offices like myself and Mr. Wallace and Mr. Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=947)|
| 0:16:00| We all noted during the campaign last that the mayor, if the mayor received 50 percent plus a vote in the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=960)|
| 0:16:08| could win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| And, of course, we were running in exactly the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| And we could not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| So I would like to offer council an opportunity to discuss that by way of a charter amendment that we might consider putting on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=974)|
| 0:16:22| ballot in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| And, actually, I talked to Deputy Bill Lyons about that this afternoon, and he actually expanded on that just a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=983)|
| 0:16:31| And, Bill, you may want to make a remark about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| It's obviously frustrating to folks to have to run in the exact same constituency a second time after obtaining 50 percent the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| And it makes a lot of – it's always made sense to have the at-large, which is the same constituency the mayor has chosen at-large as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1001)|
| 0:16:49| At the same time, what's complicated that in the past, of course, is the 5th District is chosen along with the at-large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| And there was an occasion a number of years ago prior to this changing where only the 5th District runoff was on the ballot citywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1015)|
| 0:17:02| and the turnout was just incredibly low at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| So I think of all the alternatives discussed then that are on the table, one that makes a lot of sense is to just have the at-large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| and the mayor run together in one election cycle and have all six of the – probably along with the city judge – and then have all six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1032)|
| 0:17:20| councilmen, councilpersons run separately for those seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| And then they can all be in the – run first in the first election being in the District, the second election being citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| So you'd have two separate constituencies, and the logic of the two elections makes sense then, whereas the at-large are running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| for the same folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| So this is something that has been tweaked and tinkered with over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| And the at-large, as you know, used to be chosen by a list of the top vote-getters among the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| So I think that's worth considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| It makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| That – I hope we can get this on the table and have a good, healthy discussion here at council and make a recommendation to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1072)|
| 0:18:00| And I will ask Mr. Frost to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| Vice Mayor Powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Yeah, well, dovetail off that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| I mean, I'm glad you brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| I think also that we, you know, should enter into discussion about changing the schedules of the elections to coincide with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1089)|
| 0:18:20| perhaps, a county and state elections to, number one, save the taxpayers of the city a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| and to increase voter turnout, which has been miserably low over the past three years, a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| So I would hope if we're going to have that discussion that we would include that very subject as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1114)|
| 0:18:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| I probably should save this for when it gets to the table, but I wanted to footnote something Dr. Lyons said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| and that is the biggest concern I have from what you just said about the election cycle would be that in every two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1134)|
| 0:19:02| we would have a spread between three new council people and then a period where there would be six new council people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1142)|
| 0:19:11| So we wouldn't have as much continuity from cycle to cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| And so that's a counterbalance to your suggestion as to ease of dealing with the voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| And we have to think about how that affects the functioning of this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| I wasn't really coming here to talk about this, but since you brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| I think there ought to be, if you're going to talk about elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| I think there was a lot of confusion in our last election on the financial reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| And there were financial reporting periods that were as little as four days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| and there were some as large as a little over 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| It was very confusing, and we need to go back and tweak that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| All of us that ran in this last cycle, we filed a lot of unnecessary reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| So put that on the table that you brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| I believe that is a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| I was just asking the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| I think that is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| It's a code that we can change, but it's part of the discussion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| It's part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| I think we need to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| I think we could offer the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| The ones that just ran, we could probably offer a few suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Yes, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| I was going to call you councilman, but Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| To briefly address Councilman Wallace's comments, the state law is something that everyone must comply with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| but the state legislation specifically allows local governments to implement their own election disclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1235)|
| 0:20:43| or finance disclosure laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| So that's what is going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| The city of Knoxville does more than what the state requires, but we can discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| Yes, I think that's what you discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| Try to get them working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1262)|

| 0:22:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1360)|

| 0:22:43| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| I guess Mr. Hagerman is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| I notice there's a local match to this of $68,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| I guess I'm trying to understand how this fits in the scheme of the Cumberland Avenue Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| This $340,000 contract would be for the engineering services related to both surveying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1379)|
| 0:23:06| and negotiating the acquisition of rights from individual landowners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| My understanding is that there's a little bit of surveying, but it's mostly just negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Do we have an estimate of the cost of getting the land rights, or is that something we won't know until we start negotiating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| That's something that we won't know until we start negotiating, but there's also a parallel process going on for assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| Are you having appraisals or something being done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Appraisals, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| And title search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| It's complicated because the history of the land is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| The state regulations require that we research not only the owners, but all of the renters, lessees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1423)|
| 0:23:52| everybody who has some kind of an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| My last question on this matter is, and I don't mean this in a disparaging way, and please don't take it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| I have a concern that this company, Vaughn & Melton, and I gather we have evaluated them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1442)|
| 0:24:10| and they had the best offer of bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| But what I worry about, does it imply that there's either a potential for a revolving door kind of process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1452)|
| 0:24:19| or that some favoritism could be argued to be shown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| I don't know that that's true, and I don't think it's true, but David Harrell was a city engineer for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| and I have seen their name show up on a number of contract awards, and I'm just concerned that we are sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1469)|
| 0:24:37| through our procurement department or whatever, that we're not giving any favoritism to someone just because of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| knowledge or friendship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| And I realize you're new to this organization, but I just want to raise that as a criticism only in terms of perception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1484)|
| 0:24:55| and I want to be sure that we have good procedures in place so that it doesn't become a reality in some other case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| The whole process goes through a lot of safeguards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1501)|
| 0:25:08| It's bid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| It's the law department oversees it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| Our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| Purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Purchasing department, that's what I'm trying to come up with, is also very involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| It's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| I mean, I think it's as good a process as you can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| And I think it's a tribute to your organization that you produce good enough engineers that when they go out, they're successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| I just want to mention that as a concern that taxpayers could have sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| I've moved forward, but we don't have a second yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1546)|

| 0:27:03| I think the lease of this building really initiates what we hope is an initiative to make Knoxville a really outdoor destination city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1623)|
| 0:27:12| And we've looked at other communities, and they have a starting and ending place for outdoor recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| They have a great website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| They have events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| And that's really what this building was designed for 15 years ago, to really be the starting point to send people out to recreate in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1640)|
| 0:27:28| And so that's what we'd like to do with that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| We have a unique partnership with River Sports Outfitters, who is currently the contractor for the city and the county to provide outdoor recreation in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1651)|
| 0:27:40| So the leasing of boats and bikes already occurs on the waterfront, but not particularly in a great location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| So River Sports has been a provider to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| So we'll partner with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| The downstairs of that building will be the outdoor center, adventure center, boat rental, bike rental, stand-up paddle boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| There's a retail component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| And the retail component is really important because without that, we can't afford to lease the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| River Sports can't afford to do the rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| The rentals are a little bit of a loss for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| We're very fortunate that four national brands will come in and outfit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| They'll invest about $200,000 in fixturing in that building to be able to offer that retail component alongside River Sports or through River Sports Outfitters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1694)|
| 0:28:22| So the downstairs will be a place that you can come, rent bikes, rent boats, get any gear that you might need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| The upstairs we'll take a very small portion of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| And then we're going to use the – there's two spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| There's actually a theater up there and a meeting room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| And we're going to make those available for community meeting space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| The Chota Boat Club, the bike clubs, groups that are needing places to meet, we want them to be able to come in there and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| We have the opportunity to bring a lot of film series and slideshows through Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| Some of those mountain sports clubs come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| And so we have the ability to use that space as really a draw to bring people down there to have a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| And so really that's what the building will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| Allow an opportunity for people to come, to gather, to learn a sport and disperse them out into the region recreationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1743)|
| 0:29:10| which I think the building was designed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| It was just a little bit ahead of its time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| Thank you, Ms. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| I mean, I was very excited to vote in support of this, very excited about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| And I was looking through the contract and it just jumped out at me, the utility provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| which provides that the city pays the first $4,000 every month on utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| And that kind of jumped out at me, just on a commercial lease, paying that the landlord be paying the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1780)|
| 0:29:47| And also when the rent is so low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| Could Mr. Lyons, could you address why this still makes sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| I appreciate that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| And I very much appreciate Carol's describing all the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| the great uses that will occur there and the great asset that's going to be to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| And that sort of is the lead-in to my answer, which is this is not your typical commercial lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| because we're constrained at the city by the parameters put on it by TVA to allow us to make this lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| which require that it be for a not-for-profit and that it be for recreational use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| And that very much constrains the population of potential tenants for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| In fact, when we did the request for proposals, we only got this one because it's such a constrained list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| Actually, this allows us to bring in, put this building to its intended use after it's being mothballed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| And that's what I'd like to segue to, because we're the city has got about a $4,000 a month exposure in utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| just keeping the building mothballed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| We all know a building that's in use is a much healthier building, and it protects our asset a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| We did negotiate with Legacy Parks, and we were most concerned that we not have the exposure to unlimited utility costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1853)|
| 0:31:03| that might happen with another tenant not having to bear the consequences of thermostats being set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| or doors being opened and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| So we're paying the first $4,000, which is about what we're paying now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| and we're getting $12,000 a year in lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| So we're about $12,000 ahead of what the only viable alternative is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| It's not particularly viable, which is a shut-up building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| We don't really have any other alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| We have a choice that we have is to engage in what we think is this terrific possibility that leverages so much for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1885)|
| 0:31:33| under the most favorable lease conditions that we really could expect to enjoy for a building under those constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| And that's why the lease is written this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| And the normal lease of a building for a commercial tenant would never look quite like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1903)|
| 0:31:51| But this is an extraordinary situation, so that's why we've approached it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| I'll be enthusiastically voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| I just want to say how excited I am about this whole project here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| You know, I think we started this process with the last administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| and I can't say how tickled I am to see this early on in your administration that you see this as a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| And I think it is a priority for the city of Knoxville and for this whole region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| And I think Carol described it best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| It's not only about exercise and people being healthy, but it's a good green job creator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1945)|
| 0:32:34| We have, I think, several events coming up this year where we'll be putting heads in beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| So, I mean, it's just a win-win situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| And I know I've probably worn my welcome out talking about the, you know, these hike and bike trails and what have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| that's been so important to my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| But, you know, this is on the other side of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| So it's not just about, you know, that trail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| It's about the whole city and about this whole county and region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| So I just think that this is just a great, great step forward, and I'm just tickled to death that it's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| And, Carol, thank you and your board and everything that you do to advance this cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| Because it's going to be 20 years from now, it's going to be something that we can look back on and really be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=1994)|
| 0:33:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2002)|

| 0:42:20| I think the zoning issues which we're looking at are a very integral part of our doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| The tendency in older communities many times is for the encroachment of industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| We do have many very valued industries in Lonsdale, the great neighbors, and we treasure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| those who are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| However, I feel that at this point it's extremely important that we preserve the nature of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| community as a residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| Thank you, Mr. Redder, and congratulations for the organizations coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| It's a great sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| Okay, I think we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| 12H is an ordinance approving the request of the Metropolitan Planning Commission for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| a one-year plan amendment from live industrial and mixed uses district to low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2588)|

| 0:43:22| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| 12I is an ordinance to rezone property located on the northwest and southeast sides of New| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| York Avenue and Louisiana Avenue, southwest side of Sheridan Street, northeast side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| Stonewall Street from I-2 and I-H-1 to R-A-1 slash H-1, except for parcels 081, P-K-04,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2620)|
| 0:43:51| 06, 07, 10 and 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| Metropolitan Planning Commission applicant, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| I just want to ask Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| I think I understand this, but the reason we're accepting several parcels is they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| an ongoing business use and they are the ones that don't quite fit in this low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| thing, so we're leaving them with their existing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| Is that the objective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| Very well stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| We have no one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| We kind of quickly ran through number 12A, and I was a little concerned to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| that the public understands what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| This is your reorganization to the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| Could you just give a brief summary of what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| I will ask our law director to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| What it is is really an organization of the various departments as the code requires with each new mayoral election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2699)|
| 0:45:10| They organize their departments and their deputy mayors and the directors and the offices of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2710)|
| 0:45:18| that come under the administration in the way that seems most efficient for them to operate the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2718)|
| 0:45:25| And then it becomes necessary to take that organization and put it into the language of an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| and adopt that as the official structure of the government during that period of time until it is changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2731)|
| 0:45:39| And that's really what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| It's more like the housekeeping ordinance that incorporates the new organizational structure of this particular mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2741)|
| 0:45:49| and the way the mayor has set up her organization so that it will operate most efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| So that's what that does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| And if you want to go to the website and take a look at the organizational chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| it would make a great deal more sense to you than trying to read this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| because anybody who tries to read this ordinance is going to be a little confused by it, I would suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| But that's just by the nature of what it actually does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| Well, I think the real thing you said is the citizens can go to the website and see the organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| but it sounded like all of a sudden things were changing and we didn't really have an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| If you just look at that organizational chart, it will all of a sudden make sense to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| hopefully as it did to me, because when the deputy law director prepared this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| it almost made my head swim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| I wonder if Mr. Swanson would agree to attach that as Exhibit A to this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| and that way the file will have a clear understanding of the thing, just put the chart in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| The organizational chart is, frankly, more than this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| and it doesn't really parrot this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| This ordinance sets out the general framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| I'm not sure that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| I think it would be most helpful if people just want to know what the organization looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| and how it's organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Just go to the website, click on that organizational chart, and you'll get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| The organizational chart shows functionally how we operate, who reports to whom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| And, you know, this is more in the legalese of what is required by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| I'd just like to remind everyone that when we say, go to the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| there are a number of citizens who do not have access to computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| and it's not that easy for everybody to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| So I don't think we need to just run by that and say, go to the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| without considering the fact that there are a number of people that really don't have access to computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| I just want to make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| For those who do have access to the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| you can find the organizational chart on the mayor's page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| Just go to the city departments and then mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| and then on her page at the very bottom is a link for that chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| And for those who do not have a computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| if you call the mayor's office at 215-2040,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| we'd be glad to mail you a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| Councilman DelaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| If they want to go to their personal branch library in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| the Burlington branch has a number of computers that are open for public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| I know the main branch does, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| So that's another place where they can even get the learning skills to use a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| It's a great opportunity we have here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| There's nobody signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| so there being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120306?start=2914)|
