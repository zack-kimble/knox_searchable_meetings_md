| 0:00:00| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to recuse myself from number five since that deals with the offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=0)|
| 0:00:15| and I am an employee of the Knox County Trustee, so I will recuse myself of 105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=15)|
| 0:00:19| Mr. Chairman, do you want to take a break for the ladies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=19)|
| 0:00:24| For the ladies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=24)|
| 0:00:26| What about the men?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=26)|
| 0:00:29| Let's not put a minute on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=29)|
| 0:00:36| Let's just take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=36)|
| 0:00:37| Let's take a quick break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=37)|
| 0:00:40| Quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=40)|
| 0:00:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=41)|
| 0:00:42| We can debate them if we want, but I think everybody knows how they're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=42)|
| 0:00:56| This is Tom McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| Hey, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| Let me ask you a question about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| A quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=64)|
| 0:01:08| What you've done, what the committee's done, is to basically strike these new sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=68)|
| 0:01:24| that were approved by referendum in 2006 related to the Property Assessor, Register of Deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=84)|
| 0:01:30| County Clerk, Trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=90)|
| 0:01:36| We put those sections in at that point in time as a result of the Charter Review Committee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| work because of what Chancellor Fanzler had, Chancellor Weaver, I'm sorry, Chancellor Weaver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=101)|
| 0:01:49| had said in his opinion, and that's with regard to the duties and the qualifications of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=109)|
| 0:01:58| Qualifications have probably been taken care of by this ordinance, but what about the duties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| You go back to a previous ordinance where the mayor, or you go back to the beginning of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=123)|
| 0:02:15| I guess, where the mayor sets their, or it may be another one that I read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=135)|
| 0:02:27| where the mayor determines their job responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=147)|
| 0:02:34| Is that what you're looking at doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| We certainly had a purpose in putting those provisions in the Charter in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| and by this ordinance, we're striking those, which also strikes their duties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=163)|
| 0:02:58| and their duties, you know, under the enabling legislation cannot be diminished while they're in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| You can add to their duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| You know where I'm going with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| I think the concept was that in the Jordan opinion, it clearly gave the county the authority to carry out those functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=190)|
| 0:03:24| and the duties of those offices in any way that it wants to in the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| You can't reduce the functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| You can't reduce the duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| They have to be carried out, but you don't have to carry them out through the traditional offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| of an appointed, or rather of an elected trustee, elected county clerk, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| By taking those offices, though, basically out of the Charter, as you're doing through this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=225)|
| 0:03:55| I'm wondering if that doesn't cause a problem down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=235)|
| 0:04:02| Of coming back and letting the mayor specify the duties with the subject to approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| Subject to approval by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| Well, it would certainly be possible to refer back to those old duties that I recall specifically addressing Chancellor Weaver's decision that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=251)|
| 0:04:20| So long as the duties are going to be the same, like for the trustee, as they are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| and you can certainly add to those duties, but the enabling legislation, as you know, says you can't diminish them while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=264)|
| 0:04:32| And I think if you wanted, in an abundance of precaution, to add a provision that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| which duties shall not be diminished from those which existed prior to this amendment, something like that would cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=277)|
| 0:04:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| What about salary suits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| Is that a thing of the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Would be under the Charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| Mr. McAdams, could you explain very briefly what this ordinance is all about to my fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=300)|
| 0:05:14| The Charter and code, well, the Charter is originally adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| had a number of conflicting provisions and did not create the offices, these elective offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=319)|
| 0:05:28| It could have done that, the court held, but it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| It had reference to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| It talked about when some of them would be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| But it didn't create the offices, and it did not specify those duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| What the court held in Jordan was everybody sort of de facto continued in office as a result of it subject to the term limits provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=341)|
| 0:05:50| So they recognized that the Charter can control those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| You must have those functions, but you don't have to have those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| What this amendment does is to take those elected offices, the so-called fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| and to turn those into administrative positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| and the functions would be carried out by people who were appointed through the county government process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=371)|
| 0:06:22| with department directors who were in charge of each of those functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| So it makes it an appointed function rather than an elective function, but the duties would essentially be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| I believe everyone understands what this ordinance is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=394)|
| 0:06:41| I have one more question, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| We've got the effective dates within this ordinance as September the 1st, 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=406)|
| 0:06:54| and that would apply to law director and that would apply to property assessor, register of deeds, county clerk, trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=414)|
| 0:07:02| Those positions, as I read it, are to be appointed as of September the 1st, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=422)|
| 0:07:11| Is that the intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| Mission elaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| Is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| Mr. Owens, you wouldn't be finished because the property assessor in your office would be elected until 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=439)|
| 0:07:26| And that's where I'm getting to with Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| The way I understand this is that what this proposal does, if this passes in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=452)|
| 0:07:41| then the terms that are going to take place beginning on September the 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| and I'll just refer to the property assessor and to the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| those two terms, which would ordinarily be four-year terms, have been condensed to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| That's exactly how I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| How do you go back and you're diminishing someone's term of office that's elected this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| Well, you're not because this takes place prior to the person taking their oath of office, prior to the person taking office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=490)|
| 0:08:17| They don't have a property right or a property interest in the office until they begin the term on September the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=497)|
| 0:08:25| If this is approved, if this measure is approved, the property assessor and the law director would be elected for a two-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=505)|
| 0:08:38| Commissioner Labbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Is this constitutional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| I mean, I thought the state mandated that we had to have like an elected register of deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| How does this jibe with the state constitution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| You would have to go and read the Jordan decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| and the Supreme Court has made it very clear that we can structure Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=536)|
| 0:09:03| and this is one of the ways that we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| You know, as far as bringing these offices in sync with the other offices, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=548)|
| 0:09:16| it used to be that the law director and the property assessor, they were elected at the same time the superintendent of schools was elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=556)|
| 0:09:26| And the legislature took the superintendent of schools election away from the people of the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=566)|
| 0:09:34| and so they left it to basically so what now you have is at this election the law director and the property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| This is your one opportunity, and that's why I wanted confirmation from the attorney for this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=580)|
| 0:09:48| This is the one opportunity to bring these two offices, and that's the property assessor and the county attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| into sync with the rest of the offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| Is it constitutional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| I believe it is in light of Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| I'm really concerned about this, given one man all this power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| You know, we've been talking here that we want transparency and we want to get rid of nepotism and cronyism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| and you know this is going to bring cronyism into these seats when a mayor is elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| Now, to give you an example, Mr. Mayor, I'm going to have to use you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| I hate to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| You've got the two most important positions after the mayor were appointed by him, and both of them worked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| That was John Warner and Mike Arms, and they worked in his election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| Is that not true, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| In my reelection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| When you were first elected and you appointed them to those jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| Mr. Arms did, but Mr. Warner didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Mr. Warner told me a lie then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| Well, you'll have to take that with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| If he did, I'm not saying he didn't, but I didn't have any opposition, so it would be hard to work very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| Oh, but he told me he called you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| He told me that he called you up personally and said he'd never met you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| and said he wanted to work with you in your election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| He had met me, and I'd known him for a number of years before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| You told him yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| I just feel like we're defeating what we're talking about, trying to stop, and we're giving one man too much power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=675)|
| 0:11:27| Commissioner Pinkson, the only thing I'd point out there is just to make sure everybody understands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| it's a check and balance system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| Mayor appoints, commission approves, commission has the right to remove from misconduct with a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| If you'd had that provision, there are department directors, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| that you would have voted for on the removal issue in this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| So it is a check and balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| It gives additional power to the commission and additional power to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| This will obviously be the most controversial of all the issues out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=718)|

| 0:12:05| There's pros and cons on both sides of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| I think you ought to just let the people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| It may give more power to the mayor, and it may give more power to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| but it looks to me like it's taken power away from the people to elect these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=736)|

| 0:14:16| This is Inspector General 106.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| It's an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Who appoints the Inspector General?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| Let me get a motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| Who appoints the Inspector General?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| That provision was described a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| Its request for qualifications is issued by the Executive Branch, the Purchasing Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| The interviews on the qualifications are done by the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| A recommendation is made to Commission, and Commission does the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| Lawrence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Lawrence, I have a question right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| What about a residency clause?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Do you have a one-year, two-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| Are there any residencies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| There is none in the Charter Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| I think that you could make that a part of the request for qualifications process as just a power of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| Normally, we have a one-year in the district for commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| I'm going to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| I'm going to make the substitute motion that we pass this, but make this an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| Here you're talking the Inspector General, the guy that's supposed to be watching over government's shoulder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=922)|
| 0:15:31| yet government is appointing him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| That's kind of like the fox guarding the hen house, if you ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| So I think we need to make this an elected position, and I'm looking for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=937)|
| 0:15:45| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| I have not got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| I feel for a lack of second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| Just to remind everyone, would this be the highest paid official under our current system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=957)|
| 0:16:06| The mayor would still be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| Yeah, just by a few dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| If this is tied to . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| If this is tied to the law director, which is tied to the judges . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| And then the mayor is the highest . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| And then the mayor, I think, makes $1 more, since by charter he has to be the highest paid elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=983)|
| 0:16:31| The mayor could make any number of dollars more, so long as he makes more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| At least $1 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| But we don't know what the . . . Do we know what the . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| It's tied to . . . Is it tied to the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| It's tied to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| And do we know what the law director would make under this scenario of being appointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| Yeah, that did not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| That provision was not changed by any of these . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| So the inspector general is $140,080 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| Whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| Same as the . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Quite a bit more than our countywide elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| Same as the judges of the courts of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| Yes, my name is . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| I see here . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| The commission shall, using the advice of the ethics committee and review of a successful inspector general functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| and other similar committees . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| I guess, Lawrence or someone . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| Could you explain why you would like to have the ethics committee, which is not within their mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| have anything to do with the selection process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| Because it's jointly appointed by the mayor and the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| You understand that's beyond their scope of what they're supposed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| This charter would give them that scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Charter change would give them that scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| And, Mr. Tullock, have you put a pencil to how much this will cost the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| No, Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| It is, in fact, up to the review by commission of similar functions in other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1091)|
| 0:18:19| to determine what the ultimate budget of the office would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| just as it is in the budgeting process that you go through every year with every office of county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| And how many people are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| Again, it's up to what this commission determines would be a reasonable sized office for a county our size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| based on comparable counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| I just basically had a question similar to what you were asking, Chairman, about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| And what is our current budget of Mr. Wall's department right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| And what would be the difference between the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| $156,000, his whole budget for his personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| there in this one position that they're wanting to point will be $144,480.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| At least, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Because that would include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| That's just for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| That's just for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| But Mr. Wall's salary and the two employees that he had, it comes to $156,000 is all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1151)|
| 0:19:20| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| I'm going to give an opinion just on this, Inspector General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| because this is something that we use frequently in the military, really about what the role is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| I think some people here are trying to compare this with the Office of the Internal Audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| My understanding is that the Office of the Internal Audit works for the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| and if there's questions about maybe irregularities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| is that then the commission can ask the Office of the Internal Audit to go and review records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| or to review budgets or review whatever they want to review and then come back to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| The Office of the Inspector General is really a much more powerful office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| where there does not have to be a suspicion of any wrongdoing for him to go into an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| to see if rules, regulations, policies are being enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| From what I've seen over about the past year in this commission, there's questions come up all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| Are the policies on vacation time, sick leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| Did we do the regulations right when we're applying federal monies to grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| They would have the right to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| you're not doing what the federal government says you're supposed to do when you're giving these grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| They would pick up those problems before they existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| If there's questions about how overtime pay is given in the sheriff's office, I don't mean to be picking on anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| The questions don't have to come up because they're in there reviewing these things before it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| The other thing that they do is that they're looking for cost-effective ways to improve the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| and to save taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| If they see that there's too many people in one of the fee offices, they can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| we don't need these kind of people in here, it's not efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| and make the recommendation that they reduce the number of personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| I think that the inspector general, he probably would be one of the most powerful people in county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| because he can go into any office any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| You know, I think he serves a good purpose that he keeps honest people honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| And for that reason, I know it's a concept that we've not used in county government before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| but at least in the military it was one reason that we always kept our records straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| We never knew when the inspector general was going to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| Question, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| The inspector general, then, is proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Right now, we're just waiting for someone to file a question or a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| but with this office they would actually be proactive in going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| They're proactive not only looking for tr-.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| If they find fraud and abuse, he doesn't get involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| He turns it over to the attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| In the military, we would turn it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| In the Army, it was called CID, which is criminal investigation division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| He doesn't have anything more to do with it because there's an issue of criminal problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| if they find fraud and abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| But what he's really trying to do, he's trying to keep honest people honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| It's a proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| There are several roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| It's a very proactive process that they go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| So, first of all, the problems never come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| And if someone knows that someone's going to be looking over their shoulder all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| then a lot of these issues never come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| I believe that our auditor has been proactive, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| A lot of these reports I've read, he's made the statements that these things were done wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| and they should be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| So, I mean, he just hasn't talked about things that we've asked him to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| He's doing these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| Richard, do you care to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| Our office is actually a creation of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| We were created through the Knox County Efficiency Panel, which recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1382)|
| 0:23:09| and placed us under the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| So we would be independent of the operations of Knox County, the executive branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| fee offices, law enforcement, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| And my understanding of an inspector general is it's more of an investigative unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| What you actually described is more what internal audit does, those exact things that you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1408)|
| 0:23:36| An investigative unit actually includes legal department within that unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| So if we're talking, you know, $140,000 plus, you know, just for the inspector general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1422)|
| 0:23:50| plus staff, plus, you know, legal, a department within that office, I mean, we're talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1430)|
| 0:24:00| it's hard to imagine right now what that cost would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| The Baker Center report spoke regarding the inspector general was based on counties that include Miami, Detroit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1443)|
| 0:24:16| And in my opinion, those are not cohort counties comparable to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| And also, one interesting fact that we discovered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| inspector generals do not operate without an internal audit department present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| Miami, for instance, has a legislative auditor, internal audit department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1475)|
| 0:24:42| an internal audit department within the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| So this is something that would be, in my opinion, added in addition to the internal audit department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| if that's what the citizens want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| I think this may have been well intended, but in my opinion, it's a little bit overkill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1495)|
| 0:25:03| And really, I don't know that it's a real wise use of taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| In making decisions, you have to always weigh the risk, the cost, and the rewards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| In my opinion, the related cost in this instance outweighs the possible rewards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1515)|
| 0:25:24| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| That was the question I was getting ready to ask is with an inspector general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| would you continue to have an independent audit department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| or would you just do away with it and just have the inspector general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| But it sounds like you might need to have both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| or at least the discussion of rolling it into one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| This abolishes the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| So this ordinance actually abolishes the office in places simply an inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1556)|
| 0:26:06| But most other places, Richard, that have an inspector general, they also have an internal audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| Richard, is that underneath the inspector general or serves as a separate department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| No, that's totally independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| Richard, I looked at the Baker Center report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| and the cohort community is listed on page 30 and 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| I didn't see Miami there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Well, if you look at the inspector general reference, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| That was a different section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| It wasn't the overall cohort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| When they discuss the inspector general, they don't use the cohort counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| They go to much larger Detroit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| Do any of the cohort counties use an inspector general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| I think there might have been one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| I'm going to try this one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| I'd like to offer the amendment that we make this an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| I believe that this is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| But if we add an inspector general, this is going to be one of the most powerful positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| and one of the most high-paid positions in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| and I believe that a person with that much power and that much pay needs to be chosen by the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1633)|
| 0:27:21| through the elective process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| So I'm going to offer this as an amendment one more time that we accept this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| but make it an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Mr. Lambert, I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| We've been properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Thank you, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| My name is Bradley Mays, 1817 Plum Branch Road, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| And I just personally as a citizen, as you all are aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| I've looked into a few contracts with Knox County and I found money not paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| And I think that we are stepping into a dangerous ground when we do away with the audit department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| Even if we are replacing it with an inspector general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| even if we are replacing it with a department that has outside influence in the appointment process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| from departments that could potentially be audited by that same department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| it causes a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| And I've also looked into this inspector general independently on Google, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| And I have found the same thing that Richard Walls has found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| in that most people who have inspector generals also have an internal audit department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| that operates independently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| I personally would agree with Lumpy that it would need to be an elected office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| But, you know, I'm just a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| That may not be the way things go down, and I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| That's part of democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| But one thing that I do suggest would be included if we were to adopt an inspector general, or if we do not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1722)|
| 0:28:50| and we stick with the internal audit department, which I think we should keep no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| One of the major reasons is our audit department has uncovered so much in the past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| I think most people in this county are going to view this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| if this commission votes to do away with the department that's been uncovering these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| The one guy who's catching them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| Mr. Mayes, excuse me for interrupting, but we're not voting to get rid of the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| We're voting to let the public decide whether to get rid of the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| I keep straying from this point about the argument against the individual ordinance versus letting the public decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1764)|
| 0:29:33| Point well taken, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| And the one thing that I would like to make a suggestion on that this county commission might ought to look into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| is to either give Mr. Walls additional staff or make it part of the duties of an inspector general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1781)|
| 0:29:50| to go through county contracts where Knox County is to receive funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| and to review two to three contracts a week to see if, in fact, those funds turn up in the Knox County detailed finance report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1795)|
| 0:30:02| That's how I count the folks I count, is I looked at their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| It said they were supposed to be paying money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| I didn't find it in the detailed finance report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| And if we had someone working for Knox County who pulled a couple of contracts every week and done this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| then I think that they would more than save the taxpayer their cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| just because the threat of getting caught has just went up a considerable amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1822)|
| 0:30:30| What department this is described as, whether it be inspector general or internal audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| somebody needs to be pulling every contract that Knox County has every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| If there's money owed to the county, if anything at all is being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| It was very easy for folks, hypothetically, in a department to budget zero dollars in expected revenue income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1847)|
| 0:30:55| And when you do that, the Knox County Finance Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| is going to spend years and years and years uncollected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1858)|
| 0:31:06| That type of department or the inspector general's office to where, at least every year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1866)|
| 0:31:14| your contract payments are being made, that we could cure a lot of money that's slipping between the cracks in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1874)|
| 0:31:25| Commissioner Luce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| I think we could get a four-year or possibly an eight-year term that would co-respond with like a three-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1891)|
| 0:31:45| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| Which do you prefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| Just for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| Eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| You're thinking an eight-year term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| This is that kind of position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| I was just curious as to what you were referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| There's two motions on the floor that would establish a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1926)|
| 0:32:15| And would they be related?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| Oh, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| Partisan primaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1944)|
| 0:32:54| What is your salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| I think they're $140,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| $160,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| But they would need to have similar qualifications to a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| That's federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| I'm talking about federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Let me say once again, no matter how many amendments we put on this, no matter how we change it, they don't want to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1986)|
| 0:33:15| They're going to put it as they have it originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| Yeah, but this . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| And heirs will go on also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| But it won't go on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Yeah, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| I'm asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Heirs will go on the ballot also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| And I think heirs . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Are y'all ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| The roll call vote is starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Board of Boarders, do we really know what we voted on with all those amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| Could we read the . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| Mr. Labrador, can you . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| Yeah, it's real simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| We're voting to have an inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| But they're going to be an elected position, not an appointed position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| They're going to serve for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| They're going to be term limited after two terms, two eight-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| That would be 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| Their qualifications and salary will be quite similar to a judge, since their power will be quite similar to a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| And they will be elected in partisan primaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| And we will retain . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| It won't be abolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| The air auditor will not be abolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| We're clear on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| Roll call vote in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2070)|

| 0:34:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2081)|

| 0:34:44| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Commissioner Kampen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2117)|
| 0:35:33| Ten ayes, nine noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| Go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| Passing it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| but we take out the language that abolishes the internal auditor's position in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| Who were the ayes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| Four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| Wright, Smith, Davis, and Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| We're back on the original motion again to pass it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| Commissioner McKenzie, your light is off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| I just had a question for the group as to why they would have wanted to abolish the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| Was there a conflict or was it just budgetary considerations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| Totally budgetary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| Again, that would not keep this commission from establishing an office similar to the Office of Internal Audit right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2209)|
| 0:36:57| We just wanted to make it clear that the Inspector General's office would have duties that were broader than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| and inclusive of the current internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Lawrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| I mean, would your group oppose just changing simply allowing the internal auditor to remain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2230)|
| 0:37:19| I mean, that doesn't seem to be a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| Again, Commissioner Luthold, it's not an issue for me to decide at the podium negotiating with you at 1145 at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2241)|
| 0:37:29| If you want to pass it that way, that's something we could talk about, but I think you just turned that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| Well, I'm just curious because we will have to have a second reading and, you know, maybe as we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| At the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| At the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| And maybe your group by then could come back and say, yeah, that's fine with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| I'm just asking you if you could possibly take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| There was no objection to the Office of Internal Audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| First of all, this takes place in 2010, not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| It doesn't affect anything that's going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| There was no objection to the work that's being done by the Office of Internal Audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| There, secondly, is no objection to the fact that the commission has used the Office of Internal Audit in some respect as adjunct staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2282)|
| 0:38:10| The commission could have its own staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| It could have Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| It could have anybody it wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| We just wanted to make clear that this function was broader than and inclusive of the current functions that are being handled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| in part, by the Office of Internal Audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| Mr. Talke, I don't have a problem with an inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| I'm pretty well in favor of having one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| I'm just also in favor of also having an internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| And I just didn't want to have an ordinance written in our charter that would possibly prohibit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| That is be glad to deal with that at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| That is not a major, major substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| But, again, I can't negotiate with you on behalf of a 75-person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| But I was just asking if you could maybe take that back to your group and see how they feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| I'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| I guess maybe I misinterpreted the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| is what I really would see happening is just rolling the Office of Internal Audit into the inspector general's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| I mean, really have the same people there, it's just a larger office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| because you're going to still have to have auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| Are we ready to vote on the original motion of just passing it as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2361)|

| 0:39:27| Roll call, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2370)|

| 0:41:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| Mr. Law Director, how does this compare to what we just passed as far as our policy, our nepotism policy that we just passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2487)|
| 0:41:40| I mean, is it the same language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| Or is there differences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| What are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| Yeah, it's very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| What it also does is it repeals, I thought, the same matter that we were repealing the same matter twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2508)|
| 0:42:02| Section 8.08C, which is the provision I read a little bit earlier, where you can make the declaration because you're an employee of the county, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2522)|
| 0:42:12| So it does away with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| It does away with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| This is very similar to the nepotism policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| If you want to give me just a half second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| Let me find the ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2543)|
| 0:42:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| The nepotism policy that we have in place right now states that it shall be a violation of this code of ethics for any elected official of Knox County to advocate, recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2559)|
| 0:42:51| directly supervise, manage, or cause the employment, appointment, promotion, transfer, or advancement of his or her relative to an office or position of employment with the Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2571)|
| 0:43:07| It's almost word for word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| And we define the term relative within our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| Does it define it in the provision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| It doesn't do that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| You know, we would refer to our policy, our ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| So the ethics policy would stay in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| This would just simply be charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| It would be a charter provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| And I guess any conflicts between the policy and the charter, the charter would supersede.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| And we would probably need to adjust our policy to match the charter, or should we just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| I don't know that there's any adjustment necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| Well, you said it didn't define what family members were, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| Right, but, I mean, that just would require you to go to the ethics policy, and it defines exactly what relative means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2630)|
| 0:43:59| I was just curious if maybe we should add, if you're going to vote on this, maybe we should just go ahead and add that language in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2639)|
| 0:44:10| Don, do you think that would be a problem if we added that language in so that it's defined and everybody knows exactly what it means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2650)|
| 0:44:21| Commissioner, I think you certainly could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| As you've discussed earlier, you have that prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| I think to the earlier points that have been made about the simplicity and trying to keep the question to a very succinct one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2667)|
| 0:44:35| if you have the opportunity, as your law director has pointed out, to go to the policy from the charter provision and they are not contradictory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2675)|
| 0:44:43| then I'm not sure I see the reason to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| I was just asking maybe if it was trying to make your amendment that much stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2688)|
| 0:44:56| I was just making it all out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| Well, I think you certainly could do that, but I think they work hand in hand in terms of the charter provision and the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| so I think you're probably covered with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| You can put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| You're certainly adding words to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| Each question that's going to be presented to the voters will have to be 300 words or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2716)|
| 0:45:23| so we've got to condense these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| That one would be pretty easy to fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| We have a couple of these that are going to be difficult to state in 300 words or less because they're quite lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2727)|
| 0:45:37| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| That ought to be pretty easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| 108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| 108 is one that we dealt with less than 90 days ago, so we can't bring it up legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2753)|
| 0:46:00| Motion to suspend the rules and bring up 108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2760)|

| 0:46:14| It's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| To suspend the rules, we have to have two-thirds vote, so we need 13 people to say yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2775)|
| 0:46:23| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2783)|

| 0:46:53| I just have a question before I vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| If we bring this up, does this mean that this issue is on second reading, or is this issue still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| No, all we're doing is suspending the rules so we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| We're not taking a vote on this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| Okay, then yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2828)|

| 0:47:14| Commissioner Leuthold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2834)|

| 0:47:27| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| Commissioner DeVries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| Four noes and one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| Recused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| 14 yeses, four noes, and one abstention, or no, recused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2858)|
| 0:48:01| So we will talk about 108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| Mr. Chairman, I'm recusing myself from 108 for the same reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| Tony Norman, Intergovernmental, voted 5-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| 4-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Motion to approve is second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| I have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| I move that we approve, but we add spouses to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| I believe that when two people say, I do, they're no longer individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| They're part of a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| And if money is coming in, if a county paycheck is coming into the household through the husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2921)|
| 0:48:49| or the wife, I don't think it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| I think it's the same conflicts of interest still exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| So I think that, to be fair, that this one needs to include the spouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2935)|
| 0:49:04| And I also think we need to do another one that refers to city employees, because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| do so many things where we're in partnership with the city that I think that we also need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| to put on the ballot so that people can choose whether they believe that's a conflict of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| I move that we add the language that it cover a spouse also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| What about state and federal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| I think that the further away from Knox County you get, the less conflicts that you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2971)|
| 0:49:39| to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| I think you start that there is a, I can see the case that there is a conflict if a man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| or his wife works for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| When you get to cousins and in-laws, I think there's less of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| And I think that when you get to federal and state employees, that it's less prevalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| But every tip we vote on, the city votes on it, then we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=2999)|
| 0:50:07| I think that there are a lot of conflicts of interest with city and county issues when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| we're working on things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| But I think that should be a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| I think the voters should be able to decide, yeah, I think someone who works for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| that there's a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| But no, I don't necessarily think a person that works for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| I think that should be up for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| So all I'm amending now is to amend that this include a spouse also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| And then I'll offer the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| Can I get a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| Mr. McKenzie, do you want to speak to that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| No, not to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| You want to speak to that issue, Mr. Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Does this include all government employees, school teachers, anybody in the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| and everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| And, Paul, I do want to add, this is not aimed at you and it's not aimed at Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| You guys are going to be gone when this comes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| I just think that if the people need to, if they say it's a conflict of interest for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| a Knox County employee to also serve on commission, that I would think that they would think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| the same conflict is there if one's spouse does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| Commissioner Lambert, Commissioner Pinkston can still run in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| Still run in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| The only thing about this, I don't like the spouses being involved in it because you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| denying someone the right to run if their spouse happened to work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| Now, it's like my wife's been here about 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| So that means she either has to quit her job or I don't have the right to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| I don't think spouses should be included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| Do you think that county employees should be barred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| I don't think anybody should be barred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| Well, I mean, I don't think so either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| I plan on voting against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| I plan on voting against this as a voter when I go to the polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| I think the citizens have a right to choose, but I don't think that there's a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| in a person working for Knox County and their spouse working for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| And if the voters decide to choose that, hope they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| I certainly don't intend to when I vote on this as a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| But for right now, I believe we should put this on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| I'm going to vote against it here and at the polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| All in favor of Mr. Commissioner Lambert's motion, say, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3153)|
| 0:52:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| Let's have a roll call vote for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| So just for the record, you think it's okay for a person to have a spouse that works for government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| Commissioner Lambert, we're going to get a vote, and we'll see what we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| Just for the record, I just don't see the point in making dramatic changes to something you're planning on voting against anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3183)|
| 0:53:10| Let's go ahead and end the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| If this passes, I'll vote to put it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3194)|

| 0:54:52| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3292)|

| 0:54:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| I do have a son and a daughter-in-law that teaches school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| but under our current guidelines and bylaws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| I don't believe I have to recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| I'm voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| 11-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| For the new folks, my sister and him have been in the school system 22 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| and a lot longer than I've been on this commission for the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| The vote is three yeses, 11 noes, and five people recused themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| So it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| Are we back on the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3343)|
| 0:55:52| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| I'm going to speak against this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| I think it's narrow, and I think it's unfair that we go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| and we pick out one type of person who has a conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| and say, because of your conflict of interest, you're ineligible to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| Oh, but if you've got another kind of conflict of interest, like a spouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| or if you work for the city or if you work for the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| that we have a lot of grant money that moves through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| it's okay to have that kind of conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| But if you have one type of conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| we're going to make you ineligible to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| You mean the direct kind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| Because that's what it's about, direct kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| You don't think it's a direct conflict if a spouse works for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| You don't think it's a direct conflict if you're voting on a TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| and your boss is the mayor of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| and the TIF is one that the city has sent over to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| I think the conflicts are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| Now, I think we're ethical folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| I don't think anybody's vote is influenced here by a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| I think we vote our conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| But I don't think we should narrow out one kind of person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| with one particular kind of conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| and make them ineligible to serve in government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| simply because we picked on one narrow group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| that there doesn't happen to be any of them sitting on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| Right now, this commission, if you take the people who work for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| and the people who have spouses that work for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| they outnumber the rest of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| So that's not a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| But we don't have any county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| I don't think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| We have one county employee sitting on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| and so we're going to vote to say, oh, he's ineligible to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| he's a second-class citizen and is not allowed to serve in government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| simply because there's only one of them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| I think it's very hypocritical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| I think we need to vote this down because it's unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| It narrowly focuses on one conflict and doesn't address all of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3481)|
| 0:58:08| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| You know, I'm actually in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| I'm like Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| I'm in favor of this in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| But, again, I would send a charge out to the organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| that you are really doing this open process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| that it is an open debate and an open forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| and that hopefully we can make a few minor adjustments to these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3508)|
| 0:58:37| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| Once again, I would encourage you to vote in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| Again, this is giving our citizens the opportunity to vote on the kind of government that they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| I don't agree with all of these either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| But there will be plenty of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| There will be plenty of debate between now and August 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| And so this is an opportunity for us to say to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| we want you to vote on the kind of government that you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| regardless of what our own personal feelings may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| So I would encourage you to vote in favor of this because you're not approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| You're saying, let's let the voters decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| Well, Harmon, let the voters decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| I mean, if Commissioner Lambert or Sam has made a good argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| then it will be persuasive with the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| Let the voters decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Unfortunately, we've made a hash of this where some things are going to be on the ballot by us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| and some things will be by petition in large bulk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| I wish we hadn't come to this position, but that's where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| regardless of what we do on this individual one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| This is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| John, this is another one of these items that's right in direct conflict with state law too, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| We have a state law provision that provides that basically notwithstanding any other law to the contrary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3587)|
| 0:59:56| that any employee may also serve as a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| You do have a law that's in conflict with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| And as I have stated many times, given the Jordan decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| when you're looking at qualifications for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| and basically what you're doing is establishing a qualification for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| just like term limits are a qualification for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| you can place these limitations upon your elected officials through your charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3623)|
| 1:00:33| So says, I believe, the Supreme Court in the Jordan case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| You know, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| Of course, I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| Like I say, that's the reason why I'm asking some of these crazy questions, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| But, you know, when it comes to nominations, we have to go by the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| It overrides the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| I don't understand why some things we've got to go by state law of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| and some we have to go by the charter of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| Well, in this instance, I mean, under the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| you have to go to the enabling legislation, which allows us to establish a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| And as we know, through the Tennessee Supreme Court's interpretation of that enabling legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3671)|
| 1:01:18| we can, the voters of Knox County can, set the qualifications for office of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| that they can term limit this office, which is a qualification for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| and I believe they can also state who they wish to serve on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| which is what this basically does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| It says who may not serve on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| When push comes to shove, whenever this matter, if it is ever ultimately litigated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3702)|
| 1:01:49| it's my belief that the Tennessee Supreme Court would side with the voters of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| in their will to establish the qualifications for its legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3716)|
| 1:02:06| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| I guess we just need to go ahead and do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| Well, let me try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| And one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| Who are the noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| Kingston, Moore, Lampert, myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3753)|
| 1:02:42| Mr. Chairman, they got me down as a recusal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| 109.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| Very fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3771)|
| 1:02:59| How many yeses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| Okay, one recusal, five noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| Thirteen yeses, five noes, and one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3786)|
| 1:03:17| 109.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| This is amending Article 9 of the Knox County Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| to adopt conflicts of interest policies for voting for county officers and employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| Intergovernmental with no recommendation, 6-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| 4-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| Let's get a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| We'll move to the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| Is this the ordinance if, say, you worked in the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3829)|
| 1:03:55| you just wouldn't be allowed to vote on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| Is that how far that Lawrence, the same way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| Or if you're sitting on the commission and your wife or family member is an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3842)|
| 1:04:09| you just couldn't vote on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| Is this a conflict of interest on an administrative matter or a voting matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| Voting matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| On a voting matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3858)|
| 1:04:19| For county officials and employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| But is it on a voting matter or an administrative matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Policies for voting for Knox County officers and employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| Voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| Can I see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| It's 109, Lawrence, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| This deals with legislative votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| Your present practice, I think, is to declare a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| Some practice now has been to start to recuse yourself in the case of a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| This would be a charter provision that would institutionalize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| Lawrence, I don't think you answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| I'm sorry, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| Just for an example, say that I had a wife that works in the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3898)|
| 1:05:05| and I was sitting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| Would this make me recuse myself for voting on the entire budget of Knox County government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| I think that every conflict of interest, and I'll call on Mr. McAdams on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| every conflict of interest would be a reasonable man's standard that if you were directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| pecuniarily benefited by a particular decision, you'd have to recuse yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| Whether or not you could segregate your vote on the rest of the budget from that particular department may be a way to cure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3929)|
| 1:05:38| I've heard some of your group on TV, and that's why I'm asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| I think Lawrence correctly described what the effect of it, and that is it is a reasonable person's standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| If a reasonable person would decide that it was a conflict that would influence your vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| then you have a duty to abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| Well, say you're the reasonable person, and my wife works for the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| and we're getting ready to vote on the entire budget of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| So what would you say I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| You're the reasonable person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| It's 1230.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| You're the reasonable person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| If you're asking my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| That's what I'm asking, your personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| I think it is difficult to say that voting on a whatever the size of the Knox County budget is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| however many hundreds of millions of dollars, where you are not exercising line-item authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3983)|
| 1:06:31| over particular salaries in a particular department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| I will say some of the departments would worry me a little because I think there are budgeted positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| and if your relative's position is a line-item budgeted dollar amount, then that might be a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4001)|
| 1:06:50| If you're voting for a general allocation of salary for a department, then it's a de minimis amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4010)|
| 1:06:57| Well, if you're voting on the entire budget, then a salary would be a line-item within the budget somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Is each employee of Knox County's personal salary a line-item in the budget somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| Only in salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| Which would mean it would be in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| If all of these nine amendments were passed, then it would go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| Salary suits would no longer be effective in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| You would have appointed officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| Except for the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| Except for the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| The sheriff would still have a salary suit because he or she would be an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4048)|
| 1:07:36| That still would raise the question for Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| How about the judicial clerks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| Do they have salary suits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Quests and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| Oh, yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| That's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| That's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| Oh, yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| How about the public defender?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| Attorney General?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| They don't have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| The offices of clerk, the criminal court clerk and the circuit court clerk and all of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4079)|
| 1:08:06| duties, they have salary suits and so does the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| They would remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| You would still have salary suits for those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| I had a question with regard to some of the language in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| It says, in addition, said elected official or employee shall recuse him or herself from the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| and or vote on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| And my question was, why would you want to have them recuse themselves from the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4110)|
| 1:08:37| I would think that that wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| A basic conflicts of interest policy for most non-profits and most governmental entities would say that you would declare the conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4121)|
| 1:08:51| and then you would have no further involvement in that particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| So you could not advocate for it and then refuse to vote or not advocate for it and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| You would just remove yourself completely from the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| and you'd remove yourself completely from the vote under this particular provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| And that's just a basic good government provision in most governmental ethics policies or charter provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4147)|
| 1:09:14| And it's also the typical way to handle conflicts of interest in any kind of non-profit setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4154)|
| 1:09:24| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| You say they would have to exclude themselves from the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| If we're going to vote on something that affects county employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| are you saying that any county employee can come up to that podium and speak on behalf of something we're going to be voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4176)|
| 1:09:44| except somebody who happens to be a member of this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4184)|
| 1:09:52| Would they be able to participate in the discussion as a citizen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| Are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| I'm asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| Let's say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| What this says is you would not participate in the discussion and you would not vote on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=4203)|
