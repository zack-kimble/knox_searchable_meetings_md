| 0:03:59| Well, let's, Judah, thank you, thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| You also gave great interviews on TV, that was really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=242)|
| 0:04:11| So anyway, thank you all, we know a lot of people appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| and notice the great work that's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| Let's see, and speaking of civic events like that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| we have city elections coming up, the district primary election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| we're going to keep saying this over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| the district primary election for five city council seats is just over seven weeks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=269)|
| 0:04:36| Seven weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| That's August 29th, early voting starts on August 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| So the actual election is seven weeks, but early voting starts even sooner than that on August 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| And remember, the top two in each of those districts move on to the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| So I want to remind everyone that we have launched a new initiative and a website this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| at GoVoteKnoxville.com, GoVoteKnoxville.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| to encourage people to get registered and to get engaged in this election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| And there's 30 candidates, so there's really some work to do to get to know them all and to make your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| So we're also organizing a series of events, one in each district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| where people can come, learn more about the election process, register to vote, and meet the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| The first one is coming up in the first district, which is south in Fort Sanders area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| next Monday, July 10th, from 530 to 7 at the South Knoxville Community Center on Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=333)|
| 0:05:42| I'll be there, council members will be there, council candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| as well as representatives from the Election Commission and local neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| We'll have free pizza for as long as it lasts, so get there early, and snacks, and there'll be games for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| And it'll really be a great opportunity to get engaged in the process and in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| and to meet the folks, the candidates who are running in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| There may also be other candidates in other districts who you won't vote for until the general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| but you get to know who is running and hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| The second event will then be one week later on Monday, July 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| That's for the second district, Vice Mayor Grieve's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| That's 530 to 7 at Dean Hill Recreation Center on Dean Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| So you can find the full schedule of the events on the website at GoVoteKnoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| So I hope everyone has a chance to come on out and get to meet the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| So that's the end of my report. Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| Thank you, Mayor. I also want to personally thank Judith for all the work they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| It was a fantastic fourth. It was wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| And even though there was rain, it's still people all around us where we were sitting were real excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| And also I want to bring up, I want to thank Visit Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| and I think also the City for the bike races that we had the Saturday before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| George and I had the opportunity to ride with one of the, I guess, coordinators of the race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| And he had nothing but good things to say about Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| He said the food was great, the people were the friendliest that they've ever been to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| You rode on a bicycle or you rode in the car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| George and I rode in the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| We did several laps, didn't we, George?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| But no, he was so extremely complimentary of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| and that we should all be so proud of the way we greeted all the bike racers and the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| And he said that they were looking forward to the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| So I wanted to pass that on in terms of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| And on a sad note, I would like to note the passing of an incredible woman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| who has done so much for this city, Betsy Bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| And what was interesting about Betsy, and Betsy and I go back a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| In fact, she was my children's Sunday school teacher at church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| And so I've known her for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| And what was interesting about Betsy was that she was not political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| But yet her heart and her hand touched on so many things that we as a city have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=488)|
| 0:08:15| And those included everything from the botanical gardens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| that she was one of the founders of that, contributed greatly to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| She loved gardening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| Preservation and Knoxville heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| She was extremely involved in the preservation of our city and what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| And then also I think that one of the other things that where her heart was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| was for the homeless and for those so less fortunate and so less fortunate than her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| that she shared not only her generosity in terms of finances, but also she was involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=519)|
| 0:08:47| She was a person who not only did she give financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| she gave of herself to all the organizations that she was involved with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| And so I would just like for council to recognize this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| and that hopefully pass on our condolences to her family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| She will be greatly missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| She was a very, very lovely lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| So I just wanted to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| Yeah, just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| I think Councilman Greaves' remarks reminded me that this week we lost a pretty famous UT engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=554)|
| 0:09:23| Bruce Shantz was sort of the father of stormwater control for the whole state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| He's responsible for the sediment rigs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| He's a national figure, was a national figure in terms of dam safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| And really I think not only trained most of the engineers that do hydrology, but had their respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| And he gave freely of his time to give training and courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| And he passed on, I think he was 78 perhaps, but we lost him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| He was someone that perhaps not in the civic organization so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| as someone who really knew his craft and knew how to teach people how to follow and use good practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=597)|
| 0:10:06| So we will miss him, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Anything else, Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=609)|

| 0:13:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| I think that through the course of the time period we've had a number of change orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| that have come before us that we've approved, but this one really popped out to me since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| it's almost half of what the original was, and so I'd like for Jim to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Jim Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| This one was designed in-house and the designer did not foresee the extent to which the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=831)|
| 0:14:03| ADA requirements would affect the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| Having a three-foot wide ADA path across all of the driveways was a lot harder, as it turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=849)|
| 0:14:18| out, than he expected, and so we had to rebuild some driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| We had to get the slope out, adjust slope all the way out into the street in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=862)|
| 0:14:29| compensate for that level section in the middle of the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| It used to be that you could run, and it was ADA compliant just to go with the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=872)|
| 0:14:39| of the driveway, more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| Now we have to have a level section, so it became much more challenging, and there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| several steep driveways that you'd have serious scraping problems if you didn't do a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| of adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Were additional sidewalks added to it when it talked about that there were some sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| that were in disrepair and also the box culvert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| There was some damaged sidewalk outside of the original scope that we went ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| fixed under this contract, and there was a damaged box culvert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| I honestly was never even aware that there was a box culvert there, but there's a five-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| box culvert under the street at one point, and during the process we realized that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| needed to do some repairs while we were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| Without piling on, Jim, one of the things maybe folks don't appreciate is that you bid some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| of these contracts based on estimated quantities, and you have a provision that says if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| need more of this kind of stuff, whether it's the rock or the bituminous material or concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| they get paid for the additional quantities, and there's a lot of that in this change order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| I mean, the scope really changed quite a bit because of the driveway adjustment specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| But if you've got to use more materials, you're getting paid for that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Because it was designed in-house, though, we didn't have to add additional costs on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| the design side, which is an advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=974)|

| 0:17:10| Oh, Councilman Dela Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Yeah, Jim, since your name is on this, I just, there's one feature of this that really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| stands out to me, and that is even though it's a university parking garage, those roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| 1,000 parking spaces are said to be available for public parking nights and weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| Do you want to elaborate on that or just tell us about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| Because that's a lot of parking that will be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| Actually, we'll let Christy Branson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Okay, Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Yeah, so I can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| So we are working with the University of Tennessee to be able to have that ability to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| some public parking after hours and on weekends, similar to some other garages that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| structured in our downtown area, and they are agreeable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| Is that free or is that a pay thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| It'll be paid parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| It will not be free parking, but it is, it's going to be a minimal rate that will be charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| And it'll be convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| It'll be convenient parking and obviously help everything that we have developing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| that particular area with our new investment on Cumberland Avenue especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| That's a great initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| That's a really great partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| And we'll give everyone more details about that partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| We just weren't ready to go through all the details at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| Right, but it kind of leaps off the page if you read the description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| But it'll be a user fee, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| Yes, there will be a user fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| It will not be free parking, but it'll be a minimal user fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| The city doesn't have to contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| No, we do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1111)|

| 0:21:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| 11L is a resolution authorizing the mayor to file a grant application with the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| Department of Agriculture Forestry Division to provide funding for the purchase and installation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| of trees in the Montnock Tooth Seed $27,567 with a city match of $13,783.50 and authorize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1282)|
| 0:21:31| the mayor to execute any documents necessary to accept such a grant in the total amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| of $41,350.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Councilman Dallavovi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Yeah, I see that our urban forester is here and maybe he could visit with us unless he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| wants to drag Chad with him or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| I was just curious because this is really interesting and you've got a number of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| species on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Is this the full extent of a year's planting or is this just one piece of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| Tell us how this fits into the overall program of getting new and better and more diverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| trees in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| Yeah, Casey Krause, urban forester with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| It's a portion of our planning budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| So additionally, there's probably going to be about another 200 to 300 trees that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| be planted with the additional funds from our planning budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| What do you do, 500 a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| How many trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| 500 a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Yeah, 500 to 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| That's from our planning budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| That does not include our other projects we have around the city like Sutry Park and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| street skate projects like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| But as far as the species go, there will be multiple poles of other types of species| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| that we will utilize for other plants, planting spaces around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| So you don't have a concentration of things that if a disease hits, you lose them all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| That's one of the big things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| And that's one of the things I think we've done really well at the city is trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| diversify our tree population as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| Just this morning at Tree Board, that's one of the things that were brought up, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| have less than 2% for, nothing over 2% for any particular species citywide, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1384)|
| 0:23:13| actually very commendable for our city and our ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| Well, there's a lot of news about emerald ash borer and stuff killing trees, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| Yeah, and we would be a lot worse off right now if we didn't have such a diverse forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| There's one other thing I've got to ask you, and we spoke about it in the hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Right down the street here by the garage going to the garage down the block, there are these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| trees with this really narrow, tall column in their style, but they don't interfere with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| the road traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| And you said they were sweet guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| I mean, that's something your department does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| You pick trees that fit in the right spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| Yeah, so we will evaluate the locations, and then we go out to the nurseries and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| pick trees that are available at the three nurseries that we do business with, and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| pick the trees that best represent the location where they're being planted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| But it looks like 10 years from now, you can drive down that road and you still won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| have to dodge the visual impairment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| Yes, it's a fine medium of trying to fit them in, you know, as far as with the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| and everything else, but you also want to try and get as much shade as possible, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| it's a give and take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Well, thank you very much for what you do, what your department does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| Yes, thank you, Casey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| How do you go about deciding where the new trees should be planted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| Yes, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| There are two ways we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Back in 2000, I believe, 12 is when we did a canopy assessment throughout the city, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1473)|
| 0:24:42| through that canopy assessment, we identified down to the neighborhood level, different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| communities and the percent tree cover that they have in those different communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| That information is available on the city website if anyone's interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| But in those areas that's lacking tree cover, we will target those particular neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| for planting projects, which is mainly what we're trying to do with this TAPE grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| And then on top of that, we also have an ongoing tree inventory down to the street level to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| where we look at locations where there are actual available planting sites within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| public right-of-way or within parks to where we have availability to plant those trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| And also, I didn't notice any dogwood trees on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| Are you going to plant any more dogwoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| We had some of them brought up this morning in the tree board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| It's still number one as far as the most popular tree in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| We looked and pulled the numbers from 2014, and it's still a top five tree that we plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| With this grant, there is a restriction where they actually want you to plant large growing shade trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1544)|
| 0:25:53| So there are a couple dogwood trees, but you can't go over a certain percentage of small flowering trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| So we will utilize our remaining funds to plant other flowering trees in other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Thank you. Thanks, Casey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| 11M is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Iams Nature Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| to provide trash and debris removal services for the waterways along the Tennessee River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| for an amount not to exceed $41,400 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Councilman Delazope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Yes, since Chad's here, we'll drag him down, too, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| This is an interesting proposition, and I gather Iams has been very active in this field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| Can you tell us about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| Because the recent heavy rains have let us all know there's things floating in the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| and danger to boaters and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| Just tell us about this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Chad Weth, Public Service Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| The person that, Jake Hudson, who works now for Iams and does this, has been doing it for us for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| basically everywhere from Forks of the River to the end of Scoia Hills Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| which is actually a little bit longer than they've put in their proposal in years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| It used to stop at Buckharn's Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| They want to actually go a little bit further than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| So those areas are what we call a no-trash zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| Now, obviously, when you see a lot of rain, sometimes you'll see things floating down the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| That does happen in a storm, but especially the booms that we have placed along First, Second, Third Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| part of this proposal is to make sure all that doesn't flow into the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| and that it's collected and then disposed of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| So it's water quality as well as obstructions that you're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| Correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| And part of the proposal as well is to try to keep the weir dams from forming on the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| So that obviously keeps water flowing out of the city and other parts of the city into the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| Rather than backing up, you're saying rather than backing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| Correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Up those creeks, First, Second, Third Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| And we don't want to be up the creek, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Thank you, Chad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| Item 7N is a resolution authorizing the mayor to accept a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| from National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, PA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| a subsidiary of AIG, to provide sports accident insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| for the competitive sports programs administered by the Department of Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| for an annual premium of $29,770.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| Do you want to go first before you say it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| Next on the agenda are ordinances on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| Mr. Johnson correctly reminded me before the meeting that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| specifically the charter requires that ordinances be read not less than two weeks apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| at regularly called council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Since we are 12 days away from the next council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1730)|

| 0:30:00| and this is just to create a separate department called fleet services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| It's not necessarily part of purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=1804)|

| 0:35:32| Instead, a lady officer comes by and tells me I'm totally within my rights for 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| How come an hour and 45 minutes later, a bad cop comes by, throws me in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=2139)|

| 0:36:31| What the heck are y'all doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=2191)|

| 0:37:08| You call this the Bible Belt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=2228)|

| 0:37:14| He gave me every herb-bearing seed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=2234)|

| 0:37:19| And it's up to you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| It's up to the chief of police to get into this and investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=2240)|

| 0:37:31| $910.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| That's extortion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| But your chief of police says I can't even file a police report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| I think that's just a bunch of malarkey, and if y'all want to do it, we'll get federal investigators in in the whole nine yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170706?start=2257)|
