| 0:00:38| wisdom to solve the issues before us with courage to treat people with respect and fairness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=38)|

| 0:00:48| the source of our strength. Be our shepherd and guide us through good times and bad times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=48)|

| 0:01:56| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| And in the second, all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| For the Mayor's report, first I want to acknowledge the loss of two people who were very important to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=123)|
| 0:02:12| Last week we had the celebration of life service at Cedar Springs Presbyterian Church for former Mayor and City Councilman Kyle Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=132)|
| 0:02:20| It was a very moving ceremony with many friends sharing memories of Mayor Testerman's dedication to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=140)|
| 0:02:28| his creative problem solving and his sense of humor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| It was also a great reminder of the vision and energy that he brought to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| I want to thank Council for your swift action earlier this year to rename the tennis complex at Tyson Park in honor of Mayor Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=158)|
| 0:02:46| I know it meant a lot to him. He was able to be there and to enjoy the day and it meant a lot to his family as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=166)|
| 0:02:53| We also last week lost Ellen Turner, who I'm sure many of you knew from her decades of work at Love Kitchen with her sister Helen Ash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=173)|
| 0:03:04| Anyone who ever spent time with Ellen knows how warm and giving she was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| how selfless and dedicated she was to providing care and comfort to the most vulnerable people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=189)|
| 0:03:17| She also had a great sense of humor. The two of them together were quite a riot to watch and to be around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=197)|
| 0:03:24| So it's a great tribute to Ellen and Helen that even on the day of Ellen's death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| the Love Kitchen remained open serving those in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| So of course our thoughts and prayers are with Helen Ash and with all the family and friends of both Ellen and Mayor Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=214)|
| 0:03:41| The city will miss both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| So looking ahead, as you know it's noon tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| There will be the State of the City Address at Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| I will be presenting my proposed budget for 2015-16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| and talking about the vision and goals for keeping the momentum going all across Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| And we do have a lot of great things happening in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| And the budget, as you all know, is our fiscal strategy for maintaining and building on all those achievements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| I always say, and I'll say it tomorrow, the budget's a lot of numbers, but more than the finances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| it is our action plans, our goals and our strategies lined out and how we're going to accomplish them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=254)|
| 0:04:21| So we will be meeting on the lawn near the old chapel at Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| and there will be signs directing traffic once you enter the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| So look forward to seeing all of you there and folks in the public as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| And let's see, a big event is coming up this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| It is the Blue and Gray Reunion and Freedom Jubilee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| These are both part of the statewide celebration of the sesquicentennial of the Civil War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| There's been a major sesquicentennial event each year for the past four years in cities across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| And the final one is being held here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| And the big thing over the last four years is that we all learned to pronounce sesquicentennial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| This is a cooperative effort by the East Tennessee Historical Society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| the Tennessee and Knox County Civil War Sesquicentennial Commissions and Visit Knoxville, among many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| It starts Thursday evening with a free concert and lecture at the Bijou Theater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| and continues all weekend with events at historic homes, Civil War sites and all across Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| The celebration here revolves around two main events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| The Blue and Gray Reunion is a tribute to the original Blue and Gray Reunions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| that happened here in Knoxville in 1890 and 1895, which brought together Civil War veterans from both armies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=332)|
| 0:05:41| The Freedom Jubilee will be a series of events commemorating African American participation in the Civil War,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| including events at the Beck Cultural Center, Alex Haley Heritage Square and the Odd Fellows Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=348)|
| 0:05:55| So you can get the full schedule of events at the Historical Society's website, which is easttnhistory.org slash bluegray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=355)|
| 0:06:07| I'll say that again, easttnhistory.org slash bluegray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=367)|
| 0:06:14| And then finally this Saturday, May 2nd, we will have the annual Let's Move event from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Victor Ash Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=374)|
| 0:06:22| As always, there will be games and sports and opportunities for our kids to learn about healthy living and healthy eating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| And that is sponsored by the city, the county and the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| It's always a lot of fun and you can show that you know how to do the Let's Move dance when all the kids start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| I've tried to do it and haven't had time to practice, so I can't promise how it's going to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| So you can get all the information about it online at letsmovenox.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| So that's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| Council Reports, Vice Mayor Palacios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| Two items for discussion for me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| One was this past Saturday at South Knox Elementary School, Comcast had its annual Comcast Cares Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| and chose South Knox Elementary as the recipient of 300 volunteers that came there and worked in the rain in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=429)|
| 0:07:17| But the skies cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| They did a really great job of one of Knoxville's smallest elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| I think they have about 105 students there, so their resources obviously from the families and the kids there are limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=446)|
| 0:07:36| Again, we had 300 volunteers there cleaning the facility, created a butterfly garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| That's the second one for the Osevere group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| They built an outdoor classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| In fact, Neil Schmidt, the President and CEO of Comcast, flew down from Philadelphia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=471)|
| 0:07:58| and at the end of the presentation presented a check for $25,000 from the Comcast Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| which is a huge statement for Comcast and for that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| It's very touching to see the principal there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| It was very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| So what a great event that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| Another great event coming up May 9th is Vestibule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| It needs a little announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| It's always one of the greatest events in South Knoxville, if not the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| You can go to candoromarble.org and learn a lot more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| But I can just tell you from many years of experience that there's a lot of food vendors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| There's music of all different types, and the stage is active all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| It begins about 11 o'clockish, and it ends about 7 o'clockish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| That's a good thing about Vestibule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| There's really no limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| Hopefully the weather will be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| Regardless, we always have a real good time, whether it's rain or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| It is a family-friendly event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| It's very affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| That's a $5 suggested donation to come and enjoy South Knoxville's heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| I would encourage all members of council to be there most of the time, all members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| I know the mayor will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| Just invite people to come over and enjoy South Knoxville and the IMs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| and the urban wilderness and everything that we have to offer in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| That's it for me. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| Thank you. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Yes, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| I want to make an announcement about some CAT route changes as the representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| council representative to CAT, and I passed out a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| I think all of the council members have that before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| And I'm not going to read all of this, but there are some route changes there in Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| also the Beck Cultural Exchange Center, and there will be extended service to Botanical Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=597)|
| 0:10:05| But we also have CAT has voted a resolution to do a free fire zone on Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=605)|
| 0:10:13| that's going to help with all of the work that's going on on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| And I've invited Ms. Melinda Brewer and also Don Disler from CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| if anyone has any questions about what you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| And if you do not have any questions, that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| But if you have questions, we'll try to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| Well, since you mentioned the free fire zone, maybe a little more detail would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| Well, either Melinda or Don Disler could come and give us information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| Yes, I'm Melinda Brill, Knoxville Area Transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| And this is the free fire zone is part of a marketing campaign that CAT is hoping to undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=662)|
| 0:11:09| We want to see the Cumberland Avenue construction as an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| It's a great opportunity for us to attract new riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| There's a lot of worry about congestion and worry about getting through that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| So what we want to do is encourage people to take transit through that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| If you are getting some work done on your laptop or if you're reading a book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| you won't even notice you've gone through a construction zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| And so as part of that, what we want to do is offer a fare-free zone, a fare-free boarding zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| and that's going to run the length of Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| So if you work downtown and you live west, then you can get to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| but we'll give you a free boarding back home all along Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| So it's a way to sort of encourage people to think about transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| because Cumberland is a pretty major east-west thoroughfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| and so we want to help people get through that really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| Free boardings mean you're not digging for change, you're not digging for a path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| so it's going to make us nice and efficient, easy in, easy out all along Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| So we want people to hop on and take this opportunity to try transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Councilman Dalibopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| That really sounds neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| Tell me, Belinda, are they going to leave you like a special express lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| or will you be like in the traffic queue just on the bus and doing your work with your hands free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| Right, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| We are going to follow our regular route for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| We're going to analyze the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| Some of what we might do is detour a few buses around the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| but for the most part we're going to be in there with everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| but hopefully we're going to be taking a lot of those cars off the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| so everybody will benefit and it will flow a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| But you might like to go on Lake Avenue or something else to avoid a bad spot if they were working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| Well, we are working really closely with the folks in the construction crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| We're attending those weekly meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| so we're going to be in the know about what's coming up as far as detours and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| so we're going to be able to adjust and get any sort of information like that out on our social media sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| and on our website so that if we do have to do some things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| And there are a few instances in the plan where there are going to be detours necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| and we're going to be ready for those and working alongside the rest of the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| Sounds like it should help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| I just want to remind people, and Bob, correct me if I'm wrong, I think the parking lot that we're ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| I'm sorry, were you through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| It's at 19th and Clinch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| And it's behind the old tin roof restaurant if folks knew where that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| There's free parking there from 5 o'clock until 6 a.m. daily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| and then the UT Federal Credit Union has been so kind to offer up their parking during this time of construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| So I urge people, it's not as congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| You know, it's not bad there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| I go through there all the time just to make sure that I know that I can say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| and I do, and the weekends even, I mean, they're open for business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| and I want people to please go down and patronize these people during this time of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| If I could ask Councilman Paddles, is that open for business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| It is open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=868)|

| 0:16:07| First of all, thank you very much, Madam Mayor and everyone, for having us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| We're working on 13 consecutive seasons of having the Ice Bears here in Knoxville as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| the professional hockey team of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| This is our fourth championship to go along with four regular season titles as well, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| we just sure appreciate the opportunity and the foundation you've given us over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| to continue to do what we do at the Civic Coliseum and do it successfully as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| So thank you very much for having us and thank you for having our back as the only professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| hockey team in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=995)|

| 0:16:46| It was some pretty special moments that Mikey and the players put together for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| Having 4,800 people in the building and then seeing you on the ice with the guys raising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| the trophy was pretty darn cool too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| But from the local ownership group to our local corporate sponsors and season ticket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| holders and obviously our staff that makes us go, we truly appreciate calling this home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| We have 18 players.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| Most of them are Canadians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| They tend to gravitate here and talk great things about the community and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| that you guys do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| So I want to thank you for having us and it's nice to bring the trophy back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| We're very proud of you all and I have to say it's something Bill and Christy and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| were in the luxury boxes down on the floor with the metal chairs right up against the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| plexiglass and the edge there that's all scratched, but still the team was at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| And you can see, you had to be right down there and watch our goalie, Brian Hentz, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| MVP, I guess for the, I don't know if it's for the whole playoff or for that game, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| just to watch them in action and to have them crash up against you, I really recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| everybody to experience that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| It's quite the experience and they really played great and it was great to watch them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| Like I said, and I've said before, our players are, we're one of the few teams that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| have Knoxville on the crest of our jerseys and all of our players bought into what Mikey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| was selling and the play for the logo on the front of the jersey and not the name on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| back and together as one it brought another championship to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| So we're very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1104)|

| 0:19:31| There is the potential for extensions, two one-year extensions, but they have been generous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| with their time at least meeting with the audit committee and trying to get us informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1178)|

| 0:22:56| Jim, we've all been talking about finally getting the lights in sync and working so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| that we move traffic efficiently and this obviously is I guess what phase one of a several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Maybe you could just tell us a tad about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| I'm Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| Yeah, this is the design phase for design beginnings for what is really a two-phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1395)|
| 0:23:27| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| The design process will design the system for the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| We have enough funding to do the improvements in about half of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| So the signal system is very technical and complicated and it takes a lot of effort to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1418)|
| 0:23:48| design a system that really works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| John Benditz from Kimley-Horne, the consultant, is in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| If you ask me any questions that really stump me, I'll send them on to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| I'm assuming instead of, it's not random, but it seems like things are always out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| sync sometimes when you're driving around these days that we're going to have a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| more control in trying to get cars to keep moving instead of stop and go traffic and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| air pollution and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Well, we do make a lot of effort to keep things reasonably well in sync, but the equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| is very old and unreliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| It goes out of sync on its own, partly because it's just old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| Part of this process is, part of the whole first phase is to replace some of that old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1468)|
| 0:24:35| equipment, make it work better together, but also take it to the next level of sophistication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| with communication in the corridors to keep things synchronized once we get them set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| and to some extent adapt to traffic at different times of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| And one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| This is about $1.3 million, but the overall project is obviously bigger because you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| got construction and additional design work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| What's the ballpark figure you're shooting at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| The funding we have right now, the total budget is $7 million, so this is the design end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| the first $7 million, but it also does most of the design work for the second roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| That should be the whole project there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1525)|

| 0:26:10| Former Councilwoman Carlene Malone and Lynn Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Mr. Redman asked that I speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| Mayor O'Hara, members of City Council, Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| I'm here tonight on behalf of the community forum and organization of city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| The members of the community forum ask that you approve the resolution opting back into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| the state law that mandates annual training for MPC Commission members as well as BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| members and certain other staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| We appreciate the leadership of Mayor O'Hara and the work of her staff on this issue and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| also the work of Councilman and Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| This may sound like a simple issue and a no-brainer, but it's a very important one to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1616)|
| 0:27:04| In our opinion, to the detriment of the community, in 2002 and 2003, the county and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| respectively opted out of the state requirement for training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| Other major cities in the state of Tennessee did not opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Their planning commissioners and BZA members had the benefit of formal independent training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1638)|
| 0:27:25| and the community had the benefit of commissioners and BZA members who were more knowledgeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1645)|
| 0:27:33| We're delighted to report that last evening the county commission voted unanimously to opt back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| into the state law and we are thankful for their vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| The cost of outside training is minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| The benefit to the community is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| And it's our understanding that the intent is for outside training from a group such as MTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| who we believe are very proficient and the pros in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| The more knowledgeable we are, both as decision makers, as members of boards and commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| as well as citizens at large, the better off we will all be in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| We think knowledge is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| And we ask that you approve this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| And as the resolution states, it is in the public interest that this resolution be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| Thank you so much for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Thank you, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| Mr. Redman, thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| Mayor O'Hara, members of City Council, I'm Len Redman, 5246 Oak Hill Lane in the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1714)|
| 0:28:42| Really, I'm just up here to echo what Ms. Malone said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| but also to thank our city mayor and her staff for putting this together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| and to thank the county mayor, too, because both mayors worked together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| The resolution you see before you, there's a companion resolution that was passed last night by a county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| and a rare unanimous vote for those guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| I'd just like to urge you guys to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| Thank you very much for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Thank you, and I appreciate Community Forum bringing the issue to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| Tell them thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| 11-aye is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Playwright LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| for the renovation of two tennis courts at West Hills Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| converting them into six pickleball courts and for the construction of an ADA-compliant asphalt path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1770)|
| 0:29:37| from the parking lot for an amount not to exceed $48,750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| I'm tempted to ask, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| I'm a dinosaur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| YouTube it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| I did that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| YouTube it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Pickleball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Who wants to explain it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Joe, where's Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Come on, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| I've had so many people thank me for you all starting pickleball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| so why don't you explain it to everybody and then they can go home and YouTube it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| Joe Walls, city and also partial recreation department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| Pickleball, it's a fairly new sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| It's a lot like tennis except you play it on a much smaller court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| It's more geared toward people over my age and older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1817)|
| 0:30:26| But it's very popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| We established it indoor at some of our recreation centers just about a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| and it's really exploded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| We got lots and lots of people wanting to play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| so we decided to convert some of our couple outdoor courts that haven't been used in quite a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| and we're going to convert those, like the ordinance says, from two to six courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| So we expect a lot of the regulars to come outside and start playing pickleball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| So some of us who are slower moving can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| It's a whiffle ball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| It's not like a tennis ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| It's a little harder than a tennis ball, but it's solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| The paddle is more like a racquetball paddle than it is a tennis court paddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| So you'll just have to come out and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| Once we get the course resurfaced, we'll have a ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| We'll bring some extra paddles, and we'll do some demonstrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| and invite council to come out there and pick up this new sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| Yeah, we'll stick sides and try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| I want to say that if any of you have been out in this particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| these tennis courts have sat vacant for I'm not sure how many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| Too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Too long, and also the city put in a gravel parking lot here last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| which has helped with the baseball and other sports facilities, and this will be right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| And since this is in the second district and we're going to have the pickleball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| I want to challenge the mayor to the first game at ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| I accept that challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| We'll get you some lessons before we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| Do I get a lesson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| Anyway, mayor, you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| You apparently know how to do this already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| I didn't know what pickleball is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Challenge accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| 11J is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| Knoxville's Community Development Corporation for the city to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1934)|

| 0:32:22| recreation facilities and recreation programming for public housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| 11K is a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| Knoxville to negotiate and accept from the Cortland Group LLC payments in lieu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| of ad valorem taxes with respect to property located at 317 Ogden Street and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| finding that such payments are deemed to be in furtherance of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1965)|

| 0:32:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Councilman Dallavanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| I see Jeffrey Nash there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| Maybe he would take a minute and just tell us about his project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| You're almost like the first step marching down Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| Tell us what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| Good evening, City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| Jeffrey Nash, 129 South Central Street, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| We have, as you're probably already aware, we're about 65 percent through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| development that we're doing on the junction of Magnolia and Central, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| proving to be very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| We've had great response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| We've already sold the commercial space there to what we consider to be a great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2013)|
| 0:33:40| great buyer to the Hedstrom Design Company, a firm of landscape architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| Because this started so well and because we were very much the first people to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| anything of any great nature in this particular area, we saw a blighted site on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| the corner of Ogden and Magnolia, which literally is a blighted site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| It had junk in the yard there and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| So we have taken the plunge at this early stage and decided that it happens to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| an area where we'd like to do phase two of the development that we're currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| And that's exactly what this application is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| Could you help those of us who are not familiar with British terms, what is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| mew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Can you paint a picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| What's a mew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Is it an alley, a building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| London is full of mews, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| Every single building that was built as a residence building in London had a rear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| entrance, which was for the staff and for the horses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| And all of those rear entrances were called mews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| You here call them alleys, but we don't like to call them alleys because alleys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| seem to be where you put trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| And what we had in London always was a rear exit, a rear entrance for cooking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| staff, housekeepers, and that's where the horse keepers actually stayed and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| horses had their stables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| So you might ride in there and turn your horse over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| So it's called the mews development because very kindly the city closed a right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| of way, which as far as I was concerned you called an alley, to me was a mews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| It was at the rear of the building and we've created within the development that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| we have at the moment another alleyway, which we're also obviously calling a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| mews, so the whole site is named the mews development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| Well, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| That's a nice little piece of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you, Mr. Nash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| I'm sorry I didn't get a hold of you before the meeting, but two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| Do you own the billboard that's on the drive and tell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| That is in the rear part of Marie's Tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| And what's going to happen to Marie Tavern's sign that's on the corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| No, that is no longer on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| So what's on the drawing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| It's gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| It's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| If by any chance you get a hold of the property where the billboard is, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| like for you to consider removing it, doing away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| Well, I would love to do that, Mr. Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| But unfortunately, Lamar has signed a very long-term agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| They bought that right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| We have had several discussions with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| And I feel it's very unlikely that we will ever get that billboard removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Item 311L is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2226)|

| 0:37:21| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2241)|

| 0:37:23| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| We have one person signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| Mayor O'Hara, Mr. Venney, Anastasio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| Anastasio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| I'm sorry, Venney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Anastasio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Finally got it right, Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Anastasio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Now it's Anastasio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Set my timer and state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Venney Anastasio, 21 Locust Street, Apartment 1011, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| Okay, Mayor O'Hara, you were asking on feedback on the old courthouse, the Knoxville Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| and a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| Has the City Council considered how much revenue it would lose by tearing down the Coliseum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| I say we model it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| It would be a great investment and would save taxpayers money, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| I feel that by buying the old courthouse would be a great investment, too, because a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| of people in Knoxville use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| The McCullough Warehouse, to me, was a bad investment due to the price tag and what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| City paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| On the Magnolia Avenue, it depends on what the City plans to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| Number five, whatever the City Council decides from this feedback, I hope it is the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2323)|
| 0:38:51| decision and it benefits the City in the long run and the taxpayers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| Mayor O'Hara, I'm definitely voting for you, and you're going to win by a landslide because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| of the fact of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| The guy is unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| I definitely am not going to vote for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| I'm definitely going to vote for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Thank you for your service, Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| My personal feeling is I'm going to miss you when you turn this up as Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| I really am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| From the bottom of my heart, thank you for everything you've done for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| Thank you, Vinnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| We appreciate how well-informed you stay, and I certainly invite you to come back often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| Mayor O'Hara, if I could, I would, but sometimes some of the topics that you have, I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Don't interest you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| No, it don't interest me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| Yeah, and Mayor O'Hara, they did a great article on you on New Sentinel Sunday, and the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| from New Sentinel really went for the jug of the pain, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150428?start=2388)|
