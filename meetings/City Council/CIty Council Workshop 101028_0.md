| 0:03:55| I want to ask Mr. Brown to open up with a brief word of prayer and we'll ask Ms. Palmer to lead us in the pledge after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=235)|
| 0:04:08| If you'd all please rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| Let's bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this, another beautiful day that you have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| We ask the blessing for each and every person assembled here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| We ask that thou would be with this city as we seek to do the work of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| These and other blessings we ask in thy son's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| one nation, under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| All right, Ms. Wilson, can you call the council roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=293)|

| 0:05:07| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| All right, we have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| I'm going to go ahead and introduce several MPC commissioners who are sitting with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| and I think I'm going to get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| We have Laura Cole, Bart Carey, and George Ewart on this side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| and over here we have Wes Starrer, Rebecca Longmire, and Nate Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| Thank you all for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| We appreciate this, and hopefully this can be a better education for all of us together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| You all might know to ask some questions that we would miss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| Before we get started, traditionally public forum is not part of a city council agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=346)|
| 0:05:54| We usually add that, but I'm going to go ahead and say if there's no objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| I'm going to rule that we're adding public forum, and I see no objection, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| There is a sign-up sheet over here on the end of this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| If you're interested in speaking, please sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| We'll do that at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| Does anybody have any announcements or opening statements they want to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| If not, I'm going to be off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Folks on this side, if I don't see your light, the main microphone isn't working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| I think the McWhirter campaign has gotten here and done something, so that was a joke, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=386)|
| 0:06:36| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Nick DeLaVoppe is not here, so somebody has to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| I wanted to start, before I turn this over to Mr. Norman and Mr. Holquist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| I wanted to just say a word about what these plans mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| and I'm going to ask Mr. Donaldson or Mr. Swanson to correct me if I missed something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| Sometimes with plans like this, we sort of over or underestimate what they mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| Sometimes we say, oh, my God, look at everything that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| We've got a, you know, it's real exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| On the other hand, sometimes we say it's just a plan, it doesn't mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| The truth is this plan, as I understand it, doesn't change any of the zones for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| doesn't change any of the sector plans for the city, and I don't think it does that for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| but hang on a second, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| What it does is it charts us a path that we want to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| A lot of what's in here will come to us in different ways down the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| but we should talk about those things that we don't necessarily feel comfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| so we know what to move forward or things we're excited about here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| And I think that's it, and I know Mr. Donaldson is wanting to clarify what I just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| so please, as I said in my e-mail to folks, this is confusing even to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| So, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| With adoption, this plan would provide staff a new boundary for what we call slope protection areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=472)|
| 0:08:00| that are identified in our land use plan, which is a part of the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| which is commonly known as sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| But it is advisory in its nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| Staff uses that area when reviewing zoning applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| and making our recommendations to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| who then make a recommendation to the legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| In that sense, things will change a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| Good, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| If not, let me turn it over to Tony Norman, Mr. Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| and Mr. Ex-Councilman Mr. Holquist, who are chairs of this task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| and I think have done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| So, Mr. Norman, you're at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| And thank you, City Council, for being willing to come and listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| and ask questions and work with us on something that we think is extremely important to the community, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=537)|
| 0:09:09| And so we just greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| One second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| Mr. Donaldson has copies of the actual report if folks need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| They're available down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| I don't know we have enough copies for everybody here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| but if people want to look at that, it's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| My role here is sort of a set-up guy to do the introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| When I do the introduction, Liz and I did a little talk the other day at the Sertoma Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| and at the end of my introduction there, I said, Liz, how did I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| Did I go a little too long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| She said, a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| And so I've got to be careful, but when the topic of forests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=585)|
| 0:09:53| and especially forested hillsides, which are closely interwoven with the topic of water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=593)|
| 0:10:00| water quality, streams, et cetera, this is stuff that's built into my DNA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=600)|
| 0:10:10| And so it takes me way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| Way back beyond the issue of the South Knoxville Water Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| which I consider was just a flashpoint that when Joe got embroiled in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=618)|
| 0:10:27| and the South Knoxville folks were sort of the ones most closely involved, I guess, at first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=627)|
| 0:10:38| the issue was not that water tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| The issue was, for those of us that have lived in Knoxville and Knox County their whole lives like I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| is a long-standing issue of there's something wrong with the way we develop steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=649)|
| 0:10:56| There's something wrong with having borrow pits in place of our steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=656)|
| 0:11:04| And so historically, I could go back into the 70s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| and cite examples of these borrow pits that were just egregious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=669)|
| 0:11:19| They're just galling examples of what we should not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=679)|
| 0:11:27| And by and large, that's an opinion of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| and as you'll see, it's an opinion of a whole lot of people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| So that's kind of this goes way back for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| But, of course, to take us forward into the contemporary time three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=705)|
| 0:11:54| after the water tower issue hit, I called Joe and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=714)|
| 0:12:01| Joe, is there a possibility that we can use this to address this issue of improper development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=721)|
| 0:12:12| And he came up with the idea that, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| we might be able to do something between the city council and the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| and address this issue that we thought was a long-standing deep issue that we needed to tackle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=741)|
| 0:12:35| And so, of course, the task force was formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| You know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| And the city council asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| They approved it and said, yes, go work and bring us recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| So did the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| So people on both of those bodies, our representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| you all on both of those bodies said, yes, we think we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| Go see what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| And so three years later, approximately, two and a half years later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| after a heck of a lot of work, and Joe's going to go over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| You're going to see the slide presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| You're going to see those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| We're going to talk about those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| We're going to talk about the difficult spots in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| And they do pose some difficulty for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| But I think at the end of the day, I hate to use that term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| but at the end of the day when we're done with this, we're going to be able to work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| And this community is going to be much better for what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| Okay, now we're going to have kind of the teacher mode here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| Liz has provided you with a list of the task force members and sort of a little short bio on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| You've got some notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| You're going to take notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| We're going to give you a test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Are we going to count it, Liz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| We're going to count it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| So we hope that during this process, I think what we hope you – we don't want to be too Nazism here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=848)|
| 0:14:18| We're trying to get through the slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| If you just have to ask a question right then, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| But we are trying to get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| We could spend a whole lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| You'll see some slides that are kind of tech – they're pretty techie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| and it might take several minutes to deal with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| So we're going to take all the questions that you want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| So hopefully just sort of bear with us and let us get through the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| Are we ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Come on, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=887)|
| 0:14:55| Thank you, Commissioner Norman, and thank you, council, for inviting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| It's great to be back with you folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| Some of you folks weren't here when I was here, but I know you anyway, so it's great to be with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| And looking forward to this time together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| This slide show is going to give us a background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| Everybody's set up, so we're going to go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| I think Commissioner Norman has done a good job of kind of doing an introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| The background we're going to go into, and he gave a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| One housekeeping item, a very important one that we still need to do is acknowledge the task force members that have attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=944)|
| 0:15:52| and I'm going to go through the names that I have, and if we missed anybody, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| I have Wayne Loveday, who's on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| His day job is with Knoxville Utility Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| Wayne is over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Thank you, Wayne, for standing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Next to Wayne is Cindy Pionkey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Most of you know Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Does a great job with Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| And then Mr. Bart Carey is wearing two hats today, MPC commissioner and task force member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=975)|
| 0:16:22| And then Gary Norvell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| There, Gary Norvell with his surveying and engineering company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| He's been a great task force member in addition to that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=989)|
| 0:16:38| Bear with me because I've not done this slide show before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| and I haven't even seen this particular one presented, but it's a variation on ones that we've been using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1002)|
| 0:16:50| The background has this slide just says we're going to be talking about characteristics and concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| and I think Commissioner Norman has already addressed some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| You know, we have a valley and ridge system here that is unique in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| It defines the character of our region and the beauty of the aesthetic values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| but also presents some environmental challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| And the task force has spent a good bit of time trying to address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| And I want to point out here, I mentioned aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| Aesthetics is always part of what I think gets folks' attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| and it's a legitimate concern to a degree, but we're talking a lot more than aesthetics here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| in terms of impacts of ridgetop development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| And you'll see as we go through this slide show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| there's some very real concerns in terms of environmental impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| and in terms of the cost of infrastructure development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| So let's just move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| Here's an example of some of the valley and ridge system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| It's pretty unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| The valley floors tend to be flat in a lot of places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| and then these distinct ridge lines that run throughout the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| It's just a little different than, say, western North Carolina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| or a lot of the other adjacent areas in this state and other states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1093)|
| 0:18:21| Here's the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| And even on your monitors, it's hard to discern exactly what you're seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1103)|
| 0:18:30| but you can see in the colored areas, of course, I'm trying to make it out myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| but the orangish, reddish, brownish, whatever that color is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| really is the color that defines the ridge system itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| and the topography establishes where the most topographically defined areas are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| in the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| One of the concerns is conservation and natural beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| Another is maintaining our water resources and protecting those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| Another is habitat, meaning animal habitat, wild animal habitat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| but in another sense, human habitation too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| Addressing all these while at the same time making sure that we allow room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| for thoughtful, quality development throughout the county and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1158)|
| 0:19:25| Now, here's where we get into some of the problem areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| that have been a real motivator in terms of addressing these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| What you see here are slides from an area development called Wildwood Phase III| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| that's actually not in the city but is not that far from the city in South Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| an area near and dear to my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| Historically, we've seen some developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| Fortunately, not that many this egregious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| But this development shows that with traditional zoning and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1199)|
| 0:20:08| any old boy with a bulldozer can get out there and wreak havoc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| The results and the impacts leave everybody else picking up the pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1213)|
| 0:20:20| The impacts of this particular development, which basically, as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| they just took some very steeply, formally wooded, steep building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1225)|
| 0:20:33| what became building sites, ridgeland, and just simply scraped everything off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| and then cut out house seats and put in driveways that are so steep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| that some vehicles literally can't enter the driveways from the road or street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| because of the angle of the pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| They hang on their front bumpers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| And, of course, getting emergency equipment up there in some cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| is either impossible or very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| I'm not sure if we've got a slide or slides of some similar impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| These are actually not in Wildwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| These are other sites in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| But the impact of some of these practices is pretty severe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| especially on the steeper slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| Obviously, runoff and soil loss, not just runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| but actual sliding, slippage, slumping of the soil due to instability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1285)|
| 0:21:32| once the trees are gone and the site has been regraded can be a huge problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1292)|
| 0:21:40| By the way, these images are courtesy of Knox County Stormwater Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| Here's another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| This one's also in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| This is adjacent to a church that was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| If you look closely, you'll see that the entire slope is failing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| as portions of it cleave away and slump downslope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1318)|
| 0:22:05| So it's subject to a lot of failures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| and any kind of grading like this on these kinds of slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| With the kinds of soils that we have in this area, you've got that potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| Another thing that we've seen happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| this is actually in Sevier County adjacent to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| where we've seen a lot of steep slope development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| The potential for wildfire spread, current spread,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| and impact on development is pretty extensive, pretty severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| This is a series of residential properties that burned in a wildfire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| I think sometimes it's called the chimney effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| There may be another term for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Fire will start downslope typically and move upslope so fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1371)|
| 0:22:59| because of the hot air drafts that work their way up the slopes and up the draws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| that it creates almost a firestorm and is very difficult to fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1384)|
| 0:23:12| If it's just wooded land, it's a real loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| but as we know in wildfires, forest fires, it can recover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| The trees reseed eventually and there's recovery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| although sometimes it helps to assist that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| But when there are structures with people in them, it's a whole different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| Obviously, they're very difficult to protect as far as fire suppression and fire control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| and it puts the firefighters that are called on to protect those structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| and to try to do what they can to fulfill their obligations, puts them at great risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1428)|
| 0:23:55| Of course, the city of Knoxville has its own fire crews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| and so we're worried not only about the human impact in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| but it comes home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| It becomes much more personal as we think about our own firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| being put in these positions of risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| Another issue is air pollution, and this slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| these two slides are actually taken from a webcam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| that is close to some family property we have on the North Carolina side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| the Purchase Knob site, but it's all the Smoky Mountain area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| There's another webcam that you get similar images from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| on this side of the Smokies at Look Rock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| and you see these kinds of conditions where on clear days like today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| I assume I saw the webcams earlier, and it looked pretty much like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| On clear days, you get high visibility, long distances, 50 miles or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| and on other days, you get a significant haze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| and a lot of that haze is man-made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| although some of it is naturally generated in the trees themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| and what you find with the loss of tree cover, especially on slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| where a tremendous amount of regeneration as far as the atmosphere goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| oxygen production, filtering out of pollutants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| taking up carbon dioxide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| that happens with the tree, the forest cover in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| and especially on sloped areas where you get a high concentration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| and a lot of trees per acre because of the slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| and you get a lot of air movement up and down the slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| The task force recognized that a key issue in all of this is property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| and that has to be weighed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| and as a former member of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| and addressing members of this body and members of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| we all understand that that's a constant tension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| property rights versus community impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| and that's what land use regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| and land use guidelines are all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| You know, we don't exist in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| where property rights are absolute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| and are exercised without regard for the surrounding properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| or the community in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| We know that we have land use regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| we have subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| we have zoning code in the city and in the county of Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| and so the issue is not whether there are regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| of property use versus property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| It's where you find that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| That's the key question, and you all know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| so I don't need to beat that drum anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| but we recognize that as a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| We had a diversity of opinion on the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| addressing all these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| especially property rights versus overall community impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| and we wrestle with those continually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| and will continue to, as this body will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| or these bodies, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| And the plan, again, going back to what Mr. Donaldson said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| this is an advisory plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| We are not talking about zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| We're asking for the adoption of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| We are not asking you at this point to adopt any regulatory measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| any zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| That hopefully will be addressed at some point in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| but that's not why we're here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| But the plan's purpose is to lay down principles, policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| and guidelines to help further the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| further the understanding of what these issues are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| to give guidance to MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| guidance, hopefully, to MPC commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| city council, and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| And the plan principles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| the first principle listed is conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| and restoration of forested ridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| for environmental and economic sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| And I want to interject something personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| about economic sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| This is a very sensitive issue, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| because personal property rights always have to be in the balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| I was very fortunate, thanks to my mother, my 93-year-old mother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| and her desire and willingness to take me with her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| I was just in Switzerland the first two weeks of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| Now, Switzerland is not East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| but Switzerland is part of the same planet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| and people in Switzerland, I noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| even though they speak different language for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| they're really just people like us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| and have a lot of the same concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| and a lot of the same political tugs and pulls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| on their communities and on individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| And one of the things, though, that they seem to have grasped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| and of course they've been dealing with these issues for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| is that they seem to have somewhat of a grasp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| on how do we allow development in a very topographically varied landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1759)|
| 0:29:27| and at the same time address people's rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| to develop their property, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| and at the same time not kill the goose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| because if there's any area that's subject to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| is sensitive to environmental impacts on the overall economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| because so much of their economy is tourism-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| it would be Switzerland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| And I just use that example to say, you know, we're not Switzerland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| but we have a beautiful area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| and we can learn from people that have been dealing with these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| a lot longer than we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| And again, what they've done is they've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| there's a constant tension there, but they've tried to find a balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| in terms of development versus overall community impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| and how that's going to impact their overall tourism economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| or economy in general, but mostly tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| And I think that they haven't done a perfect job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| and there are examples there, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| and they have surprisingly some of the same issues that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| But they've obviously been thoughtful about it for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| and have had some successes in finding that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| Principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Again, another principle, reduce sprawl, maintain scenic resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| and create green belts through ridge conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| All these are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| We can talk about, and need to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| well, how do we address these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| and affect those particular sub-issues or areas of concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| I've heard, well, if we restrict ridge shop and hillside development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| that's going to drive development further out into other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| and will create sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| Well, that's a reasonable item to debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| I personally think that there are answers to those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| that allow us to address both concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| How do we maintain scenic resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| I won't go any further into that at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| but I think that that is critical for the economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| as well as the general viability of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| And creating green belts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| we're not talking about government coming in and taking people's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| We're talking about encouraging, incentivizing, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| And you all know all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| You've been through greenway, approved greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| particular greenway projects, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| and you know how that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| and how some of our parks and park systems work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| And you just went through a discussion recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| about rezoning some parkland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| and whether or not non-parkland should be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Again, that same tension is there, but it's a healthy discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| Let me know if I'm going too slow, by the way, anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| Moving along hillside and ridgetop protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| this map was developed by the MPCGIS staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| Tim Coon and others on the MPCGIS staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| They put a tremendous amount of time and energy into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| and utilized tools that they developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| and also tools and techniques that they gleaned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| from other areas in the country that have done similar things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| in Arkansas and other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| and tried to define, now that we have the tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| that we didn't have when the MPC's old ridgetop protection plan was developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| we have much more effective and sophisticated tools now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| to understand what the topography is and what the impacts might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| Plan policies and guidelines, overall policies suggested in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| the steeper the slope, the lesser the housing density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| Steeper the slope, lesser the land disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| Natural beauty of ridgetops is worth conserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| We at the task force, the majority of members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| and you'll see this later, voted to approve this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| and send it on to MPC and therefore City Council and County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| So the majority supported these overall policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| which are, these are frameworks, these are concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| Do we all agree on these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| Well, we don't know until we have that dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| but I would hope that all council members would agree on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| and MPC commission members would agree on these to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| Policies for low density residential, 15 to 25 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| two dwelling units per acre, which is where we stand right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| 25 to 40 percent, one dwelling unit per two acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| which is where things stand right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| 40 to 50 percent, we're getting into really steep slopes here, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| One dwelling unit per four acres, that's a new recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| That does not exist under the present slope protection guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| And then over 50 percent, no development, and that's a new proposed policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2064)|
| 0:34:31| Again, these are just guidelines at this point, if this is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| Potential effect of the policies on housing and population growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| 82,000 undeveloped acres in the hillside and ridge protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| could accommodate 76,000 new dwelling units or 190,000 residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| under these new policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| 103,000 dwelling units or 230,000 residents on vacant land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| could be developed on vacant land within Knox County, that's city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| outside the hillside and ridge top protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| In summary, 200,000 dwelling units or 46,000, 465,000, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2113)|
| 0:35:21| additional residents could be accommodated using this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| And again, that excludes Farragut, South Waterfront, and other redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| Those were not considered in this analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| Building heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| That really doesn't change a lot from at least the cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| I'm not as familiar with the counties, but it's very similar to where we're at now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Maximum building height measured from the average natural grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| is 35 feet, and that's to the midpoint of the roof line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| I know you all have encountered that before because that's, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| pretty much where we're still at with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| Low density and rural residential proposing to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| terrain adaptive architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| Of course, the plan at this point would not mandate anything at that level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| but it would point out, it would graphically represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| and encourage this kind of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| And hopefully with those suggestions, many would take them to heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| and do that because what it will probably do, my guess at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| is it will create a product for developers that will be more attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| and more marketable, especially as we see more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| And as the task force did its work, we did a tour, a site visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| to Asheville, North Carolina, and saw what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| They actually have regulations and ordinances in place there with their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| But their plan allows a lot of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| In fact, this slide is from a development in that general vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| close to Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| And I think there may even be another slide of one of the developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| we saw in Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Yes, this is one we saw in Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| And apparently these are working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| They're popular, as indicated by the market for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| Well, that was before the real estate market busted completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| So it could have changed just as much as it did anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| But that's sort of somewhat irrelevant right now because those conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| are affecting all real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| But they apparently sold well and are working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| Then what they've done is address parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| You can see this separate parking bench that it's pull in, back out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| or back in, pull out from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| And I know sometimes the engineering people worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| My personal opinion is that in low-volume streets like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| where you have good visibility and good sight distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| it's really not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| And I can tell you that not only do we see a lot of successful developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| in this country, but they do it a lot in Switzerland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| And it works well there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| And there's a lot of traffic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| Sorry, there was one other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Tree preservation encouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| And they did a lot on this particular development to try to preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| existing trees on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| Medium-density residential and office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| Try to concentrate development on the toe of the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| And the idea here is to move towards incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| even in hopefully eventually in the zoning code itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| where you don't take away people's right to develop property at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| in terms of densities, but you simply encourage clustering the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| and concentrating it in areas where it will have less impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| And interestingly enough, as the task force has done its work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| in talking to people in the development industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| the feedback is that we really don't want to develop on slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| if we have an alternative because it's more expensive, more difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| a lot more headaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| And so if you can give us higher densities in places like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| at the toes of slopes, that's really what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| We heard that more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| Medium-density residential and office uses, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| allow MDR and office uses on slopes 15% to 25% with reduced setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2369)|
| 0:39:35| Again, also maximum building footprints of 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| Well, the reduced setbacks are simply to encourage building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| in a way that's more sensitive to the slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| where you're not constrained by having to set further back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| into or up on the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| And the footprint, again, this is debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| I think it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| One of the issues, too, in addition to the footprint of the building itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| is parking, and sometimes that's a bigger issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| than the building footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| And that is addressed in part on this slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| One of the ways to minimize parking and right-of-way or road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| or driveway impacts is to allow narrower pavement widths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| and smaller setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| And another is to encourage under-building parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| which can be done as long as you have the room vertically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| And so that's one of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| If this is going to work, we've got to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| if we go to the regulatory stage, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| that our regulations allow adequate building height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| to allow that vertical density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| so that the overall footprint impact is reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| Recommended programs and proposed code changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| In addition to zoning, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| both the city and the county has subdivision regs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| Revised hillside roadway standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| rights-of-way 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| And that's a reduction from our present 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| That's what I was going to say, but I wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| I've slept a few times since we last talked about that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| Pavement width 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| or typically 30 feet or more, I think, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| Or 26, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| Okay, so it's just a six-foot reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Road grade, city 12%, county 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| A 15% road grade is fairly steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| And in driveway grade, 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| And you remember the driveways we saw in Wildwood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| I don't know, I don't remember what those were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| but they were 30 and above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| which gets pretty out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| But with these recommendations for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| again, these are for the subdivision regs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| and not for zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| but they would still need to be approved by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| if not codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| Conservation subdivision program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| This is another approach to lessening impacts overall on sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| whether they're topographically varied sites or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| but they're especially valuable for sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| that have significant topography changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| Primary open spaces, slopes in excess of 25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| floodplains and farmland would be protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| and essentially not developed with this approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| using a conservation subdivision that met these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| And the density determination, minimum lot sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| the zone district divided into the parcel size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| to determine density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| Basically, if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| you take the overall development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| and you can see instead of parceling out the entire development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| you have a formula that allows you smaller parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| as a percentage of the overall site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| and those parcels are concentrated in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| where the impacts are less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| One of the great things about conservation subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| well, you can see you get a bonus provision under this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| where you can actually develop more lots overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| up to 20% more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| but one of the great things is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| the sense you have typically in a good conservation subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| is it feels as good or better than a typical subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| because you look out your backyard and you've got a natural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| Now, it's a common natural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| There are different ways of governing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| Typically, it's owned in common by those that are subdivision parcel owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| but it's protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| It can have trails or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| There are all sorts of ways of shaping and forming this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| but the concept, I think, is very valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| Low-density residential density bonus provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| Going back to what was referred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| in the conservation subdivision slide previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| bonus density of up to 20%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| for conservation easement with public access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| and this particular development is in North Carolina also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| but, again, the approach allows you to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| greater overall density, more parcels, more lots, more houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| and at the same time preserve natural areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| especially those areas that are steepest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| In land disturbance provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| clearing limits should be established within a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| so that as the developer submits a development plan for a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| those clearing limits would be established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| based on these guidelines within that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| so that 15 to 25% slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| the proposal is to limit the disturbance to 50% of the lot or the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| and then, of course, 25 to 40 would be 15%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| 40 to 50, 10%, and over 50%, zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| just as there would be no development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| no houses, no buildings allowed on any parcel that was over 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| Ridgetop conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| making the distinction here between hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| and the actual top of the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| Now, the ridgetops vary in Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| because of the geology we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| Some are what we call knife-edge ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| There's really nothing flat on the top at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| but others vary, and then some have broader ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| but the idea is to limit the clearing on the ridgetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| so that we don't create scraped-off scars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| and limited clearing within 100 feet of the ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| You can see by the graphic example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| that it just simply lowers the visual impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| Considerations for land disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| delineation of a disturbance area within the plot plan for each lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2783)|
| 0:46:31| clearing limits in relation to slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| Again, you saw the numbers earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| but that would apply to individual parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| Geotechnical analysis for potential hazard areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| I mentioned this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| The soils that we have in Knoxville and Knox County vary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| but there are some that are very subject to failure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| if they're disturbed in some of the ways we've seen in earlier slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| And then reforestation and landscaping requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| that in some cases, yeah, they scrape it off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| but because they need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| In order to do a practical development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| sometimes you just have to clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| more than just where the building site is itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| but some reforestation and landscaping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| And also a change to the stormwater regulations is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| Again, this is just a plan. It's guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| But down the road, we're proposing that we look at doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| And, of course, you know, in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| that's not zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| That's another part of the code and comes under engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| But it can be addressed in the zoning code also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| Wider hillside buffers in relation to steeper slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| And the graphic pretty much explains that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| The steeper it is, the further back you'd have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| from the actual stream or, you know, water body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| before you could disturb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| And integrate clearing limits into the stormwater program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| I think that's sort of a logical thing to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| Reforestation management practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| Try to save topsoil and rock wherever possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| rather than pushing them off and burying them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| hauling them off, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| Because if you don't have good topsoil, everybody knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| nothing's going to grow well in trying to reestablish ground cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| Natural landforms mimicked so that we don't just come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| and change it dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| We try to encourage going back around the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| but going back as close as possible and reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| to the original topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| Final surface lightly graded, loosely distributed topsoil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| and rock material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Those are good practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| The slides you see on the right were documentation of techniques| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| that were developed by the U.S. Office of Surface Mining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| and some pretty good techniques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| When you don't have heavy equipment compacting the topsoil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| and you make sure that the top layers of soil are, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| kept loose as they're distributed and redistributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| and that there's some rock material in there to stabilize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| it makes a tremendous difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| You don't get the soil loss, the erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| Trees and plants actually can grow because the soil's not compacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| Ground cover should be planted with perennial rye grasses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| and legumes and a variety of native trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| Those are just good suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| Proposed administrative and related programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| zoning and plans review proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| Again, this is not what the plan would mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| It's just what it would suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| Planned zone districts with rezoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| We all know about planned zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| Whether it's an RP1 or any of the other planned districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| requires use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| Plans review and permitting, hillside overlay, zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| Anything, if we go there, and again, this is just a suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| at this point, and if you approve this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| that just means we're going to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Doesn't mean you'll approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| But the idea is to look at potentially approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| a hillside overlay zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| That's one way of approaching it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| In other words, we keep the base zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| and then come back with an overlay zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| Just like H1 historic zone, NC1, F1 flood, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| You all know all about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| Standard review under the building permit processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| so that basically we don't create any special review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| It's all built into the existing review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| Special hillside development zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| that's another option as opposed to an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| As you can see, there are different ways of approaching this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| One is not necessarily better than the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| if you all should decide to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| Utility district responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| because this is countywide, that's the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| the language says utility districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| As we know, inside the city of Knoxville, we have KUP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| Addressing future water supply is a part of this overall effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| so that that's not something that's siloed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| and addressed separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| That's what we saw happen with the water tower in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| There was just a disconnect there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| and there was no way of tying them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Hopefully there will be a way, even though we do know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| that the utilities are not subject to local zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| Tank and tower locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| a consortium of all water utility districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| creating a countywide water supply sufficiency map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| It's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| It's challenging to try to herd all those cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| but all the utility districts and KUB together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| But it's not impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| I mean, they all have shared interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Everybody wants to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| They don't particularly like having to supply water to ridge tops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| It's very difficult and very expensive for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| So I think this is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| I can't speak for them, but in my perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| in the conversations we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| representatives of the utility districts and KUB on the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| and so far it sounds like this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| that we really can look at and talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| Design, location, and public review of utility district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Avoid ridge crests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| You can see the example on the top one of a tank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| that's not right on the crest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| It's very close, but it's in a little bit of a saddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| And in the summertime, when those trees have leaves on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| you're not going to see much of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| In wintertime, you'll see a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| but it's dramatically different than the South Knoxville Water Tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| that you see in the lower photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| Blending with natural vegetation, landscape vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| screening, earth tone, paint, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| There are some issues, I think, in terms of paint durability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| We've talked about that in terms of water temperature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| depending on all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| But these are things that just need to be worked through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| Public meetings hosted by a utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| within potentially affected communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| or a public meeting before MPC at utility's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| Just ways of integrating the utilities into the overall process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| If we hadn't had the problem in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| it wouldn't have flagged it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| At some point, it would have come up somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| But now that we've been through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| I think there's a greater sensitivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| and the question is, well, how do we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| These are some suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| Ridge conservation corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| A blend of low-density uses and dedicated open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| And the graphic on the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| is actually a graphic that was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| by the East Tennessee Community Design Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| for Legacy Parks Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| showing potential connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| between the different urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| and historic corridor parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| and the overall community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| But the idea is to really begin to address these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| in a thoughtful way, in an integrated way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| And in terms of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| looking at hillside conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| and development standards in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| Looking at identifying ridge corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| and trail easement acquisition opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| Again, we're not talking about mandating anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| taking through zoning and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| you can only have a trail on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| We're talking about encouraging land donations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| encouraging land acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| through mechanisms like Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| A variety of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| As we know, many times the greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| in the city of Knoxville are established on easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| rather than that property being acquired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| fee simple by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| The landowner provides an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| Linkages between ridge conservation corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| and natural and wildlife management areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| I think that's self-explanatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| The slide at the bottom, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| is the Ross Marble property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| the newest acquisition to the Iams Nature Center complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| Ridge conservation corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| a blend of low-density uses and dedicated open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| Conserve key hillside and ridgetop areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| as connected public green space system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Well, I think I've already pretty much covered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| Again, the slide has the kind of awkwardly placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| dash line laying across what we now know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| is key areas of the ridgetop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| the urban wilderness historic corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| preservation area, much of which is ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| Okay, the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| These efforts were brought to you courtesy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| Forestry Division and the U.S. Forest Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| U.S. Department of Agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| through a grant, a federal grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| that was managed and allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| by the state of Tennessee's forestry division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| So they paid for some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| This process, as you can imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| has involved, over the last two years or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| has involved a tremendous amount of time and effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| and work by MPC staff, volunteers, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| And I'll just tell you that the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| has exceeded the grant money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| But there should be no surprise there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| Anyway, but it's been great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| It's been a great process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| And that's the end of the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| Somebody can figure out how to get the lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| Always livens things up a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| Are there questions from commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| or council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| A lot of information to digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| Again, we do have copies of the report available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| If people want more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| Questions from anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| Mr. Della Voppe has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| Overcoming my shyness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| Well, one of the things that I think is interesting about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| maybe partly comment, is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| and Joe mentioned this several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| is that this is not self-enforcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| This is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| And I wanted to commend MPC and all the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| that worked on this because simply as a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| it brings together a lot of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| that we can all use, whether we're in government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| whether we're developers or landowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| about what good practices are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| And I think that's really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| And I think that having that resource is a valuable thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| I guess we're going to confront the other part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| which is will property owners resist this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| as a zoning or ordinance-type measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| But I do appreciate all the work that went into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| and attended some of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| And it was obvious that there are some strongly felt feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| out there in the developing community about what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| But I think with the bonuses and the other options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| I think it really is a wonderful tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| to preserve what's valuable for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| I'll skip the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| Let me ask just real quick for Tony or Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| You mentioned at some point that there wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| complete agreement from the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| Can you say a few more words about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| and sort of what the task force came down on or didn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| Okay, you've got a list of the task force members in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| The count that I had was 21 to three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| the last count of those members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| Twenty-one in favor, three opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| And we certainly thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| and as you surveyed those members of the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| wow, I just go, wow, that's an impressive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| impressive group of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| both from a professional standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| and from a commitment to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| So many of those people on that task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| have just been absolutely active in their life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3569)|
| 0:59:36| and committed to various enterprises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| in this community for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| So anyway, that was the vote, 21 to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| And I just thought that was an extremely strong endorsement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| Ms. Longmeyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| Oh, Mr. Stowers, oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| You did, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| A quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| This is titled a hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| Much of what we're discussing, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| I want to compliment the task force on, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| one of the major attractions of this area are our hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| and the ridges and the views in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| The question I have, is this focused on hillside and ridgetop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| The way I do the calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| it's going to encompass about 70% of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| So is it more of a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| or is it focused on ridgetops, hillsides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| Mr. Stowers, I think maybe Mr. Donaldson can address those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| better than I can because he's been closer to the analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| Can you handle that, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| I'll let Liz or Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| Okay, I'm sorry, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| The math that you saw as far as the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| and ridgetop protection area is about 38% of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| And there is a table on page 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3676)|
| 1:01:24| That's what I'm looking at there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| And it breaks it down by the percentages of slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| within the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| but that's only 38% of the overall county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| So you've got 72% that's not in the area at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| The question I've had, and I'm trying to put my arms around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| I recognize this is just a draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| but the different models, you had revision one, revision two, revision three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| breaking the sectors down by 20 acres down to five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| What happens if you use a 20-acre sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| Does that increase or decrease the amount of property covered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| I'm going to let or I'm going to ask Tim Kuhn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| who was the GIS person that did the modeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| and how that was tested to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| Because this is going to be something from the MPC's point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| we're all going to have to have a real clear understanding of how some of these models go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| because numbers have power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| What is included in one of the appendixes is kind of the steps that we went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| as we looked at the model that Fayetteville used, Fayetteville, Arkansas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| the University of Arkansas developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| We went through some revisions that we thought maybe improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| the consistency of the output for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| Fayetteville started with what's called, you're referring to a 20-acre slope group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| That is 20 contiguous acres of slope that are over 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| We did run models with the 20-acre slope groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| What we saw was inconsistency in the output in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| one side of a ridge being included, the other not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| or the ridge being broken where you'd have a long face of a ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| that continued for a mile or so, then it would stop and then would break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3788)|
| 1:03:15| Well, my question is if you use 5 acres versus 20, does that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| If you use 5 acres, you cover more land than you do if you cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| Okay, that answers that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| 20-acre slope group as a basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| Another comment I'll have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| I think everybody can look at some of these pictures in here and they're egregious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| We have rules and laws today on stormwater runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| that are sometimes enforced very stringently and other times are totally ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| When you see some of these examples, I would caution the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| to make these as representative of what is being done in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| I think both of these are clear violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| and I would suspect there's fines and actions having to be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| before the property can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| The question I have is on these water buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| TDEC has some very stringent rules today already on discharge into streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| What is the task force suggesting that would be more stringent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| than what TDEC already mandates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Because you have to have an NPDES permit for any discharge, a grading permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| Then you have to have a stormwater permit retention bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| And having built several commercial buildings for my own business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| we've got a couple million dollars already invested in stormwater and NPDES issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| and I support those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| We want clean water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| But is the water today cleaner than it was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| What are we trying to do that's not already in law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| Mr. Stowers, I think those are really good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| Under the present regulations and permitting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| the basic technical issues are addressed in terms of water impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| But sometimes the impacts on the rest of the site can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| well, it may be a matter of opinion, but I think it goes beyond opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| can be somewhat adverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| And I'll give you an example that I'm aware of, just one that comes to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| On the western section of Sharps Ridge, where the newest television tower is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| there's actually two things going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| There's the previous borrow pit on this side that was used for highway construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| which I don't know if TDOT gave the contractor some sort of waiver of local regs on that or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3942)|
| 1:05:49| but it was somewhat egregious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| But aside from that, what happened later with the tower construction itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| is that the people that were building the tower wanted to put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| and Doug Berry was involved with, oh, what's the engineering firm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| Anyway, I can't remember, but they were the engineers for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| And they wanted to put what they considered to be a low-impact access road in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| that would not have been paved and would have had water bars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| would have had, they said, would have met all the requirements technically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| to satisfy the NPDES permits, but it didn't meet the city's requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| So they had to put in basically a two-lane street working its way up that slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=3994)|
| 1:06:41| with major catchment areas, retention ponds, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| It had a tremendous impact on that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| And so one of the questions is, how can we meet those water quality requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| without just tearing everything up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| And how are regulations becoming counterproductive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| Are there alternatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| Now, that may not be a complete answer to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| but I think it does address the point to a degree that that's one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| that we're trying to accomplish here is find ways to meet the goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| and the principles we've laid out here to satisfy the EPA, the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| local regulations in terms of NPDES, all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| and make it all work to where the community really benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| and where we don't add extra cost, we don't add extra impact on the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| we don't add visual blight, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Does that help at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| I think the problem is everything in here is subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| And, you know, before this thing is ready to be voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| I think there needs to be some clarity on what is expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| I agree with everything you just said on a situation such as that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| where you're going to do a lot more damage trying to put in a retention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| than you would doing perhaps design it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| Another question that is not addressed here, I'm sorry, go ahead, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| Well, I'm sorry, I hold that thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| But just going back to the subjectivity, remember, this is a plan for guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| When we get in, if we ever get to the regulatory stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| that's when the subjectivity has to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| You're describing subjectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| I would sort of balance that term with generality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| In other words, there's some general concepts here, to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| that aren't tightly defined yet, and that's because it's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| It's a guidance document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| And so just, you know, let's try to keep that in mind as we work through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| Okay, but these things tend to have mission creep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| and that's something that we need to be very careful about is that we, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| if we have a good plan that has buy-in from all the stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| you could end up, I think, having a lot more success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| in getting some of these things codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| One final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| I'm going to shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| I've been taking too much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| This is very residentially focused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| and I've got some good ideas in some of the eyes of the beholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| But what about commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| If you've got to come up with a 100-acre site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| you know, we do have to have commercial development to have jobs at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| What do you do with a commercial site where you've got to make it flat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4160)|
| 1:09:26| and it's a 100-acre site, and you're doing it with five-acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| I mean, all these, the tree issues and the site issues, that's something to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4170)|
| 1:09:37| and I've read this now five times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| and I really am having a hard time seeing how you all are driving commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4179)|
| 1:09:46| We talk about footprints of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| These are small buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| What about a factory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| What about a Volkswagen plant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| Well, Volkswagen was a pretty unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| It was, and Bacher's getting ready to build one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| Major site, right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| We could have a major site here or somewhere in this region or a brownfield that we'd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4202)|
| 1:10:08| I'm just asking, what if it's a small site like 100 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| Volkswagen was several hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| But a 100-acre site, how is, I think we need to make sure we address the method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| or the suggested methodology in this thing for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| No one's going to build that on top of a ridge, I wouldn't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| What they might do is try to remove the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| But what's a ridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| A 15 percent slope is a very mild slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| This 15 to 25 percent definition opens Pandora's box without some clarity on how those are going to be interpreted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4236)|
| 1:10:47| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| I was out of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| I would have been here at the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| I understand that you brought up that concern and really kind of hammered on it, and that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| Again, this is a guidance document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| and 15 percent would not be dealt with the same way 25 percent would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| even in general staff recommendations is my understanding from all our conversations with the staff, just for starters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4265)|
| 1:11:12| And certainly, if and when we get to a regulatory stage and consider ordinances and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4272)|
| 1:11:19| I think that's got to be looked at a lot more closely, and you can't have one size fits all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| As far as commercial development goes, I think it's going to be challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| but I have seen wonderful commercial development that was more site sensitive than what we often see around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4292)|
| 1:11:41| One of the things that you'll find, and I've seen a great slide show by a guy that's with the Urban Land Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4301)|
| 1:11:48| His name is Ed McMahon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| It's not the guy with the Publisher's Clearinghouse Checks, or used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| But he shows examples of commercial developments, everything from Walmarts to fast foods to banks, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4315)|
| 1:12:04| that have had to comply with local zoning ordinances of various kinds to reduce impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| Now, some of those are historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| Some of those are just, you know, building materials and have nothing to do with the topic we're talking about tonight directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| But some of them did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| And it's interesting in a lot of those cases, he went through a lot of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4340)|
| 1:12:27| This man's been working with this stuff for 20 plus years, actually more than 30, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| But chains like McDonald's fought a lot of these originally, and then they lost the battles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4351)|
| 1:12:38| and he shows what they built and how these stores are grossing better than average a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| because people like the creative approaches that were used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| So there's no simple answer to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| But my answer is that I think if we're careful in thinking this through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| we will encourage those developers and those commercial entities to find creative ways to lessen their impact on the sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4376)|
| 1:13:07| And I've seen it in this country, and I've seen it in other countries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| And so I think we could possibly get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| I've lived in other countries for seven years of my life, too, and some places do it better than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| I'm still concerned that we've got an overall countywide development plan instead of a hillside ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4404)|
| 1:13:32| I think we've broadened the scope of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| and I think that's one of the concerns that people have is there isn't a lot of clarity in how this is going to play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4416)|
| 1:13:45| I hear what you're saying, but, again, you know, 30-something percent, roughly a third of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| That's a lot, but it's not the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| But if you take out the 15 to 25, you've taken half of that footprint out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| and you're still protecting the hillsides and ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| Well, again, we may never have a regulation that regulates 15 to 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4444)|
| 1:14:10| but is it worth having some guidance in the plan to get everybody to look a little more closely at what can be done in that slope range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4450)|
| 1:14:20| I think it probably is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| And whether we get there on a regulatory standpoint or not, that's a real good, that's going to be a great discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4462)|
| 1:14:30| Let me, before we go to the next people who have their lights on, let me do a housekeeping piece for folks who came in later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4470)|
| 1:14:37| If you're interested in speaking in public forum, we have a sign-up sheet over here on the end list to Susan Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4477)|
| 1:14:45| I think Ms. Longmire is next, and then Ms. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| Ms. Longmire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| My question, I have two questions, actually, at least, have to do with the 15 to 25 percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4490)|
| 1:14:57| Can somebody give me a visual on a 15 to 25 percent slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| What's a 15 percent? What's a 25 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| I have to look at stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| I can give you a visual of what about a 23 percent slope is, is walnut out here by the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4506)|
| 1:15:13| That you can't go up when it's wet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| Yeah, it's about 23.5, 23.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| Okay, but a 15 then would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| My engineer over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| Have you been over to the Knox County Parks and Recreation offices near the Young-Williams Animal Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| I would say the slope leading up to that is probably in the range of 15, and it probably gets on up to 25 because it gets pretty steep behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4534)|
| 1:15:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| Is there not a difference in a 15 percent slope on certain types of soil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4546)|
| 1:15:55| Will we be having to deal with agronomists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Because I know some soil is more prone to slippage than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| Has that been taken into consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| Yes, we worked with the Natural Resources Conservation Service to map soil slippage potential across the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4564)|
| 1:16:14| And generally the high slip potential soils are in the steeper areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| So we see those starting at around probably 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| The medium potential soils for slippage or landslide probability are anywhere from 15 to 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4583)|
| 1:16:33| Well, I drive through the gap on McAnally Ridge and the trees are marching down that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| So I knew there was a difference somewhere in the soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| Commissioner Longmire, to follow up on that, the maps that were referenced, the USGS maps or the soil maps, I should say, are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4602)|
| 1:16:53| I mean, there's a lot of great work that's been done over the years to try to identify those soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| But certainly if we get to the point of regulatory instruments, you know, ordinances and such and zoning controls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4618)|
| 1:17:06| anything like that, whether it's through zoning or another ordinance type mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| there would have to be allowance for engineering alternatives and soil testing, you know, core borings, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4631)|
| 1:17:19| Because if somebody says, well, yeah, that's what the map says, we've been out on that property and we don't believe those soils are that bad or that unstable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4639)|
| 1:17:28| Well, they have to have an alternative to be able to say, okay, here's what's really there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| And, you know, they just hire their engineering firm and they establish they can challenge the map and say, well, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| but this is what's actually tested out on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| That would be my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| I'm not speaking for the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| What effect would this have on the current codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| Would codes not have to be changed in order to maybe implement some of this planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4667)|
| 1:17:54| Yeah, that's what we've been saying, that this is just a guidance document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| It would, in terms of staff recommendations to the MPC and to the elected bodies, the staff would use this as guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4678)|
| 1:18:07| certainly on planned districts, you know, where there's more leeway or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4687)|
| 1:18:14| But it wouldn't have the rule of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| That's a whole separate step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| Well, I do appreciate the work of the people, all of the people, both on the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| and also all the people who came to the meetings to give input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| I think it's important that it be a countywide plan because if we do piecemeal, it will continue to be as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| So I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| Ms. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| In this report, it mentions other cities, states that have done this kind of ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4724)|
| 1:18:51| Specifically, Asheville has been doing this since the 1980s and recently made more stringent rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| So did this task force have an opportunity to benchmark and visit Asheville or talk to people in Asheville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| And if so, surely they had the same issues with property rights and development that we have questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| Was there something gained from that experience that we could benefit from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| I think I mentioned earlier that we, I don't know if you heard this or not if you were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| but we took a group of task force members, not the entire task force, but several task force members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| took a van load and went to Asheville and met with their staff and they gave us a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4767)|
| 1:19:33| And then we went out and looked at specific sites to get some ideas and examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| And some of them were pretty challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| It's not that they don't develop, but they do regulate it more than they used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| and it does seem to be having some very positive impacts because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| And they do have regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| I mean, there are actually zoning ordinances that address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| And we've also, as Tim Coon mentioned, looked at Fayetteville, Arkansas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| And is it White County, Georgia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| White County, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| And I think there's some other examples that we've looked at, too, around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| Those are the main ones where we focus most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| And, of course, Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| And there was also a site visit to Gatlinburg, which has regulations now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| I wasn't able to go on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| I did go on the Asheville one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| And in that visit, did you pick up on why they felt it necessary to step up those regulations recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4824)|
| 1:20:33| I mean, what drove that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| Were there specific issues that made that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| Well, they showed in the presentation we had at their offices before we went out in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| they showed us a slideshow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| They did a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| And, yes, there were some egregious examples that had triggered that level of concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4848)|
| 1:20:55| and caused them to say, well, we better go back and address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| And one of the interesting things is the state of North Carolina, several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| passed a law that technically it's a statewide law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| but it's very specific in that it defines certain mountaintops based on overall elevation, I think, and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4868)|
| 1:21:17| That law, there had been attempts in the past to pass a law like that, and they just didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4877)|
| 1:21:25| And then there was a development that happened up around, you can see it from Grandfather Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| Do you know the name of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| Remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| Anyway, it's one of the mountaintops, Mowing Rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| You can see it from Grandfather Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| And right smack dab on top of the ridge, they built a, was it eight story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4900)|
| 1:21:48| It's 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| Oh, excuse me, 16 story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| Big Soviet block looking apartment slash condo building right on top of the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4913)|
| 1:22:01| And that sent shutters, I guess, throughout the state that if this is what we're going to be seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4921)|
| 1:22:08| maybe we do need to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| And the law that didn't pass before passed in the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| And it doesn't prohibit ridgetop development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| but it says you can't build something that tall on a ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| This is Liz Albertson again with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Just a point of information also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| Western North Carolina experienced a series of heavy rain events, and there were several landslide incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| So it wasn't necessarily just Asheville upping their regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| It was all over the Western North Carolina area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| The Land of Sky Regional Council put out a guiding document very similar to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| and then each municipality went and adopted their own separate ordinances based on those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| Next on my list is Mr. Ewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| I've just got one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| In the commercial part of this, it says that commercial and industrial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| or clearing for those uses shall be prohibited on slopes exceeding 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| Would the city county building have been built under this guideline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=4992)|
| 1:23:20| I would say the answer to that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| And do you feel that that is a bad development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5004)|
| 1:23:33| For an urban area like this, a dense downtown urban area, it's a reasonable development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5013)|
| 1:23:41| You're an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| I don't think we need to get into whether or not it's good architecture or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| I have my own opinions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| But I think I know where you're going with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| Is it reasonable to develop a site like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| And in an urban area, I would say that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| But it's still what you've done is globally said 15 percent or above is prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5035)|
| 1:24:03| So it doesn't make any difference if it's an urban setting or a rural setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| Well, that was the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| Again, it's subject to further scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| It's subject to further definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| It's subject to whether or not we think it's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| But this was, you know, the idea was let's talk about commercial developments on lower slope areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5060)|
| 1:24:27| And going back to Mr. Stowers' points, are there other ways of doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| Well, maybe there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| And maybe we can look at it more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| This, again, is a conceptual document, a guidance document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| Before we ever get to the regulatory stage, we really do need to look at best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| and how those things are best dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| Another issue relative to that, George, that I always think of is commercially zoned land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5089)|
| 1:24:56| that we have right now available that's unoccupied, vacated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5096)|
| 1:25:03| I've heard estimates of decades' worth of land that we will not need to rezone commercially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5103)|
| 1:25:13| because of what we have available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| So the issue is definitely, I think, in concept, we want to increase density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5116)|
| 1:25:23| We want to move development in, closer in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| We want to maintain green spaces as much as we can in the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| And I think when it gets down to it, when it gets down to the permitting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| the plans review process, you're going to see or we hope that that spirit of urbanization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5138)|
| 1:25:47| and increasing density in the inner core of our community will be upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5147)|
| 1:25:55| So, you know, I'm not sure how that will work out in code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| but hopefully we have staff that understands those concepts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5160)|
| 1:26:07| and we have the regulatory apparatus to encourage that to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5167)|
| 1:26:14| And that's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| Next person on my list is Mr. Delevaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5178)|
| 1:26:23| I wanted to ask Joe or one of the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| one of the most strident sets of comments we seem to hear in the task force meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| were an insistence that the average landowner is not paying attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5191)|
| 1:26:38| is not watching this process, is not getting the notice and coming to these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| and voicing their views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| And how will they know, I guess, before some regulatory scheme is adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5205)|
| 1:26:51| that their land is being affected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| Because there's some folks who stand up and, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| are pretty strident about the fact that you're taking away my rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| And you had that debate about what is reasonable regulation versus private land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| But how do you feel like you're going to deal with the notice question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| The first part of the notice thing that I'd like to mention is, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| this has been going on for two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| I've had some rather notorious battles that were front page news for weeks at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5241)|
| 1:27:33| in the process, in our public meeting process, of which we had 11 public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5253)|
| 1:27:42| And that's not to mention the other little meetings and presentations that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| that are not widely known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| So when I think about notification and some of the objections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| from some of the noisier folks about that issue, I just go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| well, if you don't know that there is activity that's taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5281)|
| 1:28:07| about hillside protection or ridgetop protection, you've been under a rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5287)|
| 1:28:13| You are not listening to, you're not reading the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| you're not listening to the radio, and you're not watching television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| Now, we may go out and try to notice these people by postcard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| every single individual that would fall within maybe this supposed overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| But we've done some calculations about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| And that's in the $50,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| We don't have a budget for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| I don't think there's an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| There's no excuse for not, if you live in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| for not knowing that this is an activity that government is undertaking this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5328)|
| 1:28:58| Let me just follow up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| Is that okay, Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| I'll keep it brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| I agree with Commissioner Norman pretty much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| but I do think that we make every reasonable effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| We need to make every reasonable effort to get notice out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| especially if it's going to be a big overlay or a major rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5355)|
| 1:29:20| a general rezoning type effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| Again, you all have just been through a general rezoning on parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| or at least that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| So, you know, there's a tension there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| But I think should we spend $50,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| Well, that's your all's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| But the MPC doesn't have that in their budget right now for anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5378)|
| 1:29:44| Is it necessary to approve a plan like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| No, because it's not regulatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| It's not going to drop the hammer on anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| The next stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| That's when we need to talk about what reasonable notice is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| I've got Mr. Clancy, Ms. Palmer, and Mr. Stowers in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| So, Mr. Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| I don't have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5403)|
| 1:30:04| I just have a brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| Two-and-a-half years ago they built a water tower up on a hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| and it's an eyesore, no doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| It doesn't look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| But it seems like we've spent the last two-and-a-half years tearing the barn down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| because there was one rotten board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| We're going to spend another two-and-a-half years rebuilding the barn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| and leaving the rotten board in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| There's a lot of smart people on this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| and there's a lot of good work that was done with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| And I've gone over it several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| and there's a lot of good stuff that will come out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| But I think the full intent of everything that is in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5440)|
| 1:30:47| every time one of the MPC staff members looks at a development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| he thinks of these pictures of rolling dirt coming down the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| We have slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| It's administered by an extremely intelligent and efficient MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5457)|
| 1:31:05| They look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| Every single time a development comes in, they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| density here, no density up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| but we'll let you cluster a little bit more on the bottom side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| I really think that we should have spent more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| trying to figure out how to bring our utilities, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5482)|
| 1:31:30| I mean, a power line raked up the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| Tomorrow we could see a power line going up the side of the same hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| with a 40-foot swath of no trees going up it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| I think we need to look a little bit harder at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| I think that tomorrow KUB put another tank right next to that one if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5503)|
| 1:31:50| I think we need to talk more about and really put some teeth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| into how we let the utilities develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5514)|
| 1:31:59| Not that they shouldn't put a tower up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| but shouldn't we say submit a concept plan to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| so that we can look at it and say, no, no, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| And I know they're protected under all kinds of bylaws and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| but I really think we'd have done, at the end of it all, we've got this great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| Again, we've got some good stuff coming out of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| but we've still got a tower on the hill and we've still got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| we can still have another one tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| That's what started this whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| Mr. Clancy, let me respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| I think your points are well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| First of all, again, I'll reiterate that under state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| KUB and the utility districts are exempt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| exempt from zoning, local zoning regulations, absolutely exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5565)|
| 1:32:51| There is no local authority through zoning over what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| So what's done with them, at least right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| if and until state law changes, which, you know, that's not very likely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| at least in the immediate future, it's going to be cooperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| And one of the ways that you get to a cooperative effort is you have a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| and that's what we're in the midst of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| to build community consensus amongst decision makers, amongst general community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5597)|
| 1:33:24| And the same thing goes with the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| You're right, we have a great MPC staff, smart people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| They understand these issues pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| But do I believe that they did not, as a staff, benefit from this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5614)|
| 1:33:40| No, I believe they did benefit from the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| I believe they learned, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| But the other thing that the process does is it provides guidance to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| because they're not living in a bubble, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| because you deal with them all the time as commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| They have to be responsive to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| They have to be responsive to the general desires and tenor of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5639)|
| 1:34:05| and where the community thinks the priorities and values are and should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| So what this process does is take an issue that's been festering for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5649)|
| 1:34:16| and I think you got in late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| I don't think you heard Commissioner Norman's introductory statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| but he said this started for him long before the water tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| And it's just that was a catalytic event that triggered a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| and triggered this process to a large degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| But the process is valuable, and I think you acknowledge that to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5674)|
| 1:34:40| But that's what we're here for is to better clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| and define where the community is on these issues now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| and to have that dialogue, and we've been having that dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| and we're having that tonight, and this isn't the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| And I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| But at the same time, every single one we're trying to do is we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| and I know the intent is to urge people to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| but we're taking 15 to 25 percent slopes, which, again, this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| the University of Tennessee, none of that could have been built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| if somebody hadn't said, okay, here's a ridge top over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| What should we do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| Not every ridge top, every knife edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| every single thing in the county comes under these regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| Wouldn't it be smarter to take it ridge by ridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| Somebody wants to put a, I don't know, chalet village up on Sharps Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| How are you going to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| Let me see a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| Let's look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5740)|
| 1:35:41| Let's see what you intend to do and how you intend to build them this high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| and you can't build them any higher other than saying that's it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| blanket it, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| I think it's going to be really hard to get people on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| and I'll tell you another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| This is something that you just might want to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| This is a plan and this is East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| The good old boys up there that own all these ridges and mountains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| they think that their property values are going to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| They're going to crank up their bulldozers and they're going to start grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| That's probably going to happen unless you get it codified really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5776)|
| 1:36:23| Let me go ahead to, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| Did she have a point of information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| I just wanted to make a point of information that our current slope protection areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| in our sector plans start at 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| Mr. Stowers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| You know, again, this is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| Personally, I see a tremendous amount of good in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| but I would caution the committee whether people are under rocks or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| there's a process that needs to be followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| or we're going to lose all credibility in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| You've got a lot of property owners that own that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| and when suddenly they can't use it for the purpose for which they intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| especially stuff that's been in families a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| or something that's been bought speculatively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| to use a number like $50,000 like that's an insurmountable expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| People pay more than that for half an acre in many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| So I think we've got to be real careful to make sure this plan is ready for prime time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| before we approve it because it is going to go back into laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| and we're going to divide the community even further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| if we don't try to get a few more points of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| With all due respect, and I've looked over the list of folks, 21 to 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| you know, we could put together different groups with different backgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| and come up with a bunch of different votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| but in this plan itself it addresses the fact there were 200 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| and that's what's written in here, maybe there's been more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| who have been to these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| That's not exactly a broad spectrum of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| We all know how these meetings go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| People that have a direct interest come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| and most people assume they, meaning us, are going to do what's in their best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| And I just hope that we can broaden this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| and get some more input from the community at large before we're ready to vote on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5896)|
| 1:38:23| or reduce its scope to its initial mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| which Mr. Clancy put so well as to fix that rotten board that's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| Well, let me respond and then I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| Joe, Joe, can you respond briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| Commissioner Norman wants to say something, so I really need to give him time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| but I'll just say that what you're saying argues for passing this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| because it's just a document that allows us to do exactly what Commissioner Clancy suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5926)|
| 1:38:54| It does not create regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| It gives us, it helps point us in the direction of looking closely at these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| and doing exactly what Commissioner Clancy said, is looking at them on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| Now, when we, if and when we get to regulatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| Is this your plan or the community's plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| I mean, whose plan is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| We adopt a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| We're going to have an election Tuesday that's going to be a real referendum one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| We've got a health care bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| We'll read it after it passes and see what's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| We've got to be careful about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| But the city council, the county commission and MPC have an obligation to make sure what we pass as a, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5970)|
| 1:39:38| plan is the community's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| And I think there's a lot more in here that people can agree on than disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| but we've got to make sure the contentious issues are fully vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| My point, and I agree, but my point is simply that because it's not regulatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| one of the ways to deal with it, there's no perfect process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| but if we pass this, it has no weight of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| and therefore it creates the opportunity to have that very dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| Commissioner Norman, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| My only reaction to some of that is that a lot of times when we are out in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6006)|
| 1:40:14| and we have, admittedly, we have a relatively small segment of the population that comes to the public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6014)|
| 1:40:25| but for me, I mean, it depends on your perspective about how you want to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| One way you can look at it is, well, I think that there's a lot of people that are very comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6030)|
| 1:40:36| with the principles of this plan as they've been published,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| and when we do our surveys online and in those meetings, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6041)|
| 1:40:47| we get 80 and 90 percent approval of these principles in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| And so I think there's a comfort level in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| and that's reflected in the type of input that we get from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| Now, and from the other side, from the contrary side, or the real strident property rights folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6060)|
| 1:41:08| which I always like to think of, you know, like the mother of all borrow pits is on Callahan Road, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6068)|
| 1:41:19| And I always want to think about the property rights of those people that have residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6079)|
| 1:41:25| that are intermixed in between that slash on Callahan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6085)|
| 1:41:31| And I am so sensitive to those poor people who have lost all the value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6091)|
| 1:41:39| essentially they can't sell their land, they're stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| And so that's where, you know, we're thinking about property rights too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| We're always thinking about property rights, but we're thinking about not only the property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6107)|
| 1:41:55| the value or the speculative value of some development, we're thinking about other folks too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6115)|
| 1:42:02| Now, the other, and along with that, I think those folks, there's this, I have a feeling that what we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6122)|
| 1:42:09| we have a problem, and what we have had is a group that has come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6129)|
| 1:42:16| and they have a very creative, constructive solution to a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| and then we have a bunch of other folks that are sort of out on the edge that like to promote fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6141)|
| 1:42:27| And so this is sort of typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| I think it's a fear mongering, a what if, unintended consequences, all these terms like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6150)|
| 1:42:37| We're going to get to that regulatory stage, but I think there is a vast, vast majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6157)|
| 1:42:44| I wish we could survey every single person in Knox County for the principles of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6164)|
| 1:42:51| I think we would be shocked at how much approval we'd have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| I'm going to go to Councilman Becker, because he's got his light on, and then to Mr. Carey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| I guess I'm always concerned, Mr. Carey, where I hear you about this level of we've got to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| before we make these decisions, we've got to know what's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| But again, keep in mind, that's for everything we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| We said 200 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| That's more than we heard from when we passed that huge tax increase six, eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| At some level, I think hearing from 200 people is a lot from where we sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| And we're faced with this challenge of almost every decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| You know, Mr. King's sitting out there from engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| They built a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| That's changing people's value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| They fix a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| That changes people's value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| So we're sort of faced with the challenge of we have to make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| We've got to do a good job on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| I feel like the task force has done well on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| But also I feel like there are a lot of steps in the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| I mean, this is a plan that then leads to other changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| We're looking right now, we've asked MPC to consider a requirement that when there is a general rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| all the affected property owners have to be contacted, which is not something that I think is done now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| but is not codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| So we're looking at ways to continue involving people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| But I don't think it's fair to say, well, maybe not everybody knows about this, so let's not move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| Because if we did that, we'd never do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| So I'd be concerned about that as a, well, it's a good thought, it's perfection, but it's really hard to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6251)|
| 1:44:18| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| Mr. Cary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| As a member of the task force, I think it's good to look at the fact that in every meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6262)|
| 1:44:28| it wasn't just 20 to 40 people sitting around a room having loud discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6268)|
| 1:44:35| And a lot of times there were disagreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| But what's interesting, I think people need to understand, is there are subcommittee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| There were three subcommittees that met on a very regular basis throughout this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6281)|
| 1:44:46| I happened to sit on the land use committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| And we dealt with specifically some of these issues we're discussing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| And even though I voted in support of the plan, and I'm going to emphasize the word plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6292)|
| 1:45:01| throughout the process, I did have serious issues with the 15 to 25 percent slope area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6301)|
| 1:45:10| Ms. Longmeier, I guess you asked about what is 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| I would bet that the majority of the people in this room live on property with a 15 percent slope in your yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| Living in East Tennessee, you just about can't get away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| We're on almost a 24 percent slope where we sit today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| Many of the meetings we had were in buildings built on slopes of around 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| There are a number of great developments in this county, whether they be residential or commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| that are on slopes greater than 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6337)|
| 1:45:42| I don't want to beat this up too much, but I feel like one of our other big issues is how are we going to reach the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6342)|
| 1:45:50| to have an open forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| A $50,000 mail-out is maybe a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| In the process, we shrunk that overlay, if you will, that slope area was the 15 to 20 percent, let's say, was eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6357)|
| 1:46:06| I would suggest that a large number of people would be eliminated from that area that would, in turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6366)|
| 1:46:12| shrink the number of people that would be affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6372)|
| 1:46:17| and obviously shrink the portion, the 30 percent of the county that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| But, again, it's been a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| I think, overall, there's great things that Knox County can enjoy from this going forward, from this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6385)|
| 1:46:31| and we can build on it, but I do agree with a lot of things that have been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6391)|
| 1:46:36| that at least 15 to 20 seems to be really a lot to bite there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6396)|
| 1:46:42| Mr. Cain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| One of the things that, before I came to the meeting, and it seems to be still an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| is the case for the reasons for the 15 to 25 percent or even the 15 to 20 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6412)|
| 1:46:59| and it really did not come out at me, although there are some things in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6419)|
| 1:47:04| it seemed to be based upon a lot of other previous guidance in terms of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6424)|
| 1:47:11| One of the things that I do think is justification, but we haven't really talked about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6431)|
| 1:47:18| is the protection of the natural areas, wildlife, habitat, so on and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6438)|
| 1:47:27| and we talked about shrinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| This is about 38 percent of the county, I think, is what we said would be in this hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6451)|
| 1:47:38| and then if we reduced it to just 25 percent or above, that would take that in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6458)|
| 1:47:44| So the question is, is that a significant portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| You're reducing potentially the habitat, the protection for air pollution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6467)|
| 1:47:54| or degradation of the air pollution even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| Those are hard things to come by in terms of understanding where is the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| Is the number really 25 percent or 10 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| But it is something that we need to come up with as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| If we're going to keep some undeveloped land in this county to protect those things that we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6490)|
| 1:48:16| we have to do that, and maybe 25 percent of the land is essentially protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6496)|
| 1:48:22| as non-developable or very limited development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| Maybe that's the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| Maybe it's 38 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| I don't know, but I think that that has to be part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6509)|
| 1:48:36| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| I want to thank the members of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| I think you've done a good job, and it's been well researched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6522)|
| 1:48:48| These are problems that we are confronted with by the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6528)|
| 1:48:54| This is a recommendation, and as we go through the process, it can be tweaked as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6534)|
| 1:49:02| We're not going to solve it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| I think that many people will appreciate trying to maintain the beauty of the land in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6545)|
| 1:49:15| That's my feeling on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| Developers and whatnot, we've got to have a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| Certainly we're going to be building plants, hopefully, for jobs and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6562)|
| 1:49:29| But I want to commend you on what you've done, the work that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| And I don't think we're going to try to solve this thing here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6573)|
| 1:49:38| but I think we should just remember it's a recommendation, and we can tweak it as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6578)|
| 1:49:46| Those are my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| I don't see any other lights right now, so I'll go ahead and echo Mr. Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6590)|
| 1:49:55| and thank the members of the task force for their work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| We have one person signed up for public forum, and that's Ron Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| Come on down, Mr. Peabody, if you state your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6604)|
| 1:50:09| Thank you, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| Ron Peabody, 625 Gay Street, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| I just have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6615)|
| 1:50:21| Commissioner Norman, when you used the number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| it would cost $50,000 to do a notification process for folks impacted by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6626)|
| 1:50:33| How many actual property owners in Knoxville and Knox County would be impacted by the current plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6633)|
| 1:50:39| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| Public forum is not a question and answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| And this is something that's gone back for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| What I'd suggest, Mr. Peabody, is if you have a series of questions, ask those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| and then we can call on somebody to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| But I don't want to start a back and forth here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6652)|
| 1:51:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6660)|
| 1:51:01| That's a question that I'd actually ask one of the city council people then to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| and ask Mr. Norman or whoever would answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| And I guess the other question, the only other question I have, is why is the south Knox waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6669)|
| 1:51:16| why has it been excluded from the plan and the planning pages, as I understand it, as written right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6676)|
| 1:51:23| You know, it seems like a pretty serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| Most of it's on slopes and a lot of it's on ridge lines or, I guess, cliffs, and I guess that's considered a ridge line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6687)|
| 1:51:34| But just kind of curious why that whole area has been excluded from the plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| And I would really appreciate it if one of the council people, I know how this works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| would then ask this question so it would be answered on camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| And quite honestly, Mr. Becker, you may forget that I was at the HUD five-year plan meeting back in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6708)|
| 1:51:55| and I actually was allowed to ask questions, and there were people that answered those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| and you headed that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| So I'd appreciate that leeway at times to be able to ask questions of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| This is a public forum meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| Mr. Norman, would you like to answer the questions that were just asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| I think that probably someone who would be better able to answer the notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| and some of the numbers involved in that would be Mike Carberry or Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6739)|
| 1:52:26| I don't have the exact numbers off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| but I think I'm pretty close that we have identified 62,000 parcels that are within the geography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6749)|
| 1:52:39| that's been defined as the slope protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| So if we sent a 25-cent postcard to all of those, that cost would be on the order of $17,000 to $18,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6762)|
| 1:52:52| If we then also notify the people that are immediately outside of that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| who have just as much stake in the recommendations that are being made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| then that number doubles or triples very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| And if we sent maps, then we're putting things in envelopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6786)|
| 1:53:13| and our cost starts pushing up towards a dollar per parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6793)|
| 1:53:18| and that's where that $60,000 number came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6798)|
| 1:53:26| Okay, and as to the South Knoxville, yeah, go ahead, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| Well, the second question having to do with the South Waterfront, it was not excluded from the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6811)|
| 1:53:39| It was simply excluded from the analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| And the entire redevelopment area does go to some of the hilltops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| It does not include, I believe it goes to the Fort Stanley Hilltop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| which is part of the urban wilderness corridor acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| but the rest of it is just upslope, a good bit of which is already actually residentially developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6833)|
| 1:54:00| But the only area that would be in contention at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| and I don't think it would be in contention, is the area that's been rezoned with form-based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| which is not the full 700-and-something acres, but is, if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| is maybe in the 300-acre range, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| And that is not, none of that is very, very steep, with the exception of maybe the railroad right-of-way bed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6858)|
| 1:54:25| but, well, Baptist Hospital, okay, that's steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| But most of that probably would not fit, you know, the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6870)|
| 1:54:39| And that's been rezoned with form-based code, and so would there be a conflict there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| And, Mr. Peabody, in regard to the third question about process, over the time I've been vice mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| I've done lots of things up here, and I appreciate my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| They usually don't call me in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| They'll come up to me afterwards and say, hey, you know, the rules actually say this, that, or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| So if I've done something in the past and they've come up and said this is not the way it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| I'll change what I'm doing because of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| And that's one that the procedures for public forum don't actually allow a back-and-forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6907)|
| 1:55:12| and if I did allow that before, somebody called me on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| So that's why it's not done now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| I think we're adjourned then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| Thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| We appreciate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| We appreciate all these NPC commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| And, you know, we can talk together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6927)|
| 1:55:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop101028?start=6955)|
